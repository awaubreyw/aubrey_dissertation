Well, I certainly can notice the positive/negative response to image contrast and low audio, but I&#39;m really not sure about the repetition of names and phrases. I think the the nature of repetition with regards to cognitive ease is more complicated than just a straight proportional relationship.<br><br>If I consider my own reactions to repetition, when a name/phrase is repeated and it doesn&#39;t relate to  anything significant within my mind, it&#39;s confusing/irritating as I try to figure out why I should find it familiar. If a name/phrase is identified with negative content (or negative actions) inside my mind, then the more I hear it, the more irritation and dislike I feel towards the subject (e.g. Donald Trump, the Cardashians, Megan Markle), while if a name/phrase is identified with positive content, I feel positive towards it (and hence feel cognitive ease).\u00a0A combination of negative and positive information associated with the one subject creates caution and skepticism as I try to more critically figure out what the situation is. <br><br>In other words: What the subject of repetition is actually related to creates a positive or negative association (and thus cognitive ease or not). This creates a bias, but I am also cognisant that the less reliable information I have about the subject ,the less reliable my opinion is.\u00a0<br><br>Scientific skepticism and analytical thinking is certainly necessary (especially on the internet), even though it can take effort to question the more instinctive type of confirmation bias. But then again, today&#39;s version of skepticism can be a way for people to dismiss what seems unfamiliar or foreign to their everyday lives. E.g. there is no scientific reason that ancient people didn&#39;t develop more advanced technology than we actually think they did, but it sounds ridiculous to most people, no matter how limited their knowledge of archeology. <br><br>....Although, I&#39;m &quot;intuitively&quot; pretty skeptical that unhappiness helps great thought.

There are others who have studied for a decade or more to become experts, such as epidemiologists and climatologists. They never stop learning and teaching. They publish scholarly papers that are peer-reviewed, and in turn they review the papers of their peers. In this way the body of knowledge grows and is shared, and theories that fail this process fall by the wayside. It\u2019s not failsafe, but history supports the view that it is self-correcting. So, for fields such as pandemics and global warming, I turn to these subject matter experts and the media that gives them air-time. I particularly look to media that publishes long-form articles that allow me to understand these complex topics.<br>\r<br>In Australia we\u2019re fortunate that the state and federal governments\u2019 pandemic responses are shaped by their subject-matter experts.

For example, with the K*rdashi*ns, their ubiquity commonly leads to disgust and ire. Or songs on the radio that might&#39;ve been nice at first, but then you get absolutely SICK of it being everywhere. Repetition can make things seem more obnoxious, rather than innocuous. Much like when you eat a food too much and then get sick of it. And this also extends to factoids. There is an &quot;oh not that again&quot; effect. Like that &quot;glass is a liquid&quot; thing, or the tongue-map theory. Increased exposure to something can easily instead lead to disdain. I call it the Funko Pop Effect, personally, given how many people hate them and call them ugly. They&#39;re ubiquitous, but if they weren&#39;t, and if people only saw them extremely rarely, they&#39;d likely think they were simple and cute.<br><br>The other thing is that repeated exposure is what /allows/ people to notice its flaws. More time seeing something means more noticing. Now, obviously, sometimes, there aren&#39;t flaws, because sometimes something /is/ simply true, or the flaws are minor edge-cases that don&#39;t affect the core essence of the thing or statement. It depends. It varies. But, often, increased exposure means /thinking/ about it more, and therefore questioning it, and finding flaws and exceptions.<br><br>And the irony is that I&#39;ve so often heard &quot;the more something is repeated, the more it starts to feel true&quot;, but then, even this video trying to argue that doesn&#39;t make that feel more true. It makes it feel /less/ true, because having this increased familiarity with the concept led to thinking about it more, and noticing the flaws and counterexamples.<br><br>The other thing is that this probably has some relation to the Semmelweis reflex as well, which is something that we need to be more aware of, and be willing and able to overcome.<br><br>But also, there is a difference between cognitive ease and thin-slicing. Cognitive ease isn&#39;t more likely to lead to a correct gut-intuition. It only indicates a general amount of exposure, and one that leads to a bias, rather than indicating /extraction of information/, which is what thin-slicing is. And this video seemed to conflate the two.<br><br>We really do all need to think critically more often. That /doesn&#39;t/ equate to or necessitate analysis-paralysis. Thin-slicing is helpful.

Skepticism is dangerous in the opposite way of gullibility.

You are deceived by pride into thinking your range of knowledge is sufficient for everything you investigate. And you, Derek, are a prime example.

I&#39;ll explain why.<br>The assumption if that the only difference between the two was that the one in the &#39;fancy&#39; font was harder to read. But in reality, what were the differences?<br>a) The &#39;fancy&#39; font was more visually appealing. Hence for many this will mean more pleasant to read.<br>b) The fancy font was justified - i.e. was made visually symmetrical by arranging the lines in this visually appealing way.<br>c) The fancy text used capital letters to start each line.<br><br>Factors b) and c) both have an effect in changing the perception of the material. Specifically, the &#39;plain&#39; font will I believe on average tend the reader to a more linear reading of the text. It&#39;s a single block and you read through it sequentially. Whereas the fancy one presents the information in a more explicitly divided set of 3 parts, 3 separate statements all justified centre and all starting with capital letters. This I suggest will on average encourage the reader, more than the &#39;plain&#39; text, to set these 3 statements in their mind and thus be better able to test the relationships between them in their mind.<br><br>I am not negating the possibility that some modern readers might find it somewhat harder to read a font closer to human handwriting. But it&#39;s these other variables that have, in my opinion, invalidated this experiment. And I would propose a re-test but if possible not even changing the letter size or spacing, only the shape of the individual letters of the font, trying to minimise variables. You might even try it with various different fonts if you have enough participants to test. A font that is harder to read but &#39;ugly&#39;; one that is harder but &#39;beautiful&#39;, and also for the easy to read ones, an &#39;ugly&#39; one and a beautiful one. And perhaps a &#39;neutral&#39; one of each also. <br><br>Such a test, under the additional requirements I mentioned above, should be able to not only tell the effect of the difficulty in reading, but also measure to some degree the emotional effect on the result.

It seems applicable to those who spend an enormous amount of time being mesmerized by the thousands of flashing lights that create a computer screen,  which is almost everyone born in the last thirty years.  My generation, on the other hand, can easily put down a book and change tasks.  Also, most importantly, our schooling involved word and sentence structure, probability, analytical thinking and history.  Fact checking was done in the Library, which contained three types of books;  Fiction, Non-Fiction and Reference.  The computer only offers one kind of information ---Opinion. The fake words would never have fooled me because I learned to discover the meaning of a new word in a dictionary before I continued reading.  Analytical thinking is merely applying the question &quot;Why?&quot;  to every idea presented to me.   I notice when something is repeated, such as the term &quot;gaslighting&quot;, and wonder why.  I heard the name Einstein many times before I was old enough and smart enough to understand his genius.  Everyone knows why Abraham Lincoln and Marlon Brando are famous.  Eventually I had to find out why the Kardashians were famous.  The appalling answer to that question may have been what initially started me wondering what was happening as people replaced books with tweets.  We are entering a frightening Orwellian Tower of Babel world where an increasingly large slice of society is finding its only alternative is to arm itself against the inevitable day of defending their food supply.  My advice is to doubt everything until you satisfy yourself as to why someone said or did or believed a particular thing.  Was it to teach, share or fool you?   Are they selling something or giving something away?  Advertisers control the flow of money on the internet and no one influences the accuracy of the information.  Therefore, everything on the internet is for sale and there is no way to easily determine whether something is fiction or non-fiction.

Simple Natural Truth\r<br>2. Complex Natural Truth\r<br>3. Simple Perceptual Truth\r<br>4. Complex Perceptual Truth\r<br>In the article, before you, each field is explained in detail and shows that absolute truth is attainable and in fact, we live it every day, absolutely.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>1.\tSimple Natural Truth\r<br>This is the science of facts. Simple natural truths are the facts of materialistic life \u2014 the sciences: physics, biology, chemistry, etc. A simple natural truth will come in the form of a statement of fact. For example, the Sun is a star in the universe. This is a proven scientific fact. Certain Flora utilizes chlorophyll to convert sunlight into energy; this is a proven biological fact. The molecular structure of a Hydrogen atom has a one-electron shell; this is a fact of molecular physics. Salt is made up of Sodium Nitrate; this is a chemical fact.\r<br>Another context of this kind of truth is the science or philosophy of facts. The known natural world is abundant with facts. These basic facts are global if not cosmic in their scope. Such facts as mentioned above and many others of a similar nature are the basis of a unified language. The physical universe is abundant with natural facts, truths, all making up the functions of physical existence. Natural facts, indisputable facts are simple natural truths.\r<br>Summary: Simple Natural Truths are indisputable facts no matter which forms of intelligence were to perceive them.\r<br>\r<br>2.\tComplex Natural Truth\r<br>These are the partially proven theories and facts of discovery. Einstein&#39;s Unified field theory is an unproven theory based on scientific facts. It is a complex truth, however, to fully appreciate a complex natural truth, let us review the problem of a fusion energy unit. Cold Fusion energy is a theoretical fact; a truth that states that by forcing molecule and atoms to compress into themselves, the energies released will be extreme in comparison to the energy expended in the compression process. This theory in a more scientific gender is an unproven theory of physics but is a mixture of simple natural truths and human theoretic. The general consensus of scientists has proven theoretically beyond any doubt, that such a process is possible, as it is already being done in the Sun and other stars, in the explosions of nuclear weapons and other such large energy sources. Therefore, the complex natural truth is that an artificially stable and controllable fusion energy unit can be realized.\r<br>Complex facts, facts based upon theories partially proven, some non-provable but theoretically sound such as the theories of the reasons for existence, facts that are negative rather than positive are all a form of complex natural truths. Medicine is abundant with complex natural facts, all dealing with diagnoses, treatments, and results.\r<br>Summary: Complex Natural Truths are truths of unsubstantiated facts that are reached by any intelligence no matter how they perceive them.\r<br>\r<br>3.\tSimple Perceptual Truth\r<br>A simple perceptual truth is the personal truth of every self-aware living organism \u2014 for example, two people sitting on a park bench both experiences similar but different facts. Let us expand this a stage, the sun is shining, the sky is clear, the mean temperature is 28 degrees Celsius, the park bench was painted dark green, and the sky is an azure blue.\r<br>One person feels the temperature and translates it as being warm, this is the perception of heat by the body and is a biological fact. It is the person&#39;s perceptual truth. The other person feels cold; the second person feels it is also a perceptual truth. If they were to discuss the weather, one would say to the other &quot;It is warm today,&quot; the others reply might be &quot;The sun is shining, but I feel Cold.&quot; Here we receive a contradiction of perceptual truths based on natural facts. The temperature is a natural fact, a truth of nature. The human&#39;s body to discern temperature and translate equally along a human race mean is a medical fact. However, each human organism feels heat differently for biological and mental reasons. Both people feel the temperature. Differently, both experience a perception of a natural fact and thus reach a perceptual truth based on their own realities.\r<br>One person might say the sky is azure; the other might say it is cyan. The human visual senses differ for each person. The extremes are color blindness. However, there are other organisms that see at different wavelengths and colors. Thus, color is a personal perception of a natural fact, a perceptual truth.\r<br>No matter how we analyze our surroundings, each person&#39;s perception is different, and each person concludes differently based on the information perceived.\r<br>Summary: Simple Perceptual Truths are the facts as perceived by any single intelligent entity.\r<br>\r<br>4.\tComplex Perceptual Truth\r<br>The final limb of truth is the complex perception of an idea. This truth is based on the views of a human mind. One mind might perceive that a totalitarian society utilizing the truths developed by the suggesting mind is the only way society might reach utopia. This is a perception of a system for many, rather than a personal perception of a natural fact.\r<br>The way in which complex perceptual truths are utilized differs per person. Some try to explain, others use force and yet a third group might keep the idea a secret.\r<br>Complex perceptual truths require the acceptance of a number of individuals believing in the same set of mental ideas rather than a set of physiological feelings. Religion is a classic example of complex perceptual truth, whereby the belief in a deity and the ritual to appease such deity as agreed to and performed by a number of individuals in the presence of a complex perceptual truth. Theology is an example in applying the scientific method to belief and the Thomas Aquinas\u2019 \u201cleap of faith\u201d is an example of non-rational behavior in order to prove a complex perceptual truth.\r<br>Summary: Complex Perceptual Truths are the facts as perceived equally by a group of intelligent entities or as perceived by a single intelligent entity and enforced or persuaded upon a group of other single entities who perceive it equally or indifferently, however, the case may be.\r<br>\r<br>Conclusions\r<br>We live in a world of contradictions where belief and scientific method meet head-on in the daily argument. Truth is about reality and fiction since truth is a concept coined by the human animal. Truth has been shown to be about facts, scientific facts proven via the scientific method. However, the truth is also about perception and understanding of our environment and our interaction with other humans. This interaction and perception on an individual level as well as on a plural level lead to truths both individual and plural. They are true for they are perceptions of ideas and beliefs that cannot be disproved or proven by scientific method since their complexity is infinite, taking into account individual interactivity within its own mind or within a group and part of a groups mindset and as such go beyond any scientific methodology to prove a naturally proven fact or truth.", "comment_date": "2021-02-13T22:51:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaushal patel", "comment_text": "That&#39;s how teflon politicians are born with a good media partners\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-02-13T21:40:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Braden Wilson", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebFWOlx848&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a> is that the sanford collegiate yearbook?

I&#39;m a very analytical mind &amp; I write well. I even have a new laugh &amp; it makes me very still. I forget to breath. I never believed a person could die laughing, but now, I&#39;m not so sure. (You want good moods and good stuff to happen? practice to be honest a couple of weeks &amp; see what happens . It&#39;s like having a demon nit shampoo\ud83d\ude09. two weeks twice a year minimum, &amp; no taking days off. Absolutely not. &amp; and hide the breakables. Simples. <br><br>Here&#39;s a staff written this morning which I did not post on Mind Ark\ud83d\udc83. They were really just in preparation for truth therapy\ud83d\ude09. I thought I&#39;d clean out my older demons this week.  It&#39;s like picking seashells. The difference between these ones &amp; the baddies is that you have to find these ones. Search for em like Easter eggs. They&#39;re things like, resentment for Christmas coz only my dad did Christmas, or, not saying what I&#39;d really want to say to an ex boyfriend so I wouldn&#39;t get in trouble, I think Shannon Doherty&#39;s in there, &amp; Phoebe from friends, old alter egos of mins. I used them to get through doors at parties. I was always so shy walking into a room. I had more belief in them than myself sometimes. These demons are what I call &quot;the pity party&quot;. Pretty sure they&#39;re still teenagers.  Anyway, whatever undesirable thoughts I&#39;d used them as a bandaid for will probably have decomposed beneath by now. When. If you don&#39;t use it, you lose it. Where you&#39;ll discover these &quot;seashell demons&quot; is when you&#39;re thinking &amp; a thought stands out like a bright star because it lacks imperfection. Demons are extreme try-hards for attention &amp; gratitude. They can turn poltergeist if you aren&#39;t strict with them &amp; swift to move them on. <br><br>So, I thought maybe you might find some of what I write relative to your work  it&#39;s all free. Everything I write is free.  Right now i&#39;m working on a rise of consciousness of some without others via a division via ripple effect, &amp; spontaneous generation. *shrug*. I&#39;m impatient, &amp; truth moves faster than light. We make a great team.<br><br>Reality, does it ebb &amp; flow in the spaces of difference twixt perfection &amp; imperfection of all perfect for their imperfection. Man, should he\u00a0see both the perfection &amp; imperfection at once as conjoined?  <br>We may never see evidence, that if time only ticked forward, it would not tick either back or forth period.\u00a0 I&#39;ll give it a shot.\u00a0 If I&#39;m to write on shape-shifting for example, &amp; i notice a piece of the puzzle that makes immediate sense but lacks imperfection, (eg. &quot;everything in nature is floored&quot;)\u00a0. <br>\u00a0erhaps the proof of past expansion is in that, the very notion &quot;everything in nature is floored&quot; is itself not floored, &amp; so it stands out as noticeably perfect &amp; quite odd. It doesn&#39;t appear to be perfect in its imperfection such as we clearly notice natural things to be.<br><br> \ud83d\ude42What is unnatural, will be unnatural to expect to ebb &amp; flow in the difference betwixt itself, or contribute to time expansion in any direction. There&#39;s an old saying that goes &quot;If something seems too good to be true, it probably is&quot;.\u00a0\u00a0I don&#39;t think you need to read this twice to get it.

That synesthetic magic that neurotypical people have. x_x So that&#39;s what it&#39;s called (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebFWOlx848&amp;t=5m21s\">5:21</a>) huh? I just referred to it as abstract association, although that&#39;s a bit vague. I never really thought about some of these things being related so I just thought they were separate issues, but thinking back on it and connecting the dots that makes a ton of sense. <br><br>Language is one of those inherent synesthetic abilities I lack, so communication is always a conscious effort for me. When I come up with what to say it&#39;s the same process as when I&#39;m doing math, and I think everyone goes through the same mental process when doing math homework so you can get the idea from that. Basically I have to actually go back through all my memories to find associations in order to translate my thoughts into something people can perceive, so that creates significant limits. Not so much because of the time like you&#39;re probably thinking, but because there&#39;re so many possibilities it&#39;s hard to guess which one is correct in the moment. <br><br>I mean time is a problem too, but since the world is basically in slow motion for me I can track through quite a lot of memories in a short time. Understanding information is a lot faster than translating my thoughts correctly though. Most words don&#39;t have a ton of different meanings, so it&#39;s not often that hard to quickly find the associations in my memories. <br><br>The problem is that everyone else makes tons of illogical inferences and assumptions, getting all kinds of unrelated interpretations to different words and word orders that change at different times with no distinctive pattern. It can take hours to write a long message (like this one) because I have to check all my memories and run scenarios in my head in an effort to predict how the person will take it. Otherwise I might end up in a situation where I was just be asking if someone enjoyed their visit and they leave thinking I believe their grandmother is goat or whatever random nonsense people come up with. <br><br>So that&#39;s one thing, but then like with the gullible thing you mentioned I didn&#39;t even realize that was related. I just never understood why people were so easily manipulated by such mundane things, it never made sense to me. I understood subliminal messaging as a manipulation of our dumb subconscious which can&#39;t distinguish the difference between the thing we like being shown (happy family, cute dog, whatever) and the product, and then giving us that positive emotion when we later go looking to purchase that new whatever we need. However I didn&#39;t realize that was the same thing as why people like someone for no good reason, or judge nonsense words positively because they saw them more. I mean my brain just doesn&#39;t work like that, so I can&#39;t know exactly what it&#39;s all like for people who do experience that unless it&#39;s explained. <br><br>Plus when I was a kid I was widely considered extremely gullible, so that was a significant setback towards my grasping that association. It doesn&#39;t make sense that gullibility is an aspect of a cognitive function that I don&#39;t have, until one realizes that &quot;gullible&quot; isn&#39;t a trait (like how people use the word) but rather refers to an effect. In this case both the trait &quot;cognitive ease&quot; and the lack of the trait can cause someone to be fooled. <br><br>My lack of cognitive ease causes gullibility by the fact that I don&#39;t subconsciously perceive any difference between lying and telling the truth, I don&#39;t have a &quot;gut feeling&quot; so my only option is conscious analysis. A skill which I wasn&#39;t very good at as a child while I was still developing it. So that lack of intuition was what I always thought people were referring to by the word &quot;gullible.&quot; <br><br>I can see there&#39;s a lot of benefits to the trait, but overall I&#39;d say lacking it is more beneficial in modern society. At least for someone with decent intelligence, the downsides well exampled by the stereotype for nonverbal type autistics like myself. However that stereotype isn&#39;t even about people with autism, it&#39;s about people with mental retardation (a technical definition for someone of an IQ below 70; the antonym of genius) who also has autism. <br><br>Since both are quite rare it&#39;s extremely rare for someone to have both issue, but when they do it does make it impossible to communicate. Thanks to that stereotype though when most people with autism come out they&#39;re met with &quot;Omg, you&#39;re autistic?! You don&#39;t <i>look</i> autistic.&quot; <br><br>IQ is unrelated to autism or any of the other cognitive conditions, being a specific thing in and of itself having to do with separate genetic factors related more to physical development than the mind. Like everyone else, the majority of autistics are of average intelligence and don&#39;t have significant trouble functioning in society. Maybe labelled as mean or cold due to lacking an understanding of cognitive ease, but do just as well in school and other tasks. There&#39;s a reason why data indicates that it&#39;s the most often mental condition for doctors to fail to diagnose.<br><br>Similarly a person who is retarded does poorly in school, but otherwise fits in fine in society. Given average social aptitude and the ability to excel in nontechnical fields, like sanitation, sports, acting, et cetera. Actually nowadays there are special education program designed to teach to their strengths so that they can graduate high school, and even go on to a technical school or something if they want. <br><br>Because they can have decent to good social skills, they&#39;re ironically less likely to be taken for someone with mental retardation than someone who is just socially awkward. I&#39;m not sure how the general public constantly mixes up social intelligence (EQ) with academic intelligence (IQ). But I&#39;ve digressed from the point, so I&#39;ll get back to that.<br><br>Sure I can&#39;t inherently know if someone is being sarcastic, asking a rhetorical question, nor infer usually inaccurate nonsense from meaningless things like tone which can be altered by something as simple as room temperature. But do those things really benefit society? I also can&#39;t intentionally lie because I don&#39;t understand how cognitive ease works, I can&#39;t be fooled by lies anymore because knowing it&#39;s a possibility I always use conscious analysis, I&#39;m immune to manipulation that relies on cognitive ease, even that issue he mentioned about taking 30 minutes to pick a toothbrush hasn&#39;t been one since I was a kid because I&#39;ve developed mental systems of quantifying value so I can make decisions quickly like simple math, and if everyone lacked cognitive ease I wouldn&#39;t have to spend any more time than anyone else on messages because I wouldn&#39;t have to worry that people were going to have some insane interpretation of the words I&#39;m using to express the concepts I&#39;m trying to share.", "comment_date": "2020-12-16T06:47:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "St\u00e9phane", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebFWOlx848&amp;t=4m08s\">4:08</a> Who else thought that they couldn&#39;t chose one, because they didn&#39;t know the answer?", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T05:38:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "deancook_net", "comment_text": "You cite neuroscience research here, and then note in a later video that a lot of that research is probably not verifiable or repeatable.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q&amp;t=315s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q&amp;t=315s</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T23:25:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "christoforos meziriadis", "comment_text": "What if the statement \u201cthe illusion of truth\u201d is an illusion ?", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T12:44:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vinay kaushik", "comment_text": "Love your videos...", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T07:19:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "epichappy happy", "comment_text": "When I got slightly ear rapped by the bad contrast video I immediately started smiling and I felt joy, thank you hundreds of meme compilations.", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T17:24:15Z", "likes_count": 116}, {"comment_by": "Dave Cullins", "comment_text": "&quot;The election was rigged!&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T15:39:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elon Must", "comment_text": "In reality he just repeated &quot;The more things get repeated, the more they start to feel true&quot; to fool us, because this fact is also not true", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T20:34:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aakash Kumar", "comment_text": "Who r Kardasians?", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T00:40:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KanMedLife", "comment_text": "This is how YouTube algorithm has hacked our minds !", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T11:31:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Groller", "comment_text": "sounds like brain washing to me.", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T00:21:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paavo Bergmann", "comment_text": "Repetition legitimizes.

Yes, it takes longer to decide things, but recovering from mistakes born of haste is often MUCH more costly (in terms of time, not to mention other limited resources) than the thinking time/effort. There is a reason that we need to be constantly reminded that &quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot;, &quot;look before you leap&quot;, &quot;measure twice, cut once&quot;, &quot;work smarter, not harder&quot;, &quot;a stitch in time saves nine&quot;, etc.<br><br>I believe that one major reason we don&#39;t do more slow effortful thinking is culture.

The Bible states that no one is good: we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, you have very probably at least once in your life lied, or stolen something even if it was small, probably you have often used God&#39;s name in vain (as in omg) which is called blasphemy, you have for sure had sexual thoughts about someone, so to sum it all up: you would be a lying, thieving blasphemus adulteror at heart, which is only 4 of the 10 commandments and you probably have broken them all. And for this we deserve hell! One single sin is enough to send you to hell.\u00a0 And by doing good deeds, like loving everyone helping people ecc... we can not possibly cancel our previous sins and gain the favour of God. The only way we can get to heaven is through the Lord Jesus! I will explain that better: God has His Holy and just wrath prepared to fall upon all sinners, and we completely deserve that, but in God&#39;s infinite mercy He sent his only begotten Son to live a perfect life on this earth (something we could not possibly do ourselves) and to finally die on the cross bearing our sins and taking upon Himself the wrath of God that was supposed to be for us! True conversion is realizing that we are completely lost and putting our whole trust in the Lord Jesus and we will be cleansed by His blood, because He already bore our sins! In this way The Father will see us as pure through Jesus! As proof of our salvation we will automatically start hating the sin we once were slaves to and we will love God and His commandements!

The images used to illustrate this point are also deceptive. Humans are instinctively attracted to light and to warm colours, so the image of a warmly illuminated Golden Gate Bridge is particularly attractive for reasons in addition to its high contrast.

It seems logical, for most of us, that would be the first letter you ever learned, helping to define the concept of a letter, the concept of reading.<br>The Kardashians also look symmetrical in their faces, coming close to the platonic model of a face, which is what generally is considered beauty.<br>Cognitive ease also explains why rhyming was considered true (and this principle is still used in advertising)<br>This repeats some of the Drew/Gun video.<br>Like your point, there is a lot of misinformation out there and people should be more aware of the pitfalls of the brain.<br><br>I was hoping you&#39;d go in the direction of: there is no absolute truth, therefore all truth is an illusion (to a degree). For instance by saying that usually there is a lot of context that is NOT explained with a truth, like in statistics or basically any fact. This is not a conscious thing, but because of conscious ease, things that are more accurate and therefore more true for most people feel less true.<br>Or we cannot experience the world directly, but only through our senses, and then we cherry pick the results automatically, that kind of thing.<br>Things don&#39;t really get bigger when they come closer (or come closer when they appear bigger), but that is the lie we believe without thinking.<br><br>All people are stuck in this to some degree. But some people have a really closed mindset and strong opinions about what is True.<br>Exposing these people to the actual facts has an opposite effect than you might think, they get more stuck, they dig in... Like with flat-earthers. How can it be more likely to think it&#39;s all one big conspiracy then thinking that you are wrong..? But being wrong is the least cognitively easy thing there is.<br>Therefore you should approach everything expecting to be wrong (if you want to avoid the pitfalls, that is.. because indeed this doesn&#39;t make you happy). I once got the choice: &quot;Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?&quot; I think that sums it up, really.. That&#39;s wisdom..<br>I personally think happiness should be like taking of your tight shoes at the end of a long day. And if you don&#39;t have tight shoes you will be more careless, but not necessarily happier. But this balance is different in everybody.

Then we can represent the thing that you asked them to assess (not an English sentence, because I wrote it above as three English sentences) by the propositional notation <br><br>(p &amp; q) ---&gt;r.<br><br>No doubt, all of your interviewees have seen a faded rose, or already believes that r is true. Consequently, it is reasonable for them to answer with &quot;yes&quot;, because any prepositional truth assignment that assigns the truth value &quot;true&quot; to r must assign the truth value &quot;true&quot; to (p &amp; q) ---&gt;r.  <br><br>Thus you made an error in pedagogy.   Your question to them does not remove enough of the world that they have observed to force them to think in terms of predicate logic, and to force them to discern between necessary truth and contingent truth. In fact, to most people, the distinction between truth and necessary truth is lost, not because of the way our brains are wired to accept as true things which are repeated to us often, as you intimated, but because most people aren&#39;t educated in that very distinction which your example is intended to illustrate. If you had asked them in a different way, then you&#39;re likely to have elicited from them a correct answer (at least more often).  <br><br>Pedagogically, this could have been done through the use of a fictional world. For example, you could have told them that you&#39;re writing an episode of &quot;The Orville&quot;, and you&#39;re having the crew meet a new race, the Blegvard, from a planet with three suns. Then you could say that some Blegvardian&#39;s skin tone fades. Then you could ask them if it necessarily follows that rose colored Blegvardian&#39;s skin tone fades. This would be like asking them if every person watching your episode would have to conclude from seeing that there&#39;s a green Blegvardian whose skin tone fades that the skin tone of all Blegvardians fades. This is the first order error that you seemed (to me) to think you were eliciting in asking about roses, namely an error in quantifier usage. If we denote by r&#39; the statement &quot;The skin of some rose toned Blegvardians fades.&quot;, then r&#39; is analogous to the statement r in my illustration above of your example with roses. Let&#39;s denote by p&#39; the statement &quot;All rose toned Blegvardians are Blegvardians.&quot;, and by q&#39;, let&#39;s mean the statement &quot;Some Blegvardian&#39;s skin fades.&quot;.  Then the truth of the statement <br><br>(p&#39; &amp; q&#39;) ---&gt;r&#39;  <br><br>cannot be determined based solely on the information that we see in your episode that done green toned Blegvardian&#39;s skin faded. This then highlights the need for a predicate formulation (in first order logic or higher order logic) of the sentences in question. Let B(x) denote the claim &quot;x is a Blegvardian&quot;, let F(x) denote &quot;the skin tone of x faded&quot;, let R(x) denote &quot;x is a rose toned Blegvardian&quot;.  Then p&#39; is the sentence (\\forall x)[R(x)---&gt;B (x)], q&#39; is the sentence (\\exists y)[B(y)---&gt;F (y)], and r&#39; is the sentence (\\exists z)[R(z)&amp;F (z)].  Thus you could have asked them if the following sentence is necessarily true:<br><br>[(\\forall x)[R(x)---&gt;B (x)]&amp;(\\exists y)[B(y)---&gt;F (y)]]---&gt;(\\exists z)[R(z)&amp;F (z)].<br><br>To most people on the street, this may appear complicated, but I assure you that with the proper education in simple first order logic, it is not complicated at all. But the use of different variables in my first order formulation is not necessary. I could have used the variable x in all three of p&#39;, q&#39;, and r&#39;.  However, doing so would more likely lead some people with less practice to get the wrong answer due to a technicality, and NOT due to a lack of understanding of the distinction between quantifiers or the inability to recognize (at least intuitively) an incorrect usage of syllogism. This is why I formulated the first order version of the problem using three distinct variables:  I want to give an example of the same propositional form as yours that will illustrate the distinction between necessary truth and contingent truth, without biasing the audience with an appeal to their knowledge or belief about the (necessarily contingent) truth of the claim r&#39;. <br><br>Then, anyone who answers that the statement<br><br>[(\\forall x)[R(x)---&gt;B (x)]&amp;(\\exists y)[B(y)---&gt;F (y)]]---&gt;(\\exists z)[R(z)&amp;F (z)]<br><br> Is necessarily true,  or equivalently, that the argument &quot;We saw a Blegvardian&#39;s skin fade, so some rose toned Blegvardian&#39;s skin fades.&quot; is a valid argument, necessarily either is undereducated in logic for the problem at hand, or may have a cognitive disability of some sort.", "comment_date": "2018-01-05T12:59:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Dance", "comment_text": "this channel is amazing i&#39;m sorry i didn&#39;t subscribe earlier", "comment_date": "2018-01-05T12:02:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Peyron", "comment_text": "Since I&#39;m biased and primed; this video seems like it was concieved after reading Daniel Kahneman&#39;s book &quot;Thinking Fast &amp; Slow&quot;.

To explain:     The last statement saying something to the effect: &quot;... therefore some roses fade quickly.&quot; contains a logical fallacy that points us towards the correct answer. -- Logically it&#39;s impossible for &#39;some roses&#39; to fade quickly within the context of the previous two statements: &quot;All roses are flowers, some flowers fade quickly&quot; because we aren&#39;t subdividing the set of flowers that fade quickly therefore either the set containing all roses will fade quickly or the entire set won&#39;t - the set of roses won&#39;t be included in the set of &#39;some flowers fade quickly&#39;, to break this would be to either mean this subset of roses who fade can no longer be called roses or the initial set of roses doesn&#39;t contain everything called a rose - which is paradoxical. So then you must either replace the word &#39;roses&#39; with &#39;flowers&#39; in last statement &#39;therefore some roses fade quickly&#39; - which is logically valid given that &#39;some flowers&#39; contain the set of all roses where the set of &#39;some roses&#39; cannot (I&#39;m short-cutting having to deal with the infinities related to the endless subdividing the set of roses into endless subdivisions of subdivisions etc you would get if you allow a subset of roses to fade quickly - either the entire set of roses can or it can&#39;t - regardless you still end up at the same conclusion) - or you must conclude that the statements are logically absurd to which it would literally be meaningless to attach a true or false value to.              Include with this the fact that we don&#39;t know given the information within the three statements whether or not the set in the third statement &#39;some roses&#39; includes the set of roses we can only give an answer regarding whether the statement is true or false as some probability regarding whether or not true or false is more likely and given that they are both exactly equally likely to occur we must conclude that the answer is both true and false at exactly the same time -- until such a time we can determine with certainty if the set &#39;some flowers&#39; contains the set of roses.         So the actual answer to the question is either a; the question is invalid or b; both true and false are both correct but not either individually.", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T19:59:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hole Guy", "comment_text": "that explains emotions", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T13:08:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emilio Jose Medina", "comment_text": "WBV", "comment_date": "2017-09-22T00:00:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jump Toit", "comment_text": "Objectivity can be gained through intersubjectivity.

It&#39;s easier to not be aware.  Being aware is hard to accept.  The difference between how we end up thinking and acting due to all this, and what would be our potential if we thought at a highly critical level (or were collectively fully committed in a society way to acknowledging it&#39;s actual core essential relevance to and impact on &#39;everything&#39;) is so huge it&#39;s &#39;hard to watch&#39;.  Humanity is from this perspective is often a grotesque, disturbing train wreck that is &#39;hard to watch&#39;. This may see foreign but if  you are a critical thinker, and a bit neurotic (which sometimes go together)and also prone to a bit of anxiety (also not uncommon) you may understand.  When you see someone do something &#39;crazy&#39; and you think, say, and feel &#39;how could they do such a thing?&#39;.  That&#39;s how it feels to realize how far from decent thinkers we collectively are collectively.  How can we be this way? (rhetorical).

It also doesn&#39;t help your popularity, to say the least.  And there is always and endless stream of examples of various degrees both distant, and personal if you engage in personal discussion.  The rose example was actually difficult to not get right.  It seemingly should be &#39;natural&#39; to get it right...without training or study.

Every experiment you produced seems heavily flawed. The live interview for that roses question was answered that way because it was a question that seemed to have no right answer and the fact that roses wilt was the thing that registered while the some part was pretty hard to equate to true or false. It might be possible that roses usually don&#39;t fade quickly or possible that roses usually do fade quickly depending on the person&#39;s understanding of roses or even the source of roses they collect from. Additionally, the style of the question and questioning brings to mind a lecture, where the right answer is expected to be given to the student after they fail. Lastly, the idea that some flowers fade quickly could be seen as a ratio thing. If &quot;some&quot; - a ratio of flowers - wilts quickly, that ratio would still apply to the roses. Most people do not think about how different species of flowers would wilt at different rates. When a weird question like that is asked, you try to answer with your familiarity and understanding as best as possible, especially when the question is not repeated nor a type of question the person has likely been adjusted to answering within their life time. (There are many, many times when spoken questions are answered poorly until someone else in an audience gets a question correct and the people can start thinking alongside the psychology of the person asking the question.) When it is presented in test format on a piece of paper, people have different expectations. With the hard-to-read font used, most people would associate it with novelty information - books that are not fact-checked and scientific.

All the facts I&#39;ve ever seen run counter to it, and the only &quot;proof&quot; I&#39;ve seen presented that hasn&#39;t been proven false (by facts) are mathematical models, which aren&#39;t facts, they&#39;re educated guesses (and have already been repeatedly disproven by time or proof of invalid data and replaced with new models).  As a mathematician, I can tell you that models are nothing but a best guess scenario, and the more variables are involved, the less likely your result is to be accurate.  Needless to say, global climate is impacted by a massive number of variables, making accurate mathematical prediction near impossible (except through sheer luck).  However, due to &quot;the illusion of truth&quot; many fall for this and all the legislation they try to push in its name.  This is made even easier by the fact that the climate is ALWAYS changing, whether we do anything or not, as it has since the Earth was formed, making it the perfect tool, since any individual anomaly can then be blamed on Climate Change, regardless of the actual reason.  Worse than that, it distracts away from the REAL environmental issue we CAN have an impact on, pollution.  I&#39;m an environmentalist, seeking changes based on facts, not politically pushed falsehoods.  Look at how often Climate Change, which is unproven, is thrown around, while the real, proven threat of pollution (not carbon dioxide, but actual toxic pollution of air, oceans &amp; groundwater), which CAN be directly linked to poor manufacturing practices &amp; other human activities.  However, problems that CAN be solved aren&#39;t nearly as useful to idealists &amp; politicians as a nebulous idea that can be blamed for anything &amp; never like be actually resolved to any degree of satisfaction, even if it were to finally be proven.  The same can be said for a lot of other political ideas being used to push for regulations right now, but the irony of this particular one given the source of the video is what blew my mind.", "comment_date": "2016-07-21T14:48:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T\u00faccii", "comment_text": "It would have really fucked with my head if he said that cognitive wasn&#39;t a real thing and it was just him repeating a phrase that means something else.", "comment_date": "2016-07-21T14:48:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mick Assbrock", "comment_text": "14x37=518", "comment_date": "2016-07-21T14:48:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "saber", "comment_text": "518", "comment_date": "2016-07-21T14:47:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Brown", "comment_text": "The people in this comment section have an incredible lack of self awareness.", "comment_date": "2016-07-21T14:46:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vrishabh Lakhani", "comment_text": "The secret to Trump&#39;s success.", "comment_date": "2016-07-21T14:46:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madger Bole", "comment_text": "We developed language and writing and we&#39;re thus perserving information for next generations, true or not.
