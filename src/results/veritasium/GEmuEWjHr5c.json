THEREFORE, objects AND MEN fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma.\u00a0<br><br><br>E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Great !!!<br><br><br>Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS TIME DILATION ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. This explains the PERPETUAL motion of WHAT IS THE EARTH/ground on balance, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. SO, I have mathematically unified physics/physical experience; AS I have mathematically proven why and how the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution AS WELL !!!! CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHAT IS THE SUN !! GREAT. E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. NOW, consider what is the speed of light (c). Accordingly, I have explained why the planets move away very, very, very slightly in comparison to what is THE SUN. It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Stellar clustering ALSO proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 IS clearly F=ma ON BALANCE. Indeed, HALF of the galaxies are &quot;dead&quot; or inert. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy on balance.\u00a0<br><br><br>By Frank DiMeglio", "comment_date": "2021-11-13T16:22:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Scientific ", "comment_text": "As a future science educator this is probably the best 7 min video I&#39;ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2021-11-13T13:36:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manpreet Brar", "comment_text": "This guy talks at perfect speed and very clearly even for an indian, normally i have to watch vids in 1.25x or 1.50x", "comment_date": "2021-11-13T09:32:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galv140577", "comment_text": "&quot;The Most Persistent Myth&quot; <br>How about the myth that srugical masks stop viruses from spreading?<br>Let&#39;s be scientific about it.<br>A piece of cloth is about as effective for stopping viruses as chain-link fences are for stopping mosquitos, but people can argue that the invisible viruses are suspended in invisible water &quot;droplets&quot; (the water in your breath is actually vapour not droplets unless it&#39;s cold enough for it condense, and then you can actually see the water droplets as a fine mist).

Yes I&#39;ve had such teachers but I can count them on 2 fingers... the majority of them drove me to become a school dropout and robbed me from my personal time for being who I am.<br><br>I have ASD and ADD and because I have a great amount of imagination, I read slow due to my mind imagining every single detail about the text that I read. Due to me constantly having to fidget, rock my chair etc to sooth my mind, teachers constantly punished me for something I have no control over. Supposedly less than 1 in 1000 people have an IQ as high as mine and my mind is a sponge that soaks up information. I lack communication skills and social skills however and I get terribly uncomfortable by strange smells, bright colours, noises and so on.<br>If you combine that with teachers nor parents who are aware of the underlying issues, you&#39;ve got a perfect recipe for disaster for the education of the kid and that is exactly what happened to me. Not only was school very slow and boring to me, I also got picked on by nearly every teacher I ever had. The fact that as a kid, I didn&#39;t understand the social repercussion of disagreeing with or correcting teachers when they were wrong, made my childhood a living hell. I still don&#39;t have a degree and even if someone would pay me to go back to class and teacher, the idea just gives me so much anxiety that I decline.<br><br>For people like me (&gt;150 million people in the world), video and audio courses ARE the ideal way to learn and unleash all the potential. I now work in IT and everywhere I&#39;ve come so far, I&#39;ve been considered exceptionally good at what I do. I&#39;ve been promoted over peers with university degrees and much more experience, learn a lot faster and my ability to think out of the box makes me solve problems that the average person thinks is impossible.<br>I don&#39;t have my teachers to thank for that however. After I dropped out of school, I started to learn by myself from whatever information was freely available on the internet. Especially video courses were of great help to me to advance fast enough but since everyone is different, I&#39;m sure audio books or just regular books without a teacher could work for them.<br><br>The regular education system IS imo a very bad system because, like you say, it goes too slow for some, too fast for others and only a portion of the students are helped with it. Many teachers (from my experience most) are bullies and don&#39;t care about individuals. No teacher has ever unlocked an interest or motivation for me, quite the opposite in fact. And even though the media reports that students have suffered so badly during Covid-19 lockdowns, it&#39;s only a few that have the loudest voices. When I talk to people, most say the transfer and absorption of information is not the issue, just the lack of social interaction, which you can have outside of school too. Without the lockdowns, I&#39;m sure a lot of people would prefer (at least part-time) remote education where they can learn in their own time at their own pace and still see friends outside of class.<br>If the education system would allow that choice, class rooms would only be half as full and the students who actually need a teacher to be present would be better off as well because they could get more personal attention. You&#39;d have less traffic on the roads, less polution, happier people, ... it&#39;d be a win-win solution for everybody on the planet.", "comment_date": "2021-09-08T15:59:29Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Bogdan T\u0103n\u0103soiu", "comment_text": "Cloning Derek for every class will revolutionize education.

Similarly in education, other people around you of a similar level learning the same thing at the same time adds an atmosphere and excitement. You can see others struggle with the same problems or observe someone succeed and know you can too. Other people might ask a question that you haven&#39;t thought of or one you were just too scared to ask.

So a key element is indeed inside the head, but as humans evolve so do the way generations learn, social behaviors are now more likely to interact through mobile than face to face. In other words, there is a large percentage of people that are going to learn easier from videos than from reading, and there seems to be already a transition, more people are adapted to hear than to read. So, the paradigm will change not only because the technology will change, will change because the generation of people is changing even faster than the same technology (inside the head there is a change in new generations). There are a couple of well know papers and many videos about how more students have less capacity to concentrate and need more activities, promoting more animations to capture their attention and to allow them to understand things without the teacher (blended or self-paced courses). One last thing is what is learning now in formal education is changing as informal with simple google (people learn about many topics every day with a simple search).", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T15:12:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wesley Verity", "comment_text": "Hold on, motion picture is absolutely huge for visuals learners.

In schools, we try to teach kids things that they don&#39;t think they need to know - the ONLY reason to learn (say) calculus is that you&#39;re being given a test on calculus at the end of the semester and you need to pass it.   That&#39;s a TERRIBLE way to do it.  Good example, my son (in pre-teens) and I were working on writing a simple &quot;platformer&quot; video game together.  He needed to have his character jump - and he couldn&#39;t get it to look right.  I realized that although he&#39;d theoretically been taught Newtons Laws of Motion - he&#39;d had no reason to use it or care about it.  But when I pointed out that this is what determines how his game character flew through the air - he hit up Wikipedia, devoured the math and had his game character doing what he wanted.   It actually doesn&#39;t matter whether those equations came from a book or lecture notes or a video or...ANYTHING...what mattered was that he suddenly had a &quot;Need To Know&quot;.  That&#39;s the key here...pushing information into someone&#39;s head is a major struggle.   Getting the person to the point where they&#39;re hungry for the information isn&#39;t.   I had a friend who was a math teacher - he had to teach some basic statistics and frequency charts - and there was an exercise to have the kids roll dice and plot charts and such...urgh.   So he and I sat down one evening with 100 dice and we drilled out all of the &quot;1&quot; spots and dropped molten lead into the holes, filling the holes in and painting them white.   The kids were told nothing - but during the exercise, they started noticing that they were getting a hell of a lot of 6&#39;s...the teacher wonders aloud...&quot;surely that can&#39;t be right?&quot;...and then the kids were inspired...and they learned how statistics could prove that these dice had been tampered with.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T14:29:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Likebutton", "comment_text": "&quot;Derek has died of Dysentery&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T14:27:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy Javier", "comment_text": "they only revolutionized porn.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T14:18:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mightyoak11111", "comment_text": "The problen with many teachers today is that they now have political agendas and try to force those agendas onto their students.

This is called &quot;The Fallacy Of Division&quot;. (Look it up in Wikipedia.) Different media are better for different subjects and topics! Eg: Books for psychology and philosophy, books + video reenactments for history, live lectures with blackboards and a teacher to answer questions for mathematics, books + teachers for science, books + videos for technology, teachers giving live pronunciation demonstrations and explanations for languages, etc, etc, etc. In short: whatever works, and that is <i>not</i> the same for all subjects and topics. <br><br>Furthermore, human teachers are usually <i>not</i> necessary for most people to learn most things, especially at the college level. It&#39;s been noted by many that one can gain the equivalent of a $50,000 college education by just reading books in libraries for a total cost of $2 in late fees. No $50,000 debt hovering over one&#39;s head for the next 50 years that way. Colleges and universities are for the rich. If you&#39;re not rich, libraries and The Internet and home study are a <i>much</i> better option. <br><br>And, re &quot;on-screen text interferes with visuals&quot;, that is only true for people who haven&#39;t learned where the &quot;pause&quot; button is. :-) Those of use who <i>do</i> know where our pause button is, use it relentlessly in YouTube videos such as Ted talks which use a lot of printed text, charts, or graphics in their videos. Or, if the printed text is in the form of &quot;closed captions&quot;, and if it just mirrors what&#39;s being said in the audio, and if we can understand the audio, we just turn the closed captions off. Not because it &quot;interferes&quot; with anything, but because it&#39;s unnecessary and distracting. <br><br>And in real life, most teachers don&#39;t &quot;inspire students to want to learn&quot;, nor do they the opposite, &quot;make students accountable&quot; (well, maybe in military and religious schools, where corporal punishment is still used). No, most teachers in real life just convey information. I&#39;ve only had about 5 teachers <i>in my entire life</i> who break out of that mold and actually inspired me.

About half of the people you meet will be introverts.

Consider this thought experiment: What other human (non-biological) activities pioneered hundreds of years ago were done so perfectly that there is virtually no room for improvement? <br>3. Perhaps the folks who attempted to implement new tech for education failed because their actual understanding of education didn&#39;t advance. A better basketball doesn&#39;t necessarily make every free throw shooter a better shot.  How did the researchers measure learning? An old fashioned test? hmmm. Put another way, imagine how someone who had only ever been taught with a computing device on their classroom desk design next generation education when they are 20. <br>4. Someone promoting something makes predictions. Believing the prediction of something that&#39;s never happened before is a promise is even more foolish than believing the prediction will come to pass. <br>5. The same people who teach, believe and peddle VARC, tested new tech  ( See &quot;You are not a visual learner&quot;)<br>6. Almost none of the tech mentioned was created for the sole purpose of improving education.

If you tripled the salary of new teachers, you&#39;d have a much higher grade of people go for teaching jobs. People who would have gotten jobs elsewhere. Instead, teaching is relegated to a &quot;calling,&quot; much like nursing, so they get away with underpaying everyone. No teacher is going to go into a classroom every day, put up with the stresses and workload, for the measly pay they get right now, unless they are <i>really</i> into teaching or have no other choice. What&#39;s the phase? &quot;People who can, do, people who can&#39;t, teach.&quot; Why is that a saying? Because teaching is seen as a job you get if you can&#39;t do anything else. The fact that that is what the next generations of young minds are faced with when they are growing up is a <i>gigantic</i> failure of modern society.

None of these technologies have any such feedback, including youtube videos, have any such feedback.

This can also be done with paper media - remember &quot;programmed learning&quot; books? I suspect any true revolution in education will take this form, but I don&#39;t see much institutional desire to develop any such programs, outside a very few programs (I believe the NY school board ran an experiment in tailoring programs to the individual students, using multiple educational modes and constant monitoring to adjust if the chosen program was not benefiting the student) and possibly the adult education industry where competition and economics forces don&#39;t allow compacency.", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T17:05:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wedchidna oK", "comment_text": "MOOCs did revolutionize my education.<br>As did interning on an university, before that; and after that, having my meal-money stolen and physical entrance to local library barred.<br>Some revolutions are better than others.", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T02:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J V", "comment_text": "I think the first thing that a student needs to learn starting at the 1st grade is how to behave in a world of sugar coated and lies and trickery, is to bring about the truth in life, slowly and learn how to become independent.

I just left school last year and am now studying physics, and i already notice in hindsight how much i hated school from the fifth grade up. It started in prime school or whatever the first to forth grade are called in the US, I don\u2019t really know since I\u2019m from germany. I wasn\u2019t particularly good in school, but I had a nice teacher that always told me that that was ok and that she saw a lot of potential in me, especially when i didn\u2019t see anything. That enden on entering fifth grade, I was extremely stressed, felt completely overwhelmed and grossly inkompetent. Over the following five years or so i beat my self up so hard and eventually managed to become pretty good at school. In hindsight i only ever got better when I discovered a way to become better, that was compatible to my personality, like trying to find the weak spot in how the tests were created by the teachers, which first led me to understand what exactly the teachers were even trying to get from me. But even after becoming good in school I didn\u2019t feel good. Sure it is better than having bad grades, since everyone doesn\u2019t treat you like a failure, but it also comes with plenty of unpleasantries, for example the expectations of other people to be good at everything, the fear of not being good enough in the next exam, the shame that came every time i was expected to understand something, but didn\u2019t  etc. I really really hate it, but I\u2019m also pretty emotional right now, so I would normally not be quite so harsh, but the fact remains that school is a dumb institution. I also have started to hate the idea of judging people by \u201cIntelligence\u201d, since it really doesn\u2019t have to mean sh** . An intelligent person can be a terrible person, an person with bad grades can be a nice and otherwise gifted person. While i speak of it, its really not good at all to judge people in their grades, their apparent \u201cintelligence\u201d or even on gifts and talents, especially young people, who simply hadn\u2019t even hat the time to discover their interests or accomplish anything substantial. I mean does anyone even realize what  it does to children or teenagers, who don\u2019t yet know very much about the world, their interests or their talents and therefore don\u2019t yet have any self esteem to be judged only by grades? The ones that are good in school likely gain a high self esteem and feel superior, while the majority never develops any self esteem, because they don\u2019t know that it can be build on anything but consistent good grades.

This is the method that is least successful and which works for the lowest percentage of students.

With technology, you can enable those rare &quot;super-teachers&quot; to reach many more people than they otherwise could, and let average teachers focus on being supportive tutors when technology and social interaction isn&#39;t sufficient.

I am very interested in education and how the traditional process can be improved. Over my recent university years I have made some observations:<br>1.) MOOCs are great, but they miss human contact. It is kinda studying alone. I cannot talk about the stuff with classmates as I would normally would. Also if I dont understand something I cannot interrupt the teacher at the moment and ask him to explain something more or to challenge his proposed ideas.<br>2.) I think we should combine videos/reading for transferring the information and then just be in class to discuss these things or solve some problems - use the classroom for its most valuable things it offer - dialogue, immediacy.<br>3.) People wanna do courses from scratch. There has been a lot of things done already. Teaching a language? Let people learn the vocabulary with <a href=\"http://memrise.com\">memrise.com</a>. Teaching algorithms? Tell students to watch MIT OCW video about the topic before the class. Dont write your own Linear algebra book, let them use the famous Introduction to LA written by Gilbert Strang.<br>4.) Education should be about creativity, finding new ways to approach things, experiments, yet, teachers and school are extremely rigid and unwilling to change or modify the system if a new things is proposed.<br>5.) People should not be told things (such as A^2=B^2+C^2) - people should be given problems and understand why we want to solve it first. How would a worker figure out whether he has a right angle between 2 walls he built (Pythagorean theorem)? Why should I write readable code? Give students task to program something and then another task to modify it and them tell them to modify example well designed code. They will understand that rewriting their ugly code for hours was wasted effort.<br>6.) I miss learning by doing. Sometimes the best way to learn something is not by studying it in the first place, but by doing that when doing something else. Lets say TEX - teach people it and they might forget. Give them a chance to get bonus points for writing linear algebra HW in TEX starting from simple things and they will appreciate that.<br>7.) peer reviews are great - do work and then evaluate the same task of someone else (or also your own as well).<br>8.) I think it has been written at multiple places - when a test or HW is done, people should see the results/correct solution ASAP so they still remember what they have done. Exams are not for evaluation, but also crucial for learning itself. Checking my quiz a week after I wrote it and I have no idea why I have written the things I have.<br>9.)

(No I am not suggesting to kick out all teachers). A can mention a couple of things that go wrong in the classroom (most of the time)<br><br>1. Competition<br>  a. I know some schools do this but there are certinaly others that don&#39;t. I think competition is a really important thing when it comes to education. Because when competing it inspires you to try to out think your opponent and there is a goal to a competition unlike when just sitting on a chair listening to someone wondering what is the point.<br><br>2. Method of explanation<br> a. This is where usually most things go wrong. What I notice in schools (especially in America and in Math) is that the approach that they use to teach you is way too &quot;childish&quot;. They try to hold your hand and show you each and every step on a test you just answer everything mainly from memory. When teaching someone you have to make sure they are curios, now I am a highschool freshmen and I have never been in a class teaching a group of kids, but that is the way I prefer to be taught. But one very common example in math class is when they give you an equation. For example the equation &quot;A^2 + B^2 = C^2&quot;, imagine you are in a class, re-learning the equation. And this is how the teacher intrudeces this to you. &quot;Today we are gonna learn about how you can figure the hypotenuse of a right triangle. To do this you put one leg in A and the other in B then you square them and add them. Then you find the square root of C. Here is a handout then you have a quiz&quot; To me that sounds like the teacher missed many opportunities. The teacher could have given proof of the equation, who made, why was it made, how was it made, ect... Instead he just introduced as a straight forward thing and that is just boring and gives no curisosty or wonders.<br><br>These are my thoughts on teachers I tried to keep it short....mostly becuase I am in a hurry to watch all the other videos veritasium...", "comment_date": "2017-04-18T18:49:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "inertiaforce", "comment_text": "Veritasium, it was your videos on inertia and gravity that got me interested in the subject to study it on my own and got me to choose this name on Youtube.", "comment_date": "2017-04-18T02:27:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Lee", "comment_text": "AI will revolutionize education.

But even then, the mistake is in the student&#39;s head. No amount of analytics in the world can change that without solid research on how to overturn misconceptions and mental errors.

The enthusiasm that I heard in their voice as they told me how they figured it out made them feel so happy and smart. On top of all of this, they would remember their finding so well that they would never ask me the same question twice. They more I did this type of training, the better they were at figuring things out and also they would get really good at explaining how things work within the software application.

The issue is insufficient motivation. You hinted that it is the teacher\u2019s job to engage the students and to make learning fun and interesting, but there is one fundamental aspect to our system that no teacher can change or address: Education is compulsory. All students are expected to complete certain curricula, whether they want to or not. Whether they\u2019re interested or not. Whether they\u2019d rather learn something else that\u2019s not on the curriculum or not.

I can&#39;t tell you the number of times I heard &quot;That&#39;s true but we&#39;re not going into it because it&#39;s not on the exam&quot;. I can only go off England because my experience of education so far has just been here but I&#39;ll use my example. When I was 11 I went to the best school in the area and I was put in the middle group set which was given the letter F and we were always told H was the top set for the most intelligent kids. So from day 1 you&#39;re given a catagory of what they say you&#39;re capable of, this comes down to what exams you&#39;re entered into and what grades you&#39;ll achieve. So I had some teachers tell me I&#39;d not be going to college (here we go to college at 16 then University at 18-19) and one in particular told me I&#39;d never amount to much and several when I asked about University told me I&#39;d never make it there but other students in the top set would go. So I made it to college and there it was the same again the &quot;It&#39;s not on the exam paper&quot; answer and again the frustration and annoyance set in, again told I&#39;d not go to university and I&#39;d not get to do what I wanted to do and again I felt I had to start to accept that. So after college I made it to university and I did my degree in Biomedical Sciences and this is where the change occured, because I was not once told at university &quot;It&#39;s not on the exam&quot; or not to explore a particular idea I was always encouraged to do so and from there I went from strength to strength, finished by degree with one of the highest marks attainable and now I&#39;m all lined up to do a masters with ties to a PhD afterwards. I often wonder what might have happened if I had a teacher to encourage me along through school and in college to push me that little bit and tell me to go and explore my ideas and go forward, to have open discussions in class rather than &quot;the text book says, it will be on the exam&quot; I think that could make all the difference in the world.", "comment_date": "2016-10-22T08:33:46Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Oliver Morland", "comment_text": "I agree with your point.

Technology in education plays an important role in the study habits and skills of your child. But, you need to make sure that you are going to be very careful in allowing them to use their computer and surf the internet for them to avoid discovering things that are not part of their studies.

When we use text, email and voice mail as a substitute for face to face communication, we do not communicate at the level of in-depth understanding and shared commitment. Not communicating face to face limits our effectiveness and the ability to effect results. When we are not face to face we miss tones, inflections and non-verbal cues. Good communication requires good listening skills and goes well beyond hearing what is said. Empathy requires active listening and is all about asking questions to probe and clarify the information you have heard and to delve into unspoken areas. We cannot do this with technology. Without face to face interaction we cannot have in-depth give and take to fully expand our ideas.<br>The highest value of effective communications is the ability to develop best thinking by drawing on the full talents, experience and education of all employees.

The reason is precisely because of the overwhelming amounts of uncaring teachers, non feeling or thinking classroom environments, and learning that is delivered at a pace that some students think is too fast or too slow. Also making comparisons about technology 70 years ago to today is a pure fallacy. Methodologies like those of Khan Academy are proving that education can indeed be done more effectively. I am not going to debate the semantics of evolution and revolution - the idea remains the same - Education needs to be reformed and the way in which information needs to be designed/repackaged and delivered to students needs to be reformed. I don&#39;t disagree about the social aspects that you mentioned as it is true students may need a social setting too BUT this is a subject specific comment - For example Social studies, debating and Public speaking classes do require a social setting due to their nature however learning subjects like Math or Geography may be done individually on one&#39;s own time given that one student may need more time to grasp the subject than another and by virtue of their social setting one student will succeed and the other will fail. Therefore the introduction of video based electronic learning IS a way to transform education because it satisfies the idea of self paced learning while still keeping the door open for social (perhaps not face to face but social nevertheless) interactions. Classes (or Videos On YOUTUBE) like Crash Course illustrate a perfect example of video based learning WITH A TEACHER who is entertaining and inspiring. Bottom line to make learning a success for the 21st century we have to seriously look at the faults of existing learning design and delivery and ask how we can update them to help students of the future be inspired and motivated not only to learn but ultimately to assist them to discover themselves and their passion and inspiration and frankly education in its current state is simply not doing enough of that.

Certainly, when the first motion pictures came out, the cost to produce a short clip, let alone one centered around an educational topic, would have been astronomical. The costs would have far outweighed the benefits. This probably held true up until the time when specific topics were covered in video format (in large part through the direct involvement of large production companies and educational channels funded by the government) - i.e. via the good old VHS tapes we used to watch as kids in school. For me, this was Bill Nye The Science Guy videos. However, these videos were more demonstrative rather than diagnostic - so students would watch, but could not engage/get &quot;hands on&quot;/learn by trial-and-error. But given the ubiquity of YouTube and the low cost to entry, the truly transformative aspect is the platform, not necessarily the videos, which provides educators a medium to structure content, and for learners to absorb this content in their own pace (good example - KhanAcademy). Again, key here is structure - there&#39;s a progression of learning that takes place with KhanAcademy. With other education channels - like yours, SciShow, VSauce, CGP Grey - the videos are more discovery-based. The topics are more sporadic and the content is geared towards explaining a certain phenomenon. It&#39;s more &quot;hey - here&#39;s a cool thing we found that we think you&#39;ll like to hear about&quot;, rather than &quot;hey - here&#39;s Biology Lesson #1&quot;.

I&#39;m a lifelong learner and I&#39;ve done industrial design of electronics and taught electronics in the classroom setting to novice would-be technicians. I&#39;ve mastered countless other physical and mental skills as well, from music to medical technician. I recall when I was four or five wanting to be a scientist when I barely knew what to call it. Everything I saw I remembered and it all looked obvious to me. When I went to school I always seemed to learn everything shown to me first time, and never had to be shown again. This while I saw other kids struggling around me. I noted that while I always believed I could learn anything, and that excited me, that they didn&#39;t believe that about themselves, and were consequently uninterested, except to get teachers and parents off their backs. This continued into high school and so on. There were always a small number for whom science was all they ever wanted to do, and the rest who never seemed to know what they wanted to do in life except find a way to keep people in authority from bothering them to learn and find a way to get rich quick so they didn&#39;t have to learn anything. Scientists are people who would do science even if they couldn&#39;t find a way to be paid for it. They approach everything in life as an experiment and it fascinates them. They can&#39;t picture doing without that in their life, even if they had to do it for free. The rest seem to live on the outside of things, and they can&#39;t figure out what to do with themselves and try to find happiness with formulaic antidotes to boredom, sports, marriage, family, parties, and other distractions that bored people like me. And if you try to teach them things they can&#39;t remember them for more than five minutes. These are the people who are always calling their friends up to &quot;fix&quot; their computer when they screw it up. These are the folks who get gypped by their mechanic because they never bothered to find out how engines work or what is what in gasoline vehicles. They seem quite sad to me, really, they have NO confidence that they can learn, and that lack dates back to before they even went to school. I&#39;m not sure if it comes from the way their parents talked to them, or didn&#39;t, or the way they first apprehended the tiniest lessons in the way the world works not long after birth. My impression is that it is a fool&#39;s errand to try to teach these folks, they will not learn, they have a mental block against it, and no strategy, no new teaching medium, or any such new method will enable them to believe they can learn. And of course people lose interest in things that totally stymie them. I am beginning to believe this may be inherited, and that it may have something to do with the complement of genes and their behaviors which we inherited from our forebears, and the distribution of some very special genetic features in a small percentage of the population. Whatever it is, it is inherited unevenly throughout the human population, and there appears to be some Gaussian distribution of these abilities in our population genome that will ever prevent many people from achieving that kind of facility with ideas. As an inveterate teacher I hate that thought, but as I grow older it seems more and more to be the obvious reason why we struggle in vain to teach many or most students.", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T23:28:29Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "kinsel", "comment_text": "We need to be looking from the inside-out, not the outside-in of the student.", "comment_date": "2016-01-22T14:01:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XxBio-HazardxX", "comment_text": "I prefer reading something than listening to something.

Yes, the field engaged in decades of media comparison studies, but only to learn the affects of new types of technology on learning - definitive information we would not have without such studies - not to make bold claims that technology would always revolutionize education (or, rather, &quot;schooling&quot; as is actually depicted). This is simply not a statement that serious researchers in this field make. Such exaggerated predictions tend to emanate from disassociated sources (Edison did not, himself, conduct empirical research on instructional technology integration that I am aware of.). The scholarly field of instructional technology research also is rooted in the foundations of psychology, sociology, and other sciences that embrace the essence of the final point you made in your video.

Despite, arguably, initial leanings toward strict behaviorism, much of it has responsibly attended to the benefits of social interaction, paying homage to the likes of Vygotsky, Dewey, Du Bois, etc. This video, however, strings together a series of points about research strands not directly related to each other over the historical expanse of the field, painting an overall inaccurate, and certainly incomplete, picture. It has never been correct to assume that technology would &quot;revolutionize&quot; education, and I have never heard a contemporary instructional technology researcher say that he or she thought that it could (with the obvious caveat that no one can fully know what all future technologies may be).", "comment_date": "2016-01-16T04:12:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azza Nine", "comment_text": "A teacher is supposed to instill the importance of education.

Static graphics are certainly better at promoting memorization of processes (thinking of that heart animation and the graphics) because they require the student to animate the pictures in their own heads, thereby reinforcing specific synaptic connections, but before a student can memorize a process, she/he must grasp it first. This is where animations can be necessary. A person cannot imagine processes she/he has not seen/experienced anything like before (think of Piaget&#39;s experiment that involves young children learning about liquid volume characteristics in containers, or a child learning the sound of a musical scale). She/he must see it or something like it to intuit it, and then at that point a student could pause to think about it or look at static graphics and recreate the animations in her/his own head to reinforce memorization. It could be considered this way: demonstration first for understanding, and practice afterward for reinforcing (there are many parts to learning, and memorization is one of the most basic parts, if not the most). To sum up my point, I think it is sometimes best for a student to see an animation AND static graphics, in that order. Also, if the animation could be paused/replayed, just as a music teacher could play a passage of music multiple times, more slowly, or even just certain parts of the musical passage, that would be beneficial.

Evolution will have insured this, because a parent who would take it&#39;s offspring everywhere would be limited in terms of speed and stealth, (the key to hunting, or gathering in safety), therefore both would perish. A parent who just left their offspring for significant amounts of time would lead to the offspring harming itself or be harmed. Limiting ones movements to within one&#39;s offspring&#39;s vicinity would greatly limit the availability of food.

All graphics and videos are BS. Take your basically teaching of psychology of learning and teaching, then pedagogy methods and finally the most important is a use of DIDACTIC as a science of teaching the children in the school or students at the college. Yes, and it needs to start very, very slowly, because it is the only way to attract the attention of the students who are dreamy early in the morning. The talking about a video or graphic presentation make a sense only when student start to be awaken and as psychologists said students have maximum concentration in the morning between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEmuEWjHr5c&amp;t=8m40s\">8:40</a> AM to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEmuEWjHr5c&amp;t=10m00s\">10:00</a> AM.

Only way to solve this is to stop basing education financing on property taxes. This is inherently wrong anyway.

For example, your videos are always about one topic matter. It would be unrealistic and hyperbolic to ask you to upload a video about the entirety of physics. Once we start to have conversations about each medium&#39;s time and place, we can start fine tuning them to their appropriate function.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the revolution will come from any technology, whether it be a book or a holodeck. This line of thinking never bothers to address the learner&#39;s agency in their own education. I think the revolution will be a shift in attitudes and practices. I absolutely agree with you that teachers are guides; people who inspire and challenge. But a challenge requires a participant. I imagine a world where people recognize what media they need at what specific moments in their learning, and seek to extract information where ever they can. We would see a different world if systems existed to facilitate individuals mobilizing themselves into a modern education; as opposed to waiting for the revolutionary technology to come along.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>P.S.

All of the teaching assistants were provided with a spreadsheet feedback form that we were to provide to each student for their initial and final writing assignments over the semester. For each line item on the form, we were to assign a score on a 3-point rating scale - poor, average, or excellent. The spreadsheet was designed to generate a score based on these ratings, which were weighted by line item, but a student who scored average on every line item would still end up with a score of 50% - a failing grade.<br><br>The teaching assistants weren&#39;t required to use this score to assign a grade, but I felt it was the most objective way to go about it and would best reflect how I felt the student had performed overall, so I restructured it to a 5-point scale and re-weighted the levels to more closely reflect the A-F grading system the university used, so that a student who scored average on all the items would actually get an average grade. I also tried to make comments where I could to let students know specific things they could have done differently or areas where they could improve, and I always made it clear that they should contact me if they had any questions about the materials. The number one need that I saw was for them to develop good critical thinking skills, and I worked at getting them to develop those skills.<br><br>After the semester was over and the results of the experiment were tabulated, I was told that my students had shown the most improvement in their scores of any of the participating lab sections. I&#39;ve always felt that their performance was a reflection of the level of engagement I tried to encourage in them, and I&#39;ve always believed that the teacher&#39;s most important task is to get students to move beyond rote memorization and to learn to think critically for themselves and make life itself a learning process.

If I may tick off (and paraphrase) some of your points:<br>- Technology by itself will never revolutionize education. It can enhance\u00a0the experience\u00a0by bringing more information in more varied forms into the classroom, ultimately appealing to an increasing range of learning styles, but that&#39;s about it.<br>- Anything extraneous needs to be eliminated from a lesson: simply put -\u00a0remove distractions. I agree!\u00a0But this concept has to extend beyond unnecessary content in the learning materials. This is where the fundamental changes have to happen. The student for whom the lesson moves too slowly will get bored and turn\u00a0their attention to other things. Similarly, the student for whom the lesson moves too quickly will eventually stop listening, get bored and turn\u00a0their attention to other things. These are distractions, i.e. extraneous activities.<br>- YES teachers in their current incarnation are obsolete...and they have been for about 100 years! Nuff said.<br><br>What some of these new schools are doing is decentralized, self-paced learning. Sort of like Khan, but I don&#39;t mean to say everyone should just watch YouTube videos at home and expect a well-rounded education. There are very important social aspects to learning as well - especially for younger students. (By the way, nothing against Kahn. I think they are a great learning resource.)<br><br>Keeping a student engaged and excited about learning is the real trick, and THAT is the most important thing the teacher can provide. The information\u00a0they convey is secondary, and can be gotten almost anywhere. The teacher&#39;s primary job should be to teach a student how to learn, remove roadblocks, and provide guidance and encouragement.<br><br>We really need to drag ourselves out of the dark ages. Traditional education was developed as a controlled way to cram fundamental concepts into the children of an un-enlightened society so they could grow up to be unenlightened factory workers or fodder for the war machine (OK so I&#39;m being a bit dramatic). But we&#39;ve changed so much as a society, and yet we continue to use an archaic and ineffective system of education even though we know better. And I think we are doing an injustice especially to the young students at a time when they have so much potential; and because of our schools many of them are never realizing that potential.<br><br><b>Gets down off the soap box</b>", "comment_date": "2015-01-24T06:10:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Majestic Orangutan", "comment_text": " When i read the title i had one word stuck in my head &#39;edumacation&#39;...the whole video i was wondering &#39;does he polish his forehead&#39;...that shows how intelligent i am...", "comment_date": "2015-01-23T11:16:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_ Cesar _", "comment_text": "I hope you all saw what I saw.<br>What I saw was a man speaking into a camera.

I&#39;ve found and am coming to appreciate that teachers who can do this root themselves in my mind and inspire me. My physics teacher tells me he knows I have the capacity to do well, which motivates me far more than a bad grade ever could.", "comment_date": "2014-12-26T04:30:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antti Laakkonen", "comment_text": "smartboards are in every single classroom in finland you know...", "comment_date": "2014-12-25T21:16:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DrugsForRobots", "comment_text": "An excerpt from Teaching As A Subversive Activity by Neil Postman &amp; Charles Weingartner (1969):<br><br>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>What all of us have learned (and how difficult is it to unlearn) is that it is not important that our utterances satisfy the demands of the question (or of reality), but that they satisfy the demands of the classroom environment. Teacher asks. Student answers. Have you ever heard of a student who replied to a question, &#39;Does anyone know the answer to that question?&#39; or &#39;I don&#39;t understand what I would have to do in order to find an answer&#39;, or &#39;I have been asked that question before and, frankly, I&#39;ve never understood what it meant?&#39; Such behavior would invariably result in some form of penalty and is, of course, scrupulously avoided, except by &#39;wise guys&#39;. Thus students learn not to value it. They get the message. And yet few teachers consciously articulate such a message. It is not part of the &#39;content&#39; of their instruction. No teacher ever said: &#39;Don&#39;t value uncertainty and tentativeness. Don&#39;t question questions. Above all, don&#39;t think.&#39; The message is communicated quietly, insidiously, relentlessly, and effectively through the structure of the classroom: through the role of the teacher, the role of the student, the rules of their verbal game, the rights that are assigned, the arrangements made for communication, the &#39;doings&#39; that are praised or censured.&quot;<br><br>Have you ever heard of a student taking notes on the remarks of another student? Probably not. Because the organization of the classroom makes it clear that what students say is not the &#39;content&#39; of instruction. Therefore, it will not be included on tests. Therefore, they can ignore it.<br><br>Have you ever heard of a student indicating an interest in how a textbook writer arrived at his conclusions? Rarely, we would guess. Most students are unaware that textbooks are written by human beings. Besides, the classroom structure does not suggest that the process of inquiry are of any importance.<br><br>Have you ever heard of a student suggesting a more useful definition of something that the teacher has already defined? Or of a student who asked, &#39;Whose facts are those?&#39; Or of a student who asked, &#39;What is a fact?&#39; Or of a student who asked, &#39;Why are we doing this work?&#39;<br><br>Now if you reflect on the fact that most classroom environments are managed so that such questions as these will not be asked, you can become very depressed. Consider, for example, where &#39;knowledge&#39; comes from. It isn&#39;t just there in a book waiting for someone to come along and &#39;learn&#39; it. Knowledge is produced in response to questions. And new knowledge results from the asking of new questions; quite often new questions about old questions. Here is the point: once you have learned to ask questions - relevant and appropriate and substantial questions - you have learned how to learn and no one can keep you from learning whatever you want or need to know. Let us remind you, for a moment, of the process that characterizes school environments: what students are restricted to (solely and even vengefully) is the process of memorizing (partially and temporarily) somebody else&#39;s answers to somebody else&#39;s questions. It is staggering to consider the implications of this fact. The most important and intellectual ability man has yet developed - the art and science of asking questions - is not taught in school! Moreover, it is not &#39;taught&#39; in the most devastating way possible: by arranging the environment so that significant question asking is not valued. It is doubtful if you can think of many schools that include question asking, or methods of inquiry, as part of their curriculum. But even if you knew a hundred that did, there would be little cause for celebration unless the classrooms were arranged so that students could do question asking; not talk about it, read about it, be told about it. Asking questions is behavior. If you don&#39;t do it, you don&#39;t learn it. It really is that simple.&quot;&quot;&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-12-25T16:04:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake Kim", "comment_text": "i sub yesturday. i also love education", "comment_date": "2014-12-25T14:27:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pakin Pongcheewin", "comment_text": "please share this to every teachers Q^Q\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-12-25T06:00:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mike clasener", "comment_text": "Great video, one of your best!

Usually I find that our teachers are constantly struggling with the smart boards as they are not very technically inclined. In my physics 30 class I am about to finish I am constantly helping my teacher use his smart board as he is very interested in utilizing it better. Needless to say as a physics teacher he caught on very quickly (if only I could do the same with physics) and is improving the way he is teaching his class by changing and adapting his presentations to better suit his new knowledge. I have attempted to help many of my other teachers however none of them have been interested in adapting, which in my opinion is a serious problem as many of \u00a0them use the smart board as a regular projector. I believe that if the teachers were actually trained to use the smart boards they could really improve their courses and the way that its taught for the better.

Nowadays, teachers are trying to evoke that once lost passion; but still, most methods of teaching still rely on memorization, without letting the students learn things hands-on.

Now in two of my courses (Math 541 and Econ 521) the professors have openly acknowledged the fact that in class they can&#39;t cover all the material that will be on exams and that you will have to copious amounts of work outside the lecture just to be introduced to some of the material. There is no time left for tangents that spark the brain and make the subject interesting and make you want to learn more. Do I think that is the right way to do things, absolutely not, and you could say that those professors are doing it completely wrong in the mindset that that isn&#39;t the proper way to fully activate learning. But if you say that, then you don&#39;t need a new teacher, those teachers I have are very good, but you need a new curriculum and a new education system that allows for that.<br><br>And also I have to say on the basis of technology being able to allow for better learning, I agree much more with CPG Grey on it being possible. I don&#39;t question your research on video vs textbook, and animation vs static images, or anything like that, but if you compiled a system that allows you to choose if you want to read, or if you want to listen/watch, or do both if you like. And each student chose how they feel they best learn, and were presented with much more information on a subject than a teacher could ever know or remember on the spot, I very very much feel that system would by far exceed the current educational system we currently have.<br><br>Personally, there have been some classes where I have gone to the first day of class, never gone again, spent no more than 2hrs a week during a regular week studying that class, and gotten A&#39;s, in beginning and advanced courses. I am a Math/Econ double, and in my advanced classes both majors use mathematical notation, and I have found that each professor in each course and especially between majors has their own quirks about how they use the notation, and I find if I go to class it only confuses me (like learning 3 similar but separate languages instead of 1) and I much rather learn out of a textbook that is standard throughout every course than from the teacher.<br><br>Lastly I do agree that school is easily the most important part in socially developing each and every one of us. That can&#39;t be understated in my mind, so especially up to high school I feel like the system should stay. But maybe starting in high school, and definitely being utilized in college I feel like these &quot;digital Aristotle&#39;s&quot; could be used to cut down college costs, maybe making half the courses through this technology. And I know this sounds like killing colleges, but all my professors are more focused on their research anyways, that is what they are truly there for, this would make colleges even more the hub of developing new research and innovation. Also with these digital Aristotle&#39;s and potentially more time, students could focus more on their upcoming careers, getting more part time jobs etc, and this could lead to people who have been part of their job at an earlier age and people who are most likely much better at their job, bettering society that way as well.\u00a0<br><br>Just my thoughts, know it was a lot @Veritasium\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-12-09T08:04:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrYeshaav", "comment_text": "Can you provide links to the different studies mentioned in the description?", "comment_date": "2014-12-09T06:42:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Jones", "comment_text": "Congrats on 2M<br>By the way, video disks were vinyl, like LP records, but they were super thick.

I think the answer still lies with the educational bureaucracy.<br><br>It&#39;s not that bureaucracy is slow to make a change, per se. It would be irresponsible for all classrooms everywhere to make the switch from the present nearly uniform format to a radically different, but still uniform format.<br><br>The first harm that bureaus present is that they hinder experimentation and innovation in the classroom. With the presence of federal and state standards requiring certain educational tools or methods, teachers hands are tied. They become unable to meet the individual needs and learning styles of their students. In some cases, they are punished for trying to find better ways to educate kids.<br><br>The second harm is that the present system takes power out of the hands of parents and puts it into the hands of professional educators. Since school administrators are paid from the top down, they have every incentive to listen to their supervisors while ignoring parents. Wealthy and middle class students may have some choice because their parents can afford to move to a town with better schools or take the financial hit and pay for private school as well as the taxes that go to public school. However, the poor do not have these luxuries. Poor parents have no bargaining power because they can&#39;t afford to move their kids.

It&#39;s easy to get confused or demotivated by having access to &quot;a bunch of stuff&quot; but with no guidance nor clear expectation. You talk about inspiring students. Yes, that&#39;s great, but to me what that really breaks down to is motivation. The teacher should be someone who knows better how to go about learning than the student. Some students need more teaching than others. So yes, more personal attention will produce better outcomes, respecting the fact that being part of a group movement is also a strong motivator. Also, about methods, the method used to learn something depends on what is being learned. I can learn computer programming quite differently than I learn a foreign language.

Others may use a combination of all methods and still be confused - so requiring the teacher to break down the information into an easier-to-access format (e.g. simpler language, one sentence at a time). With skills-based courses, another learning style opens up: kinaesthetic (i.e. actually doing it).<br><br>A successful teacher blends as many learning styles into their lesson as possible, in order to reach out to as many pupils/students as possible. Informing the pupils/students of the learning objectives and outcomes is also useful - many teachers in the UK (particularly in primary) are encouraged to share WALT / WILF at the start of the lesson: We Are Learning To... / What I&#39;m Looking For.<br><br>In addition to catering to the various learning styles, successful teachers also blend in something called differentiation - even when classes are divided into ability/attainment sets, there&#39;ll be a wide spread of &quot;intelligence&quot; (for want of a better word) within the group. Some will grasp the concepts instantly, others will need them repeated / broken down, others will need to be taught in smaller groups or even 1:1. Another part of differentiation is coping with the fact different pupils will progress through the task at different rates - so setting extension tasks for those who complete early.<br><br>If that wasn&#39;t enough, teachers also have to be able to prepare at short notice a written form of the lesson that can be distributed to pupils who aren&#39;t in class (e.g. ill, pregnant, on an in-school suspension, excluded).<br><br>Ofsted (the UK government&#39;s Office for Standards in Education) carry out regular inspections of schools and also like teachers to be able to tell an inspector a pupil&#39;s progress both within the lesson and course.<br><br>Then once you&#39;ve been able to cope with that, you throw behaviour and behaviour policies into the mix. Disruptive pupils have to be dealt with inside the classroom - it&#39;s no longer acceptable to get them to stand outside the door. A typical behaviour policy has a list of sanctions that start off with verbal warnings, then relocating within the classroom (if possible), then migrating onto lunchtime detention (in the school I taught, practically useless as they stood in the school hall facing the wall for half an hour) and eventually after school detention (only with the consent of the Head of Year), in-school suspension (typically they took their lessons with other suspendees in a spare classroom supervised by teaching assistants - often they&#39;d produce great work in that environment, separated from their peers, but as soon as they were back in the classroom...) and eventually fixed period exclusion.<br><br>Secondary schools provide teachers with some &quot;free&quot; periods per week (ostensibly to give them a bit of in-school time for planning, preparation and evaluation), but they&#39;re often eaten into by providing cover for absent teachers.<br><br>Factor in the extensive amounts of time required to plan and prepare lessons, plus mark all the pupils&#39; work (even for small classes of 20, with up to 6x 50 minute lessons per day, that&#39;s an awful lot of work to do after hours!), prepare reports and parents evenings etc. Then there&#39;s the pastoral side - if a teacher has a registration group, they have to produce a pastoral report for all those pupils and comment in parents evenings.<br><br>Once all the business of teaching is dealt with, there&#39;s government policy. The current government visualise 1950s Grammar Schools as utopia so seek to encourage schools to emulate that model. There&#39;s an increased emphasis on English, Maths and Science, with arts subjects increasingly sidelined, together with psychology, sociology and media studies (frequently criticised by compliant media sources as not real subjects that don&#39;t teach anything useful and their very existance is evidence that education and academia are infested with loony left liberals, who they claim also distribute &quot;prizes for all,&quot; refuse to ever label a child a failure and eliminate any form of inter- or intra- class competition [what planet are the media commentators living on?!]). To qualify for entry into the annual League Tables, a GCSE-level subject must have no modules or coursework and be assessed purely by an end-of-course written external examination (whether academic or vocational - since the latter have traditionally been skills-based courses assessed by coursework and/or modules, the courses have been substantially rewritten). Science practicals were only belatedly added to the science specification, but contribute no more than 10% of the mark. The National Curriculum has also been revised, with the History syllabus requiring pupils to be taught in strict chronological order as they progress through school (so 4 year olds will be taught about Ancient Britain [iron age etc.], progressing up to the World Wars by 15-16).<br><br>Despite claims to the contrary, the government (and compliant media) like schools to act as exam factories, introducing ever more tests to formally assess a pupil&#39;s achievement and progress (there&#39;s a short test to assess what they know within a couple of weeks of arriving at school at 4-5, a &quot;phonics check&quot; at age 6 to determine whether they&#39;ve mastered synthetic phonics [the test even including a handful of made-up words to determine whether pupils are really using phonics to form words or have just memorised a large vocabulary]), Key Stage 1 SATs at 7, Key Stage 2 at 11, Key Stage 3 at 13, GCSEs at 16, &#39;A&#39; Levels at 18). Ofsted inspections are heavily geared towards &quot;teaching and learning&quot; with little emphasis on ethos / environment / pastoral care, and the annual league tables are based purely on the pupils&#39; achievement. Although there is a &quot;value added&quot; measure which takes a pupil&#39;s performance within the first year of school, estimates what GCSE grades they&#39;d get if they progressed at the same rate, and assigned scores above 1,000 if they exceed expectations (interpreted as entirely due to the teacher&#39;s input) and scores below if they fall below expectations (interpreted as the teacher&#39;s fault); the tables are generally sorted by raw achievement (so you&#39;ll typically find academically selective schools at the top of the pile).", "comment_date": "2014-12-06T17:41:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evandro Lima", "comment_text": "TV shows like Cosmos with neil degrasse tyson should be a parte of all childrens education.

It seems a little unclear as to what is meant by a &#39;revolution in education.&#39; The video seems too broad and ambiguous as a result.\u00a0<br><br>The term revolution generally comes as a response to a fundamental problem(s). Such a problem is not clearly identified. In fact, I&#39;d go as far as saying that the term education itself should be better defined. Derick alludes to the problem when he talks about the turtle programming, whereby &#39;reasoning&#39; is not being invoked or when he says that the classroom dynamic of a teacher in front of a class of students hasn&#39;t changed as a result of technology. But the questions still remain as to what is meant by &#39;education&#39; and what is that which requires change.<br><br>There are plenty of theorists who discuss student learning and its processes, and depending on their background, each theorist provides a different perspective and points to problems in a certain area. For example, a sociologist would perhaps argue that education is not improving because of the flawed structures of educational institutions themselves in relation to the wider institutions of society, or that learning is a cultural phenomenon. A political philosopher would perhaps argue that education is another tool of power put in place to continue subservience in order to keep the hamster wheel turning and is not particularly designed to promote higher thinking. A psychologist may argue that students are subject to environmental stimuli and a lack of improvement in education is a result of such stimuli. Someone with a background in neuroscience may perhaps argue that learning is purely a biological phenomenon and we&#39;d need to understand the brain better before one could clearly say how to improve student learning (if student learning is the issue at hand).<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to sound like a hypocrite, I acknowledge that these examples are broad and also don&#39;t identify the problem nor define the term &#39;education.&#39; But I only point them out to illustrate the broadness of this topic with regards to academic inquiry. As a student of education, a number of names come to mind such as Skinner, Vygotsky, Erickson, Pyrgot, Bloom.. There are plenty more but they slip my mind at this point, and I may have misspelled their names. These theorists have at least had their work implemented as policy and are standard works to go by if one pursues this field (in Australia). And studies here have shown their work to be quite effective in comparison to past educational structures. And their work does not attempt to &#39;revolutionise&#39; education. Their work is implemented into the already existing classroom structure. It&#39;s the pedagogy that has changed - the teacher-student dynamic is at the heart of the issue. Although this requires the teacher to effectively utilise what they have supposedly learned and according to fellow students, this is much easier said than done.<br><br>That&#39;s why I think this video is rather unclear. Nonetheless, it provokes questions and thoughts and it&#39;s interesting to read the discussions here in the comments.<br><br>My personal opinion is that we barely understand intelligence itself. The vast range of opinions demonstrate this. I personally lean towards a more philosophical outlook on things, including education, and I tend to agree with certain readings in epistemology, so that&#39;s my bias.", "comment_date": "2014-12-05T08:26:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Jakob Heuser", "comment_text": "Awesome Video, awesome channel!!

I went to a K-8 school without grades, and upon reaching high-school, it seemed strange that of my peers were motivated so much by these weird little letters that started appearing at the tops of our assignments. As I\u2019ve observed both highschool students and younger students, I\u2019ve often wondered if the role grades play in our current system of education could be improved. I don\u2019t believe grades are inherently detrimental to learning, and they seem fairly necessary in a practical way, as they play a necessary role in determining which students can benefit from the limited resources that exist in higher education. However, one of the main issues I have with our current education system is how early teachers and parents assign getting good grades as the primary focus of school. This system implicitly treats learners as lazy and unmotivated, since it assumes that they can only be motivated to learn by arbitrary and superficial \u201crewards\u201d or measurements of success, rather than intellectual curiosity for what they\u2019re learning about. Because of these \u201crewards,\u201d I\u2019ve observed countless students begin to lose their original interest in their subjects and turn towards the immediate gratification from school, which is reinforced at home. I\u2019m not just talking about getting golden stars for reading books in Kindergarden\u2014this culture produces elementary-schoolers who work for A\u2019s to please their parents, high-schoolers who work to get into prestigious colleges, and college students who work only for the highest-paying degree.

I believe we&#39;re one step ahead of the problem in this though. In order for education to work, the person being educated has to want to be educated. It doesn&#39;t matter how you approach educating them if they will not -- or rather cannot -- apply their attention to learning. If you want to teach students you have to out-perform the other things that are competing for their attention. This is a fundamental rule and it applies to everyone. But go to a college -- even a reputable college -- and look at the majority of the people. If you live in America, you see that they don&#39;t want to dedicate their attention to studying or learning, they want to make friends and take snapchats and live the American dream.<br>A more prominent issue today lies in the types of people that are entering college. Improvement in technology has machines replacing low-skilled workers, and these low-skilled workers are forced to go into college in order to qualify for better jobs or else they remain unemployed. But for most the reason they are low-skilled is because they weren&#39;t able to get through school the first time around. When the majority of them fail to pass their classes, it appears to us that education isn&#39;t working. Many schools counteract this by simply lowering the grading standards in undergraduate classes, making it easier for these people to pass, get a diploma for general education, and then leave to get a job and pay off their loans. Thus we don&#39;t see a change in the grades and low-skill workers get to re-enter the job market. But making the problem transparent doesn&#39;t fix it -- technology is growing exponentially, and we can&#39;t simply repeat the process of sending these people that are no longer qualified to work back to college because we can&#39;t expect that a majority of them are going to get passed through each time, even with a grading curve. Moreover, the population of unskilled workers will be positively correlated to the exponential improvement in technology, so more and more people are being sent to college each time the patch is applied.", "comment_date": "2014-12-03T14:41:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J Khalaf", "comment_text": "Well said, loved it.", "comment_date": "2014-12-03T14:30:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "iguanian", "comment_text": "This video reminded me of an interview I did with Noel Justice at Indiana University, Bloomington back in the 90&#39;s.

Currently, teachers need to both be great at teaching and know their subject really well, and that combination is much rarer than just being great at teaching. That means many more possible great teachers, and a much higher quality of the information that students learn. (There&#39;s a big time gap between when some knowledge is discovered and when effective high-school teachers start teaching it.) Outcomes are limited by the product of the quality of the instruction and the quality of the information, and being able to optimize the two dimensions separately, rather than the teacher&#39;s time being split between presentation skills and material development, could have an enormous impact.<br><br>The other thing that might be revolutionary is being able to form a class online, such that students can be in a Skype chat with their class, instead of not having a class available at all. There could certainly be a revolution in terms of the portion of children who can participate interactively with a teacher and peers who are learning the same material. If education happens in a small group setting, a revolution in education would require a revolution in small group communication. You listed a lot of technologies that didn&#39;t do anything for that, but Twitch (for example) is all about a moderator leading a small group of participants who interact live with each other and the moderator despite not being in the same room. Certainly, we haven&#39;t got any new technologies that are as good as the best classroom, but we&#39;ve now got technologies that are better than many classrooms.

Not interested in my education whatsoever, but suddenly my interest for my education and future became substantially a joy and priority in my life when I got a new professor. This professor didn&#39;t really teach me much in his classes. He had a very engaging personality, and was able to spark my interest for new knowledge. As said in this video, the main purpose of a professor, teacher, etc, should be the one to spark interest, to challenge, to provoke, to stimulate the student&#39;s interest for learning. I believe this video focuses more about basic education, and correct me I am wrong please.\u00a0<br>One more personal experience was when I took my ESL-100. As you might tell by my writing, english is my second language, so I apologize if something disturbs your eyes.

It&#39;s true technology by itself cannot revolutionize education because the core of education (having someone motivate people to learn [a teacher]) is still needed. My only criticism is that he describes the &quot;ideal&quot; education system, that being teachers actually make students engage in lessons. Unfortunately, that isn&#39;t the case (or maybe it&#39;s only the US?). Teachers in my experience sadly do not understand how to actually teach students.<br><br>Vsauce&#39;s Michael is an amazing teacher because his method of giving information actually makes someone want to be involved. I often find myself pausing his videos part-way through just to look up the facts he presents because I find so many to be amazing and the same goes for the Veritasium channel. Michael gives information in a way that isn&#39;t just throwing stuff to a wall hoping it sticks, he makes the information relevant to the viewer.<br><br>Michael gives titles and intros to his videos using fun quirky ideas to draw people in and then give 100 facts that would otherwise make people sleep. He uses facts people had no intention of learning to support an idea or fact that they wanted to know more about. For instance, his video about why humans have two-nostrils gives tons of facts and quotes from scientists no one would have cared for if they heard their names in a lecture, but with Michael&#39;s presentation they have something they can relate the scientists too and therefore have reason to learn.<br><br>Sadly, in common education teachers just shoot out information at students hoping it sticks because with things like Standardized Tests teachers MUST TEACH a certain amount of information within a specific amount of time or else they could risk losing their jobs. If a teacher sees their students failing a chapter in Math it would be MORE logical for them to redo the chapter but with 110% more attention and thought put into the teaching. BUT instead teachers use grade curves and hope that the students will understand enough while reviewing the next chapter because in about 3mnths the SAT/ACT are coming.<br><br>This is unfortunate for students because this system actually neglects them and focuses on schools getting money. The system is about money and not the students and this is sad for people who are not as good at learning compared to other kids.<br><br>I have anxiety and depression and teachers don&#39;t know that there are things you should do to help someone in that circumstance. I have failed tests, quizzes, and homework assignments because of social issues and with my anxiety I have issues where during a test I get so nervous I forget how to spell the simplest of words OR I just forget words completely. Teachers do not understand this and cannot have any empathy for that so despite me being intelligent (From failing I am now earning my BA [which will continue to my PhD] in Physics and I am going into Quantum Physics, which is not as hard to me, but that&#39;s just me). I&#39;m not dumb and I am not a delinquent I just have serious issues that I cannot control, but teachers don&#39;t engage that (at least not in public education).<br><br>Now in my university I have gotten so depressed that I have just skipped classes for two-weeks because I lost my motivation and when I eventually returned I told my professor and she exempted me from some projects (it was Computer Art classes) and started me off with a new project based on where I left off. That is how a teacher should ALWAYS be but in public education that is not always the case. So yes, teachers should be engaging but this isn&#39;t the reality that people always see.<br><br>I just wish people as smart as him would become more involved in Politics so they can give more public recognition to the bureaucracies that rule the system and ultimately corrupt the systems they try to rule.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T20:48:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nin", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve got to say.

You seem to be looking at education strictly from a traditional classroom+ teacher model. That is but a narrow sliver of a fragment of a view of what education is or can be. Education has been revolutionized in the last 30 years... by the Internet. It has put such a wealth of information at easy access that it has completely altered the very types of knowledge that are required to thrive in society. Strict memorization and rote calculation are on the decline, whereas the ability to craft a query properly, or be able to read a piece of information critically have become orders of magnitude more important.<br>Additionally, the social environment has been vastly altered as well. We now have gone back to being a society that communicates primarily via the written word. Writing skills, particularly persuasive writing skills, have swelled in importance. We have developed an entirely new method of communication to help transmit emotional context along with our words (emoji). As these skills have become more important, so too have our reading skills, both in speed and in comprehension.<br><br>The key element of education that I think you miss in your critique is that, at its heart, education is personal. What works for student A doesn&#39;t work for student B, and student C will progress at a different rate than either or the other two. The old one-room schoolhouse was a much more ideal environment. There, each student progressed at their own pace, under the guidance of the teacher. It was, in many respects, a much less social environment than today&#39;s classroom, but the mixing of different abilities allowed for differing rates of learning. Now, with the &quot;grade level&quot; model, students are either restrained from progress in topics that they excel in, or rushed through topics that they struggle with, just because overall they fit within a fuzzy range of &quot;normal&quot; for an extremely wide age and development range, particularly in elementary school.<br>This too is where the digital age shows promise. Through the use of rudimentary AIs and evaluation protocols, it will become easier to craft an individualized education plan for each student, one that can target both the appropriate material to challenge the student, and the teaching modality that best works for that individual. You can still involve teachers, but the classrooms will become more virtual, as similar students are gathered from a much wider geographic area, and paired with a teacher that can work best with that particular group of children.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T19:37:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Vadym Prysiazhnyi", "comment_text": "maybe I was writing it before, but your channel I think one of the most serious, but yet entertaining for me. thanks) wow, you are also a physicist xD seems like a technical education makes me like your videos :)", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T19:37:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frad lows", "comment_text": "awesome", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T19:37:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VIIflegias", "comment_text": "it also depends what level of education you are talking about: if you take primary education, the role of the teacher is also to enforce learning through authority. it doesn&#39;t sound pleasant, but children tend not to sit quiet for hours pay attention to things they are not interested in (like 90 % of the curriculum) unless they feel pressured to do so.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T19:37:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fixy Lyndon", "comment_text": "So, every video you release is an excitement for me, i guess you&#39;re a great teacher then !", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T19:37:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Polyfez", "comment_text": "Hey @Veritasium!

Why wouldn&#39;t certain textile and clothing manufacturers avoid teaching you about third-world exploitation and hegemony?

We will never find a single perfect and certain way to deliver information to individuals. Because the very dynamics of this transfer is changing with every single combination of the teacher and the student. A teacher may explain a certain topic to a student and make him learn. \u00a0But when it comes to doing the same thing to another one, efficiency is not guaranteed to be as the same level as it was with the previous student.<br><br>This is because every person perceives the world in a slightly different way (literally :) ). Due to this infinitesimal difference, we tend to think that there must be a way to deliver information in a single perfect way, since we observe an average level for student&#39;s understanding of the class. This small difference fades away with the increased number of students. But, as probability dictates, although the average does not tend to change a lot, chance to find students with very different efficiency of understanding increases as well. I mean, given enough number of them,\u00a0there will always be a student in the class, who didn&#39;t understand almost anything at all after the lecture!<br><br>Because you cannot reach to each student in the same way! Some people learn through reading, some learn through visual elements, some through actively participating (like experiments and stuff) and some learn in a very different way. Of course our brains are capable of handling problems and that&#39;s why it is not creating a crucial issue to try to educate a child, who let&#39;s say learns through visual elements, by making him/her reading the material. What happens at most is that child will be diagnosed with inability to concentrate, hyperactivity or something similar.<br><br>But again, we are focusing on the wrong factor. The fact we need to realize is every student requires a different way of education. Even not for every, at least we need to be able to classify group of students, who show similar behavior to a certain way of education, and then divide them accordingly to increase the efficiency of the way we transfer information.<br><br>For example, I never like to read material. I&#39;ve chosen engineering because of this, and still cannot tolerate long paragraphs for more than 5 minutes. I&#39;m easily distracted when it comes to reading. However, when it comes to watching videos on YouTube, like Veritasium, Vsauce, MinutePhysics, or any other educational video; I am attracted to that info much more quickly. And that is not only valid for YouTube. Even some engineering courses I have, sometimes use animations and etc. and I hardly get\u00a0bored, or distracted. And I actually understand much better and efficiently compared to spending my time on reading only 3 pages information for like 1 hour...<br><br>On the other hand, some of my friends claim that they learn better through reading. And they tend to get better grades in classes that involves articles, readings etc.<br><br>Me and my friends, we all took\u00a0same courses, of course thought in only one way. Sometimes I get better grades in some of them, sometimes they do, wonder why?<br><br>Briefly, what I believe is, problem is not the medium, in which we transfer the information. Problem is we are constantly trying to impose the same-single\u00a0way (the way, with which we think we revolutionize the education) to all of the students. With every &quot;revolutionizing&quot; way, we observe some issues, and develop a way to overcome that issue. But then again we observe more issues, just after we thought that we made it perfect by fixing that previous one.

As young children, they go in open-hearted and free -- at night, they imagine that their tiny hands can reach up and touch the birds. The entire world is a new place and the fascination of beauty never subsides. But as older adolescents leaving their high school, they go close-minded and bondaged -- at night, they drink themselves into passing out and talk about the most popular thing to come, under obligation. The boys worry about their sexual conquests. The girls worry about their sexual appearance. Both worry about being social in a society that has made a weakness of kindness and an insult of emotion. Such a great change occurs between those who enter school and those who leave it.<br>Just think of the sheer idiocy of compulsory\u00a0education. We threaten these children with imprisonment if they do not appear in class. Once in class, they spend their time either sleeping or completing tasks that are completely irrelevant to them. By giving them no option in their schooling, what have we taught them? The first lesson they learn is to detest learning, to hold unbridled sympathy for education. Take any man, put him in chains, and force him to recite poetry, or force him to play an instrument, or force him to farm the land -- and once he becomes a free man, do you think he will want to engage in that activity that was forced upon him? The scars on a slaves hands from working the fields, the memories of abuse of a house servant; given the right to do as they wish in the world, is it likely to think that they will return to that work which they were forced to do? And then consider schools. We force children to sit and overfeed them erroneous facts, faulty logic, damaged reasoning, concealed under the guise of &quot;schooling.&quot; Once the mental faculties of these children are damaged, their heart grows an animosity towards learning, towards books, towards facts and knowledge. It is the greatest folly to make children hate learning, and the greatest danger to a real, living Democracy in any nation.<br><br>Because when the Red Sox win a baseball game, five universities in the state of Massachusetts\u00a0riot. But when the United States regime supports a South American dictator known for slaughtering his own people, it&#39;s a whisper lost in the wind.<br><br>Our ignorance is their power.<br><br>Real knowledge is acquired by learning what interests you, through reading, investigation, practice, or any other desirable method. To become intelligent, you must engage in activity with the idea that are you learning because you want to, because knowledge is a goal. The path to conformity varies greatly from this. First, you engage in nothing, but allow cultural standards and social obligations to control you. Second, the idea of learning is to memorize random, perhaps unrelated and blatant facts -- true or untrue -- so that they may be recited upon command. Third, the goal is not knowledge, but a passing grade; they learn to for the sake of knowledge, but rather for the sake of social acceptance.<br><br>Take two children. Give the first freedom and liberty, give him a wealth of books and movies, give him teachers to aid him upon his request and a place that encourages art, creativity, and independence. Then take away the freedom and liberty of the second, require his presence in a classroom in front of a teacher, threaten him with a jail sentence if he does not go to his school. Give each of them ten or fifteen years, and check the development of each of them after this amount of time. The only forced to endure slavery may be able to stand in a lecture hall and he might be able to say to you, &quot;George Washington was born in 1732 and died in 1799. In 1776, the Revolutionary War began where he acted as general. In 1783, it ended. In 1789, he was elected president a first time, and in 1792, he was elected president a second time.&quot; You are given dates and events, surely, it is true history. But take the child who was given freedom to do as he pleased, and he might be able to stand in a lecture hall and tell you, &quot;In the sixteenth century, in Europe, a Spanish physician by the name of Michael Servetus was convicted of heresy by the Roman Catholic Church. Fleeing from his oppressors, he made it to Geneva, where the vindictive John Calvin had absolute authority. In earlier years, Servetus expressed his doubt on Calvin&#39;s protestant religion. Once captured by the authorities, Servetus was burned to death at the orders of John Calvin in 1533. They had him wear a hat of sulphur and used slow-burning wood, that the crowd could listen to screams for mercy for the duration of a half hour. One year after the death of this man, Calvin published a list of insults of his former enemy.&quot;<br><br>Be a rebel. Because being a conformist means admitting that the parts of you that matter are already dead.<br><br>But if that&#39;s the case, what does matter? The emotions that run rampant through our head, the thoughts that we tumble and toss over in our minds constantly -- sexual fantasies to memories of our friends and family, thoughts and ideas about our future, wishes and desires for our current life with those who are close to us. The idea of a living freedom, knowing that what you wish to do believe with your mind is unrestricted and what you wish to do with your body, so long as you harm none, is unlimited. Life matters to us because we make it matter; if we never told a lover we would miss them upon our departure for a long voyage, if we never told a family member that we dream of a time when oppression ended, if we never wrote a poem and hoped to give it to a friend whose face we haven&#39;t seen in years -- if we never cared about life, then life wouldn&#39;t matter. What matters is what we make matter. So in a few years, all the kids who graduate from high school will know that their grades never mattered, because even though so young, they already know that it won&#39;t be the grades they got that they think about upon their death bed.<br><br>Twenty years ago the textbooks used in history class just began to cover some of the issues of the four hundred years of oppression of the African race in this country.<br><br>Children who are forced into a school and forced to complete erroneous assignments learn only one thing: to hate education. I clearly demonstrated this truth earlier, but there is more to be learned from it. Take a slave. It could be a slave from any society, whether an African in colonial America or a Plebeian in the Roman Empire. For the entirety of their life, they labor. Their sweat, their tears, their blood, the bi-products of their toil seep into the ground and their garments. All they produce goes to the one who did not labor (and alas, our modern Capitalist system has managed to recreate these conditions). Inside every slave, there will be a growing hatred of their activity as a servant, a farmer, a manufacturer -- they will learn to hate what has been forced upon them without their consent. But inside some of them, there will be the kindling of hope for a dream. One day, they will hope to produce for themselves, knowing that what their hands reap will be what fills their stomach, and not the stomach belonging to idle hands. So, too, it is with our compulsary education. The more we are forced into schools and our minds filled with useless facts, the stronger our thirst grows for real education, for real knowledge. Few are like this, but we exist. Others simply remain politically and emotionally sedated, as the focus of their mind is the next test or the next prom, and not children enslaved in southeast asia or the meaning of life.<br><br>To every student who must endure the excuse of an education system that we have, I can only offer these words of hope... Educate yourself, not with school teachers, but with the books they wanted to ban. Teach yourself, learn, grow, and develop. Learn that the greatest asset education can offer is that of independence.<br><br>&quot;If the teacher happens to be a man of sense, it must be an unpleasant thing to him to be conscious, while he is lecturing his students, that he is either speaking or reading nonsense, or what is very little better than nonsense.<br><br>...<br><br>&quot;The discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not for the benefit of the students, but for the interest, or more properly speaking, for the ease of the masters. Its object is, in all cases, to maintain the authority of the master, and whether he neglects or performs his duty, to oblige the students in all cases to behave to him, as if he performed it with the greatest diligence and ability. It seems to presume perfect wisdom and virtue in the one order, and the greatest weakness and folly in the other.&quot;&quot;<br>\u2014 Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book 5, Chapter I, Part 3, Article II.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T16:52:03Z", "likes_count": 201}, {"comment_by": "Sevlen", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t this just another person saying their idea is the one.
