How many vertical lines can I distinguish? For example, with VHS tapes, this is typically 260 lines. for television broadcasts this fluctuates around 400 lines. Professional video recorders and cameras could have up to 700 lines and more resolution. But we could never see it at home because the broadcasts and TVs were limited in bandwidth. The youtube 480p resolution is indeed based on the old ntsc standard. If you upload a pal sd video to youtube it will unfortunately be converted to the ntsc standard.

This is because I think with VR you need a stable scence that the user can move around in. Slowly. When the VR scene moves and you don&#39;t you feel like you are on a roller coaster. Nausea within 5 minutes. VR and AR need higher quality image, I found the grainy low quality image on PlayStation VR was unpleasant causing nausea. The PlayStation vr let me see what is possible but its not ready for pleasant gaming experiences. Games need to also be slower moving for VR, because Resident Evil VR made me feel like dying after 5 minutes. The 2D camera might be replaced by a ring of 3 or 4 cameras to make a VR or AR movie, so that we could capture the 360 of a person.

HDD&#39;s (today not &#39;56) rotate at 72.000 RPM, just thought that a Harddisk should be compared to a harddisk, even though at the time its hard to compare to nothing :). It&#39;s worth noting that originally it was hard to store magnetic information and read it again without erasing it. In the Apollo Programme, they used a more solid state technology for storage which is esentially the same magnetized principle, with the same magnetic limitations of erasing things, but to save weight, they had intervowen iron rings into copper fabric. This also significantly reduced the memory capacity, but it reduced the weight dramatically and made kept the speed needed for a navigation computer, so really that is more like long term RAM, or involatile magnetic ram, but i think its worth noting that there were alternatives to the 40.000 RPM discs, they were simply too expensive, and not really an available product. It&#39;s often the story that the problems are being solved by different people, and with solutions of different origin, and therefore also often different in nature, which leads to availability of alternatives to be smaller in variety. This means that the technological knowhow did exist, but no solution existed in the isolated market it was needed. The point is rather to point out that there were several different memory technologies at the time and prior to the year 1956, and it&#39;s not a not until year a could b happen, due to technological progress, its rather that of the problem wasn&#39;t solved untill year a because technology wasn&#39;t available.

So your saying that light has electricity in it? The electrons? What about the protons and neutrons? What happens to them? <br>As far as I&#39;m aware, for something to work it has to operate in a circuit, meaning that it cannot just have a source and a destination! There has to be a return path of some sort! Otherwise that would suggest that energy can be created and destroyed! <br>Sure! We have camera&#39;s and we all know that they work as intended! But I don&#39;t think that anyone actually understands how it works at it&#39;s fundamental level. <br>Everything on earth comes from the ground and eventually returns to the ground, a complete circuit! It&#39;s the reason why recycling makes sense, rather than putting stuff back into the ground and waiting for the earth to recycle it for us which would take to long, we recycle it ourselves and we can have it now! Again! And again! <br>How can light influence electricity? At one time in human history it was only known that a magnet has the ability to influence electricity and before that was friction and now we have light! Where is all this electricity coming from? Was it always there in the light? If so, how does a generator get the electricity out of the light? Even when it&#39;s in the dark! Is there light between my shoes and the carpet? <br>I mean even static electricity! Was the same amount of charge already there before I started rubbing my shoes on it? I can charge myself for years and discharge somewhere else but there would always be plenty more charge to give! Where are my shoes and carpet getting it all from? Why doesn&#39;t it run out? Why can&#39;t a battery keep getting it&#39;s energy from where my shoes, carpet and generators get it from? <br>I don&#39;t think that we understand what is going on, we learned how to make electricity with a device but we don&#39;t really know where the device is getting it from! <br>Ever heard of a generator having its magnet assembly being replaced because it run out of juice? Or the copper coil assembly because it has no more energy to give? So long as the bearings are greased and you keep it turning, it keeps giving! Unlike the water or steam that drives it, it runs out! <br>Does anyone have a good explanation of it other than what we are taught? Because theoretically it should run out of electricity at some point, everything runs out! Even radioactive materials stop being radioactive! That&#39;s why the nuclear batteries on the space probes eventually stop working! Why don&#39;t generators stop producing, mechanical limitations aside? <br>What have we got right and what have we got wrong? Why can&#39;t the generator just produce electricity without moving?

I also had technical help and teaching from my next door neighbor, Ric. Ric was an Electronics Engineer. The picture was scanned 32,000 times per second, this guy left out one very important detail. Before the home computer, TV&#39;s was the most complex electronic devices in the average home. One of the details left out was the sink single and sink circuit, with out which NO picture.   Think about this, the picture, sink circuit, sound, ect. had to be combined, amplified and transmitted and then received amplified, unscrambled and again amplified. I think you began to get the picture.   Of note: Philo T. Pharnsworth was a big inventor of electronic tubes.

Here\u2019s Why.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if you added the link or if YouTube added it. The title caught me right away. I didn\u2019t really notice the thumbnail. I tend to watch YouTube on my phone, so small or detailed thumbnails are harder to see.<br><br>I\u2019ve enjoyed your videos for years now. I think the first video of yours I saw was \u201cSupercooled Water - Explained!\u201d I enjoy the content of your videos from the topics you choose to the explanations and examples you provide, especially how you visualize them. You make difficult subjects much easier to understand. Your enthusiasm for your subjects comes through as well, and that makes your videos even more enjoyable, spurring my own enthusiasm for all things science.<br><br>I don\u2019t often see your videos in my YouTube feed sadly\u2014I hope YouTube will fix that\u2014but I know I will always enjoy them, so I search for your channel, go to the Videos tab, and binge watch a few videos I haven\u2019t seen yet.<br><br>I will often look for playlists as well that contain similar subjects so I can let YouTube autoplay videos. I would like to know more about the evolution of video. That\u2019s a subject that could potentially span several videos, and it felt cut short here. If you ever decide to do a mini series on the subject (maybe you have and I just can\u2019t find it?), it would make for a good playlist and be something I\u2019d search for and binge watch, like \u201cplaylist and chill\u201d instead of \u201cNetflix and chill.\u201d<br><br>I didn\u2019t used to prioritize liking a video because, as stated above, I treated it more like a mini TV series and let videos play without interruption, but lately I have tried to be more conscientious and help my favorite YouTubers by liking every video I watch and enjoy. I don\u2019t particularly like when YouTubers beg for subscriptions and likes, but at the same time I do want to help as a viewer. Explaining the importance of our actions helped me change how I interact with videos. Sometimes I do forget, so I don\u2019t mind a quick reminder at the end of a video so long as it\u2019s not prominent.<br><br>I\u2019m not really into the culture of needing to know everything that\u2019s going on at every moment, so I turn off notifications for everything except calls and texts. I\u2019ll even turn on \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d if I\u2019m working on something and don\u2019t want any interruptions short of an emergency. That way I\u2019m not tempted to browse social media or do anything other than work until I have a free moment and dedicated time to do so. I don\u2019t feel like I need to delete social apps this way, so I can still socialize and keep up with things like my favorite content creators without getting distracted all the time. I hope YouTube finds another way outside of using the bell notification to improve their algorithm since I purposefully do not click the bell and opt to manually check my favorite channels when I have time.<br><br>I would think someone actively searching for a channel would be more important for the algorithm, but that hasn\u2019t been the case for me yet. I\u2019m honestly surprised I don\u2019t see more of your videos in my feed considering how long I\u2019ve followed you and how many of your videos I watch. Now that I think of it, many other science channels I\u2019m subscribed to like Physics Girl don\u2019t show up either. I get videos on beauty, crafts, life-hacks, or for musical artists whom I\u2019m not even following, some I even actively dislike, instead. They aren\u2019t even advertised. It seems like YouTube\u2019s algorithm is catering to what the masses like, or what they want you to like, rather than what I actually personally like, and I think that may give other topics and creators an unfair advantage. What\u2019s the point of YouTube gathering statistics about what I like and how I watch videos if they aren\u2019t going to use that in practice to cater to my interests? If they are going to show everyone the same content regardless of interests, then they should at least have a curator who checks content quality if nothing else.<br><br>I hope some of that info helps you. Good luck with your resolutions this year and cracking the current algorithm. I look forward to watching more of your videos, whether or not YouTube adds them to my feed.", "comment_date": "2020-01-15T20:50:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "froghunterheroshit2", "comment_text": "This is a great educational video.

Given you have signal you can phaselock to (which is exactly the case with analog video), you can easily derive timebase for the shutter that will create aliased (downconverted) image in frequency domain of the frame/samplerate that will produce exactly the same output - as long as the exposure time per frame is kept same (and its jitter is comparably small to the desired end value) - only at cost of much longer time needed for capture (ratio of the availible framerate vs. desired capture timebase resolution). Another benefit is that you don&#39;t have to compromise the capture resolution, as the limitation by sesnor data readout speed no longer exists.<br><br>Stroboscopic effect used for motion and vibration analysis is the same principle applied.

Each beam hits a given hole from a different angle, thus preventing the beam from illuminating the incorrect phosphor.<br><br><br><br>But making all those tiny holes, not easy. Ok, I guess the holes aren&#39;t the hard part really, but the making spaces between the holes smaller.

In the early to late 80&#39;s some stations still used old equipment as they were transitioning.  We still used two old telecinies, where we broadcast late-night movies from 16mm film.  We had a few Quads (2&quot; tape machines).  The heads recorded lines perpendicular to the movement of tape.  The four heads had to be realigned quite a bit by the engineers or you would see drop-out like spots on the screen.  We also had many 1&quot; reel-to-reel tape decks, which were helical scan (at an angle).  Those were still the norm, but of course, Betacam and later, digital formats took over.  I wanted to keep one of the old 2&quot; AMPEX Quad that the one TV station was going to stop using, but knew there was no space and they were very heavy.  We also had a 2&quot; cartridge system where we had to wrap 2&quot; tape into cassettes designed for commercials.  The concept was to place one tape into one side, and it used a huge vacuum that quickly sucked the tape around the moving heads and played quickly.  Then, while that was playing, the machine would queue up another tape on the other side.  So, the cartridges had to be lined up.  At this time, it was old tech, and not reliable for live playback.  So, we created a commercial reel transferring to 1&quot; from the log given to us by the &quot;traffic&quot; department.  Wow, I&#39;m feeling old.  Yet, I&#39;m only 50.  Okay...for some of you that&#39;s old.", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T05:57:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beach Bully", "comment_text": "you really just HAD TO include the tube squeal in the intro?", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T05:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megan Mioduski", "comment_text": "I love your content and honestly don\u2019t subscribe to much.

Backward compatibility with black and white television precluded adding more guns, and the solution was even more ingenious. There was still only ONE electron gun in a color TV CRT.  What determined the brightness of the RGB pixels was that the single gun (B&amp;W) brightness voltage was secondarily modulated with a carrier frequency of 3.8Mhz. That modulation determined the proportion of signal that excited each of the R, G &amp; B phosphors along the scan line. To keep the pitch of the gun aligned, a brief burst of the 3.8Mhz carrier frequency (the &quot;color burst&quot;) was inserted at the beginning of each scan line, just after the synchronizing (horizontal) blanking signal that turned the electron gun off while the magnets reset for the next scan line. The big complication was that Inserting this color reference signal added time to each line / field / frame, though a small enough time period that it was within tolerance of B&amp;W televisions. To make time for the color burst, the 30 frames / 60 fields per second of B&amp;W became 29.97 frames per second (or 59.94 fields). This is why you see the legacy of strange frame and field timing references that have filtered into digital video for backward compatibility.  Further, to keep this color information synchronized with the base B&amp;W signals without causing &quot;harmonic ringing&quot;, the phase of the carrier was rotated across each pair of frames, so a complete &quot;in phase&quot; loop, defined as a &quot;color frame&quot;, takes 4 (interlaced) fields.  The final challenge of color TV was trying to count every frame and still stay aligned with real time clocks; the 29.97 fps vs 30 fps difference adds up to about 3 seconds (108 frames) per hour (72 seconds every 24 hours). To solve this last issue, Drop Frame time coding was created, where 2 frames (one &quot;color frame&quot;) are skipped (&quot;dropped&quot; from the count) right before the start of every minute, except at the 10 minute marks. Again, the legacy continues to be seen in digital editing programs that will offer Drop Frame time code to count the 29.97 frames (59.94 fields) legacy video timing and produce accurate real world run times.  All this TV signal engineering gets quite a bit easier to explain with the visual aid of a waveform / vector scope, an oscilloscope specifically designed for critically examining and motoring the classic NTSC video signal.", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T04:37:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean0ne", "comment_text": "this should be stickied on the frontpage of youtube!", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T00:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jorge Monteiro", "comment_text": "Hi Derek, you re better and better, I&#39;m glad to support you on Patreon.", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T00:09:16Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "number 33", "comment_text": "I watched this on a CRT but people who watch YouTube on CRTs don&#39;t tweet.", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T23:40:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Walter Burton", "comment_text": "The quiet soundtrack is a HUGE plus.

We used to have analog and mechanical methods to count, to transmit voice, even images... And now it is all in software. Most people don&#39;t even have a dedicated camera, they just use their phone&#39;s built-in camera, which even 20 years ago, if there was one, was a lovely 160x120 image. And now, even modern phones can do 4K and can perform better than studio cameras in the 90s.<br><br>Now take it a step further... Where will it go in the future?<br><br>Personally, I&#39;m excited. I look at my past. When I started with my Commodore 64, 300 bits per second 8N1 was blazingly fast. 10 years later, I had a 2400baud modem, which was insanely fast. My college used 9600baud modems to connect to our mainframe. Then a few years later, I had used 56K modems and would end up with DSL to my house. Now I use cable internet to have more speed than my entire college had in 1995.<br><br>This has lead to changes in views of how media works. As a kid, the VHS Disney collection was special because you only could buy a tape once every few years at best. I remember Target having lines for people to buy Little Mermaid on VHS. Now, people don&#39;t want to manage their media, they want someone else to do it. So we allow Youtube, Netflix, Spotify, etc. own the content and we pay them to let us see it. <br><br>At the same time, commercials have had to get more interesting and more attention grabbing to get our eyeballs, while at the same time, we move to streaming content where they can&#39;t reach us (unless using a free service) but even then, how many commercials on a streaming service sound better than  Ben Stein in Ferris Bueller? <br><br>We used to save photos of our treasured memories. Now they are in our phones, along with video.<br><br>I&#39;ll bet in a few years, we&#39;ll have supported 24/7 cameras recording our daily lives and we can just as easily snip out a piece and share with all our friends. Some companies have tried this with limited success.<br><br>But as with all things, 30 years ago, 64K of RAM. 20 years ago, 128Meg of RAM, 10 years ago 2Gigs of RAM, and now, my machine is rocking 16Gigs and  my LAPTOP has 32Gigs. Storage is cheap and will continue to be cheap.<br><br>The future is both exciting and ripe for abuse.

We had a 2&quot; Ampex reel-to-reel recorder and shot on old Plumbicon video tube cameras (big boxes on wheels with four lenses on the front that you could rotate to change the zoom level).  By college we were using 3/4&quot; U-matic tape for desk recorders and porta-packs (which had a battery life of about a half hour and were very heavy!).<br><br>As an aside; a short description on how NTSC (&quot;never twice same color&quot;) managed to shoehorn color information on top of a black and white signal would have been helpful.  I thought you were alluding to that when you said &quot;that&#39;s when we entered a new phase&quot; - though you&#39;re not usually that punny ;-)<br><br>VHS, Beta and Hi-8 were all vast improvements in recording, and the CCD cameras were a giant leap forward. To jump to the modern age I can now shoot very good 4K video on my phone and phenomenal 4K video on a dedicated camera.

While those electrons travel in the vacuum of the glass tube, a magnetic field reshapes itself in an extremely precise fashion faster than 380 000 times per second to deflect those electrons(because yes, magnetic fields affect electrons) to a specific part of the screen where the &quot;pixels&quot; on screen are actually tiny bits of phosphor that produce light when struck by electrons. \r<br>\r<br>And all of this happens so fast that a top of the line high speed camera can&#39;t capture it all. I mean, nowadays flat screens are an impressive feat of miniaturization and are very practical because there is no need to have a huge depth to allow the electrons to travel and be bended at achievable angles by a magnetic field. \r<br>\r<br>But in the end, it&#39;s just a bunch of small lights flicking on and off.\r<br>\r<br>It blows my mind how smart the people who came up with the working principle of the cathode ray tube TV were.

While you say that, the electrical coils are in the center of the picture with lots of arrows on them. This made me think that the target was somewhere in the middle between the coils, leaving me confused with the further explanation and having to watch that part twice to get it. Maybe the actual target should&#39;ve been at the center of the frame at that moment or it should&#39;ve been marked with a red circle or a big arrow. Also that explanation could&#39;ve been a bit longer for my taste, but then again this video is about the history and not only the physics, so a short explanation is also a valid choice.

They&#39;re even both similarly heavy; plasma TVs have a really thick glass display which gets heavy <i>fast</i> - and the CRT is over one cubic meter big, which you can imagine if you picture the old CRTs you guys had in your living rooms when you grew up which very likely weren&#39;t capable of a 1080 resolution.
