I cured my dandruff with a normal conditioner which added a moisture barricade to my hair.

For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God\u2019s one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.\u201d<br><br>and romans 10:9-13:<br>\u201cIf you declare with your mouth, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, \u201cAnyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame.\u201d For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile\u2014the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him, for, \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\u201d<br><br>so God is coming at a time we least expect, and if we put our faith and trust in Him and repent (turn away) from our sin He will gift us His grace and clothe us with the righteousness of His blood (but of course death could not hold Him, He is risen!) and we will have eternal life in His kingdom where there will be there will be no more death, or sorrow, or crying. there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. because He loves you so much! (romans 5:6-8) but if we deny and reject Him and don\u2019t repent from our sins to follow God, then we will have our part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. so hear these words, repent and believe the gospel! accept Jesus Christ and confess your sins to Him so that He will forgive you and give you a life with truth, love, joy, and peace. which will never fade away or perish. this is all if you haven\u2019t done this yet and Jesus Christ hasn\u2019t saved you yet, also when you have time please you should watch this channel here on youtube called \u201cChrist forgiveness ministries\u201d and hear what they have to say, glory to God.

In my experience as a user, anti-dandruff shampoo works great as a treatment for those areas too. The redness and flaking have the same cause, (yeast degrades skin fat [sebum], fatty acids produced cause an inflammatory response), and the yeast can be supressed in the same way. <br><br>In my own case, I have found it also effective for the related fungal infections of tinea pedis (athletes foot), tinea cruris (jock itch/ringworm) and the skin pigmenting tinea versicolor (Pytiriasis). Same method applies. Wet area, apply shampoo, foam in, leave on for a minute or two, rinse off and dry. I apply such shampoo on a sponge in the shower, to my scalp and anywhere else my experience indicates it might be of benefit. People who have fungal problems on one area of the body tend to be prone to fungal problems on other areas. NOTE: I merely relate this as personal testimony of how it works for me ... I am not giving medical advice.<br><br> You&#39;ll find these antifungals are pretty generic; that is, zinc pyrithione is also used to stop fungal rot in fencing timber! Other antifungals, like the azole group, e.g. ketoconazole, also kill or inhibit fungi and will have the same effect.

I know that you understand and are sympathetic to what I&#39;m about to say, although I&#39;m slightly disappointed that you didn&#39;t give at least a cursory nod to the conflict of interest inherent in making this sort of video.  It may seem trivial, like I&#39;m looking for trouble where there isn&#39;t any, but with American culture gradually spiraling into fact-averse fascism, any opportunity to enhance the public&#39;s ability to think critically and independently should not be glossed over.<br><br>What in hell am I talking about? you all ask.  Healthy skepticism, folks, healthy skepticism.  I just retired after 40 years of practicing medicine, and the content of this video really struck a familiar chord in me.  This seeming &quot;free lunch&quot; from Procter and Gamble isn&#39;t free -- there&#39;s a price attached to it.  It&#39;s tempting to credit Derek with the clear and engaging presentation of the content, but I guarantee you that he was just along for the ride.  This was a highly choreographed presentation that P&amp;G gives regularly to influential media arbiters of scientific public opinion.  And it was well done.  There were no problems with inaccurate factual content.  They enlightened us regarding some aspects of yeast colonization of the scalp.  They told the truth.  Some of it, anyway, and spun slightly to meet their needs.  This video is really propaganda-lite, very similar to the aggressively manipulative, truth mauling &quot;educational material&quot; with which the pharmaceutical industry (including P&amp;G) attempts to buy the minds of physicians.  It&#39;s easier to understand the potential pitfalls if you know the right questions to ask which, of course, the average person doesn&#39;t.  Questions like: (1) is dandruff really a problem, or is it just the footprints of a commensal, symbiotic relationship we&#39;ve had with these yeast organisms since the dawn of time (if dinosaurs and proto-birds had it, this possibility seems more likely), (2) we know that chemicals applied to the scalp turn up in the cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain, via the penetrating veins which communicate between the epidermis of the scalp and the subarachnoid space.  Is this KNOWN to be safe?  (3) treatment never eradicates the organism, just suppresses it, so that it rebounds when treatment is stopped (they didn&#39;t tell us that, did they?)  In light of that, are there simpler, less expensive options with less potential toxicity?  (4) is it possible that this organism is there for a reason?  Maybe serves a purpose?  It wouldn&#39;t be the first time that our hubris lead us down the wrong road (i.e. conflating the ABILITY to do something with the NECESSITY to do it.", "comment_date": "2018-11-17T01:45:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Kinseth", "comment_text": "Needless to say. . .

Their estimate of 50% of people having dandruff is likely inflated by stretching the definition because the dead skin has to come of at some point. Tobacco companies would also talk about seemingly related facts that work in their favor, like &quot;no throat irritation in those that took their 30 day challenge,&quot; and this fungus science sounds like the crafted side discussion that&#39;s designed to sell instead of a randomized consumer test that compares no shampoo use to various shampoos with measured amount of daily dandruff along with other factors. Was the active ingredient in the shampoo even mentioned? The product may work and be great, but whenever the facts are coming from a company they need to be approached with skepticism.

I&#39;m 24 and had dandruff from my early teen. I tried almost all shampoo and oil on the planet, on a daily basis, just to get rid of it. Unfortunately none worked. Finally I figured out a work around, after loosing a good amount of hair. It&#39;s not which brand of shampoo or what kind of oil you put on the head, but instead the key is never to leave your scalp dry and the timing(not AM or PM, but timing relative to you taking bath) of application of oil. What worked for me is this. I&#39;ll apply shampoo(head and shoulders) once a week (mostly Sunday mornings) and after 2-3 hours after bath, when the head becomes dry, apply a lot of oil on the scalp, to maintain wetness of scalp. Any oil can help, I tried coconut and castor oil. Again I&#39;ll take another bath at night with fresh water only. For the rest of the week, I&#39;ll apply oil 2 hours before bath, and rinse the head with only fresh water, one time daily(mostly nights). Now I can say, my head is dandruff free, almost out of magic. Wish I should have figured out this earlier, before losing my thick hair. Maybe someone else can benefit from my experience. Maybe it&#39;s the anti fungal property of oil, not allowing the fungus to develop(remember to apply oil just when your head is dry after shampooing) and grow...", "comment_date": "2018-10-24T17:00:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "id104335409", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t use H&amp;S - it gives me lots of dandruff, bumps and itches all over my head.
