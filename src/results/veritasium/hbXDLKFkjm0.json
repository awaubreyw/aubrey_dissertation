Your comment that the hydrogen for water on the moon can come from the solar wind really caught my imagination. I&#39;d never considered that aspect of it. <br><br>So, here&#39;s an interesting back-of-the-envelope calculation:<br>    Solar wind density: N = 3 particles / cm^3<br>    Particle velocity: 495 Km/s = 49,500,000 cm/s<br><br>Now, presumably, half the particles are protons and the other half are electrons, so our solar wind density for protons becomes N = 1.5 protons / cm^3<br><br>So In 1 sec:  1.5 * 49,500,000 = 74,250,000 protons hit each square centimeter of the moon&#39;s surface.<br><br>Now, the moon has been around for about 4.5 billion years, so how many protons have hit each square centimeter over the lifetime of the moon?<br>    74.25e+8 particles/s*cm^2 * (4.5e+9 years * 365 days/year * 86400 s/day) = 1.054e+25 protons/cm^2<br><br>Let&#39;s do some basic chemistry: <br>    1 mole of any substance = 6.02e+23 particles (or protons in our case)<br>    1.054e+25 protons/cm^2<br>    ------------------------------------ = 17.5 moles of protons <br>    6.02e+23 protons/mole<br><br>   Every mole of of water has two protons, i.e, H2O. So 17.5 moles of protons can theoretically make<br>   <br>   17.5 moles - H<br>   ----------------------- = 8.75 moles of water.<br>    2 H - mole H2O<br><br>   Each mole of water weighs 18 grams. Let&#39;s pretend that every proton of the solar wind finds a willing oxygen atom to join with.<br><br>   8.75 (moles - H2O) * 18.0 g / (mole - H2O) = 157.5 g - H2O.<br><br>So, each square centimeter of the Moon has received enough protons from the solar wind to create 157.5 g of water. But how much water is that?<br><br>Water has a density of 1 g / cm^3, so each square centimeter of the Moon could generate... <br>     157.5 g<br>   --------------- = 157.5 cm^3 =&gt; 0.1575 liters of water / cm^2<br>   1 g/cm^3<br><br>Now, the total area of the Moon absorbing solar wind from the sun is the area of the CIRCLE facing the sun, not the surface area of a SPHERE. So the Moon presents an area of:<br>   Moon radius: 1.737e+8 cm.<br>   pi * (1.737e+8 cm)^2 = 9.479e+16 cm^2<br><br>So the theoretical total amount of water generated by the solar wind:<br>   9.479e+16 cm^2 * 0.1575 liters / cm^2 = 1.493e+16 Liters of water<br><br>How deep would all that water be if we let it spread out over the surface of the Moon?<br>Surface area of a sphere? A = 4 * pi * r^2<br>   4 * pi * (1.737e+8 cm)^2  = 3.791e+17 cm^2<br><br>   1.493e+19 cm^3 H2O<br>   ----------------------------------  = 39.37 cm - H2O <br>   3.791e+17 cm^2<br><br>So, that leads to a final result of about 40 cm water covering the entire surface of the moon! <br><br>This is about enough to come up to your calves if you wanted to sloshing around in it.
