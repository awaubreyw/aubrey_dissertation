My hand starts out partially twisted to the right (I bowl right handed) and I twist it to the left.  My best game was around 192 I think, a few strikes and spares with the other shots hitting most of the pins.  Next time I go bowling I&#39;ll have to keep this video in mind as the only trick I really employed was twisting the ball and aiming for that particular spot (I don&#39;t think anyone ever told me where to aim but it&#39;s pretty intuitive).", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T22:30:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Salih Art And Tech", "comment_text": "Great Video as usual \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T08:51:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gwen", "comment_text": "this takes so much of the magic out of bowling lmao. it&#39;s just an illusion", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T04:39:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I CAM45m5o I", "comment_text": "i love how my interest in science is gonna make me mad cash when i hustle 14 year old&#39;s at the bowling alley", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T19:44:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gandalf47", "comment_text": "Back in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, I was a real good bowler. I had my own shoes, ball, wrist glove, and was in all the leagues, competitions, and even on the UCSB Bowling Team.  We used a solid, black rubber ball that was 16lb. That&#39;s it. I have no idea about the old, and had to adjust to each lane each tiem I bowled. I guess I&#39;m a sports purist - don&#39;t like the DH in baseball - but all this high tech tinkering with ball and the lane seems to take some of the skill out of the game. I had to stop bowling when I was 44 due to huring my back, and I still had a 190-200 average back then. I loved bowling as a kid, since I had asthma for the first 13 years of my life, so bowling and pool were the only two sports I could play, and I became very good at both. I guess I should look up pool and billiards to see how they have messed with the &quot;center of gravity&quot; of those spherical shaped solid balls to enhance performance. I&#39;m guessing no tampering with pool balls, but I would not have guessed all the engineering and maninpulation that goes into bowling today. I suppose anyone can adjust to new parameters, but I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t use aluminum bats in the MLB.

The technology that came around over the years, made everyone a better bowler. These days it is very common to see a 175 average bowler shoot 300. The 300 game is pretty common all over the U.S. For every 300 bowled in a sanctioned league makes you eligible to buy a gold 300 ring a the market rate of gold. They are fairly expensive. I bowled my first 300 when I was 20 years old and back then, the 300 game was rare so the gold rings were at no charge to the bowler. That is the one that is very special to me because It cost me nothing. every one after that, I had to pay for it if I wanted to. Bowling in a league was like going to church. You would see each other once a week.  I have made many friends as a result of bowling but since the closure I hardly see the people I used to bowl with anymore. It was a wonderful time in my life.

They changed it to allow us to do shorter oil patterns and then quit checking altogether after award scores were shot.  Once they quit checking everyone changed the oil patterns to a &quot;blocked shot&quot; which is usually hardly any oil on first 10 boards of the lane then a large wall in the middle of lane so the ball rolls along the wall to the end of the oil then hooks into the pocket.  It is like rolling your ball on a railroad track to the pocket.  They still use blocked shots almost everywhere today.  A blocked shot makes it super easy to score high, yes the bowling ball technology has increased since the 80&#39;s.  I will tell you this , put out a difficult pattern where it is more a crown shot with no more than 3 units of oil difference between each board and most bowlers averages will drop by as much as 30 pins a game. In the end making the game easier was the death of the sport as most bowling alleys have closed in this area, there use to be 4 more than there is today and league bowling is at a all time low even before covid.", "comment_date": "2022-01-07T04:02:03Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Easton Luzum", "comment_text": "We still have wood lanes", "comment_date": "2022-01-07T02:35:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Lopez", "comment_text": "WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM", "comment_date": "2022-01-06T21:27:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SKRUBL0RD", "comment_text": "the reason most people think bowling balls are just solid spheres is because all house balls are solid plastic balls so every casual bowler intuitively doesn&#39;t notice any sort of odd physics happening.", "comment_date": "2022-01-06T20:14:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "First Choice", "comment_text": "what a great video  .", "comment_date": "2022-01-06T18:36:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RE H", "comment_text": "When I was young, I loved to bowl, but I couldn&#39;t hook a ball to save my life.

I get that this is an explanation to noobs, but really this is bad. I started bowling about 1975 ish, and continued through the next 20+ years. Rubber, plastic, urethane and resin balls. I was a season away from a PBA card until I popped  the tendon in my ring finger. I was a cranker, ala PDW, Amletto, Mark Roth, and after my injury was still at 18-20 mph and 25+ revs. I knew friction coefficients of every one of the 20+balls I used, their drilling patterns and the effect of each one. I wont name brands, but I still have Storm equipment. What the advanced bowler can do vs the once in a while bowler is night and day. I get ragged on that I still have my own equipment and refuse to use house shoes and balls. Yeah my span and pitch angles have changed, but this video is equating success to equipment, just like Ebonite did with their first resin balls. This game is as complex as any other, try reading an oil pattern, then choosing the right balls, lines, break points, and the carry down through the game. Yes by creating an angle you increase the the amount of contact are, but it is your release, alignment and understanding of your game that will help you. No I did not get my card, my injury (at age 24) has never healed and I can not lift the way I want to. Oh yeah there is this thing called lift, that is where you use your fingers to create both forward and angular rotation on the ball. YOU DONT FREAKING SPIN THE BALL!!!!! YOU LIFT THROUGH THE BALL TO CREATE ROTATIONAL FORCES AND USE THE WEIGHT BLOCK, COVER STOCK AND SPEED TO CHANGE DIRECTION / ANGLE!  PDW and Chris Barns and on a different level than 99% of us. I Idolized PDW and spent years practicing and learning the game and still can not come close. This video is over simped. It is not just the ball, but the driller, the coach, the player and the skills of that player to read lanes and adjust their equipment and body. Hell I watched PDW win a tourney with a Bobcat drilled 3/4 finger (hook 3, length 5, weight block: 3 piece) to blow out a player with a 10+ hook ball, Rhino black (dull urethane, hook potential of 6-7,if I recall correctly, 3 piece weight block drilled3/4-1/2.)

I was the backup for our team in regionals but was also offered substantial grants to go play for colleges.

My 11th ball gave me this really random, fucked up split (I believe it was a 4-10) and I screwed it up pretty good, despite getting the highest game of the entire match. There was a all crowd watching me and everyone else in the alley stopped and watched me by the 7th frame. Each time I threw the ball, I&#39;d come back and see another 40-50 people standing behind me.

There is soooo much to talk about with tennis in regards to spin and friction.  In addition to topspin, tennis players routinely use backspin, side-spin, and spiral-spin as well.  If you really want to have some fun, try explaining the physics of the kick serve.  This is a serve in tennis where the ball curves through the air in one direction, dips down, and then when it hits the ground it bounces in the opposite direction!!!  Then there&#39;s the different court surfaces, hardcourt, clay, and grass, and how each spin response to those.  If the surface has more friction then topspin will make the ball kick up higher.  Then for backspin the ball can react differently depending on it&#39;s incoming velocity.  If a ball hit with backspin is slow (in the horizontal direction) then when it hits the ground it stops short and bounces higher, but... if a ball hit will backspin is traveling faster then it will skid and stay low.  Tennis players know and use all of these spins and reactions off the court to their advantage .  Pro tennis players are masters of spin and knowing the effects of spin on a ball.  It&#39;s all part of the game.

However, that usually ends up in a split so the best approach is to rather hit the pins a little bit to the side. More specifically, hit at around board 17.5 to hit pins 1, 3, 7, 9 to create a domino effect. So this is obviously tough because you need to aim for a spot smaller than a dim. However if you hit it from the side, that then widens the target significantly. To do this, you need to curve the ball so it hits the pins at an angle of 6 degrees. This is done easily by utilising the oil laid out on the first 3/4 of the track to rotate the ball fast enough so that when it gets to the unsoiled final 1/4 of the track, it hooks dramatically. However, you need to take into account the displacement of the oil due to bowling balls interacting with the oil as well as the oil layouts of certain tracks. You need to adapt to the circumstances, never throwing it too far outward or too close inward to avoid any unwanted friction discrepancies. If you want to, you can study the common oil layouts of bowling tracks all named after animals. You also should take into account the inner weights of a bowling ball by estimating its radius of giration and then its moment of inertia. You can estimate this more effectively by letting the ball spin on a cushion of air until it settles on is heavier side. Once you calculate this, you want to throw on a spin somewhere between the minimum and maximum moment of inertia. This is made easier if you get a manufactured bowling ball with rad-4 cores becausw of its prwferred spin axis. Its also important to account of the surface material of your bowling ball. The top 5 most influential factors of a ball curve is the amplitude of surface roughness, the coefficient of friction in an oiled lane, surface roughness by spacing. The coefficient of friction with a dry lane, and how quickly the ball surface absorbs oil. This is why its important to stay up to date with manufactured bowling ball technology as it could mean the difference between winning and losing. But remember, the direction of your ball can still be impacted by hundeds of other factors like the colour of your ball. So as long as you keep that in mind, you will be able to throw the perfect bowling ball.", "comment_date": "2021-10-09T14:27:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jlinkels", "comment_text": "I think there is a very thin line between what is acceptable and not acceptable anymore in adding technology to something which is strictly a personal skill.

Kegeln lanes most of the time are found in the backrooms of bars, so called Kneipen (German beer halls). The mechanical system to get the pins upright again is also different, in Kegeln the pins are attached to strings which is more efficient considering space but more prone to tangling, I have never witnessed a game in which the pins didnt need to be untangled at least once.<br><br>So in Germany only the american version is called bowling and the german version is called Kegeln.

I wonder how different the balls with radically different shapes inside feel and operate.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t know they intentionally put oil on the lanes&quot;<br>Really? Fowl badly just once and you very much will know it, in an extremely physical way.  It is very embarrassing, as anyone who sees it, even three lanes over, will spontaneously burst into momentary uncontrollable laughter.  It is very hard not to.  Think of what most everyone does when learning to water ski.  It looks pretty much exactly like that, but with a hard arresting surface, which makes it infinitely funnier than the beginning skier, which really isn&#39;t funny, at all.  <br><br>My guess is that that oiling pattern gets ruined during the day, with balls carrying the thicker oil to the intended thinner areas...just a guess.  I remember my aunt, who was very good, not that far from a 200 average, say that her average improved a LOT when accurate pattern oiling was coming into its own.  This must happen to at least some degree as you can see oil on the ball when it returns, so at a minimum the oil is being depleted, especially if everyone is bowling on the same line.<br><br>If you hit the headpin square on it is actually the antithesis of a &quot;perfect strategy&quot;.  The &#39;big four&#39; split is not the hardest one to clear, but it is certainly  hard enough.  Obviously percentages vary with skill, but they aren&#39;t particularly high for anyone.  I&#39;ve done it several times, but equating to pool, a completed intended four railer occurs for me about as often, one time in a whole major slew of attempts (how&#39;s that for quantifying?), in a game situation.<br><br>I used to throw pretty hard, probably much too hard, but it was always satisfying to hear those strikes that sound like a single impact and basically just explode off the boards.  Kind of like a crack/bang sound, and visually very satisfying.<br><br>Man, that was a wide strike at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFPJf-wKTd0&amp;t=7m10s\">7:10</a> and they usually look about like that.  This is what people would call luck (doesn&#39;t exist) but is actually just the tails of the bell curve, a few sigma out.  GREAT choice of shot for that point, BTW, about as marginal as it can possibly get.  It is kind of like when you see a pro pool player raise their hand to say sorry, while personally thinking they will take ten more of those.  Obviously in pro bowling the response is not remotely as reserved.  :-/  &quot;You wanted it, you got it&quot; with a raised fist.  Funny, I wonder what his response is the 85% of the time he hits that far out of the pocket and it doesn&#39;t fall?  Maybe &quot;You wanted it, it didn&#39;t matter?&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that is impossible ..&quot;  Then immediately shows that it isn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve seen several strikes thrown on the adjacent land to the bowler&#39;s.  Problem is, it&#39;s a gutter, zero, zip, nada.  Personally I think you should get twenty points and the next three balls counted, as it is VERY difficult to pull off. :-) /S<br><br>The problem with curves, especially late high angle versions is that while the target is notably larger, the path is notably harder to execute accurately, so there&#39;s that.<br><br>&quot;The determinator&quot;  LOL, the guy who named that machine has been watching too many cartoons, and probably has a good sense of humor.  I like it.<br><br>Ah, you verified my oil movement idea later on.  The fact that the robot lost was just stupid.  All it needed was a feedback system to see the ball&#39;s impact point on each throw and modify the trajectory accordingly and it would have smashed the pro.  I&#39;m virtually certain that the robot&#39;s designers were fully aware of this phenomena from previous tests (how could they not be, really?) and purposely did not add some feedback for some reason that escapes me entirely.  If I had been the engineer and known the test was coming up, I would have...probably politics of some sort, almost always is.  An applied AI program today would make mince meat of that problem, given enough varying lane conditions, etc, to practice (learn) on, and just like with Casparov (or Fischer, don&#39;t remember) in chess, it would trounce the human. Hell, they drive cars better now, a vastly more difficult proposition.<br><br>You could do a video on friction alone, or at least fundamental forces, and the new discoveries of what really drive them, often not what we thought, ten or a hundred years ago.<br><br>Great vid, dude, as always.

Every game is different, and managing to get a perfect game is something that requires a mix of skill and luck. Throwing a perfect game is hard, but not impossible; throwing a perfect series is straight up insane. But what really drove me to bowl competitively was that your opponent wasn&#39;t the person next to you; it was the game itself. The pins are your opponent, the lane is your playing field, and the ball is all you got. Once it&#39;s released, there&#39;s nothing you can do but watch to see if it hit the mark, and pray you guessed right.

Haha!!  Were the lanes freshly oiled or dry?  Did it rain that day or no?  Never know what the lanes are going to be like.  So you gotta make sure you have the right ball.  It&#39;s funny too because I started bowling thinking I was just going to hang out with friends and get drunk.  My best friend invited me to join his league team.  I had no gear at all.  So, I bought a ball, shoes, and some accessories.  I never realized just how much money I would end up spending solely on bowling balls.  $200+ per ball plus the cost of drilling?  The sport adds up quick!  I think at the peak, I had 6 balls.  A core 3-4 of which I used during almost every match and the other 2-3 I only needed in very specific conditions, typically if I bowled at a different house with a different pattern or cold vs hot weather since the temp differences can be massive where I live.  <br><br>But everything in this video is exactly what serious (not necessarily professional) bowlers analyze every single time they throw a ball.  Where do you setup?  Which slide pad are you going to use for this approach?  What targeting system are you using?  What board are you throwing at?  What balls is everyone throwing?  How is the oil movement of their balls going to impact the line that your ball takes?  Are you staying ahead of the changes or are you chasing the lane?  How many times do you have to ring the 10 pin before you&#39;ll stop being stubborn and make an adjustment?

It was a Brunswick Rhino.  I &quot;believe&quot; it was the red one, as I had both red and black Rhinos in my bags.  I had it drilled so the weights would rotate along my track (the way my ball rolled when I released it), maximizing the velocity of the heavy outer parts of the weight block.  That gave it a HUGE increase in inertia, much like a gyroscope.  It made it MUCH harder for the impact with the pins to deflect my ball.  My league-mates would watch in disbelief how well the ball would break, even on wet lanes, and how my light hits on the headpin would still carry through and take out the five pin, giving me strikes when I &quot;should have&quot; left pins standing.  I would say, on the average, it gave me 10-15 extra pins per game.  If you can EVER find a modern ball with such a weight block, buy it.  How you have it drilled makes ALL the difference, so make sure to put the weights parallel to your track.  You can find your track by rolling your dry ball down a freshly oiled lane, and looking at the wet circle made by the oil on the surface of the ball.  Generally, a &quot;full roller&quot; is considered the best, meaning the ball rolls along the largest part of the surface, centered on the space between your thumb hole and finger holes.  In my case, however, I threw a &quot;semi-roller&quot;, meaning my track was diagonally above and to the right of the finger holes (top left to bottom right), and ran along a path about 90% of the diameter of the ball.  I only weighed about 145 lbs. dripping wet and threw the heaviest ball I could get (~16.2 lbs. before drilling, if I remember correctly), as I considered control and carry more important than velocity.  Why would it matter if I could throw it (a lighter ball) faster, if I couldn&#39;t hit where I was aiming and the ball wouldn&#39;t carry as well?", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T18:34:21Z", "likes_count": 109}, {"comment_by": "Lon", "comment_text": "Pete Weber was about to lose his mind being asked to throw a gutterball on the dry lane", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T18:25:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James de la Cruz", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why bowling is a tougher sport than people think and why I&#39;m in three leagues a week including a sport shot league.

What has made the most difference, by FAR in how much you can hook the ball is the material the ball is made of and the texture of the surface. (is is sanded or polished?) <br>In the old days, they were only made of hard rubber.  Those only would hook so much.   Then they came out with polyester (or plastic as we called them) and those were better in some cases.  <br>Then in 1980, AMF introduced the first urethane ball, the Angle.   <br>Not long after, Fab came out with the Hammer, and the race was on. <br>Urethane ball technology advanced through the 80&#39;s, but it only went so far.  <br>But in the early 90&#39;s, they came out with reactive urethane, and that was a HUGE game changer.  The biggest one we&#39;ve ever had.  The bowling centers had to add more oil because reactive balls gripped so well and hooked so much.   If you took a reactive ball back in time and bowled on a 70&#39;s or 80&#39;s oil pattern, you wouldn&#39;t be able to keep it on the lane...it&#39;d be like the dry lane in this video. <br>Then they expanded on this tech, but reactive urethane was the biggest leap ever, by far.   Reactive gave much bigger hooks to people who used to be able to just barely hook it.  <br><br>Along the way, the weight blocks were changing and certainly contributed to the tweaking of the shape of your shot, but the biggest change ever was reactive urethane.   You can&#39;t put a fancy weight block in a plastic ball and make it hook like the pros, but you can put reactive resin on an old-timey weight block and it&#39;ll still hook like crazy.  <br>It&#39;s kind of like the distances in golf.  The biggest hitters today can&#39;t hit it any farther with yesterday&#39;s equipment than the biggest hitters of back then, but they crush it with the balls and clubs they use today.<br><br>As far as scores go, the oil pattern is what changed to allow more 300&#39;s and 800 series.   That changed in the 80&#39;s, when they went to &quot;short oil&quot; patterns.  Averages skyrocketed, and the number of perfect games was ridiculous.  I remember when, where I&#39;m from, there had been like 2-3 300 games EVER, then in the 80&#39;s there were multiple 300&#39;s each week.   That certainly wasn&#39;t because the bowlers got better.  You had older guys who were 180 lifetime average bowlers, suddenly averaging 210.  The scratch bowlers, who previously averaged in the lower 200&#39;s, were up between 220-230.    \r<br>That&#39;s not changed since.  They could bring scores down with tougher oil patterns if they wanted to, but why would they?  You&#39;d probably have a mass exodus when all the bowlers who now average between 200-210 fell down to 160-170, and of course the bowling centers don&#39;t want that.", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T15:34:55Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Antoine Pageau", "comment_text": "Bowling, another one of those sports like golf where there better you are the less you play...", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T15:26:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krijs Kovacic", "comment_text": "Maybe this is answered somewhere in this thread: With so many Bowling Facilities closed/out of business since Covid, are they still making 3000 bowling balls a day?", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T15:25:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vikram sawant", "comment_text": "Hey man, can you please do a video on whether America\u2019s Moon landing was fake or real and settle it for all or us\ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T15:23:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M S", "comment_text": "Yeah, well, you know, that&#39;s just like, ah, your opinion, man", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T15:19:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PowerScissor", "comment_text": "It killed that guy to roll down a lane without oil.", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T15:17:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ly He", "comment_text": "We already know how the pins are made from the Simpsons.", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T15:15:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip Oliver Holtz", "comment_text": "love bowling, avgd 160 in league as a 10yr old and was shocked find out about off center balls.

For I delivered unto you, first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures\u201d.<br><br>Romans chapter 3 verse 23, informs us, <br><br>\u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God\u201d.  <br><br>Ultimately it is a redeeming plan set by God, and for anybody who will faithfully trust in his Son will be saved. <br><br>Romans chapter 6 verse 23, says,<br><br>\u201cFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\u201d.<br><br>A sinner must recognise the despairing of her or his guilt before God in order for forgiveness to take effect. <br><br>Every believer must understand in order to inherit the kingdom of God as sons of the king, the reality and foundational truth of sin must be acknowledged, for all who approach the throne of God for salvation. <br><br>God promises us eternal life, for anybody who departs from sin through the saving faith in Jesus Christ. <br><br><br><br>Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life which no person could live. Jesus\u2019s sacrifice on the cross ultimately paid the debt we owe to God for our sin.<br><br>Sin against an infinite God requires an infinite sacrifice; and Jesus died a substitutionary death for the sinner. <br><br>In short, the works of Jesus paid the penalty of sin through an infinite sacrifice. Only the creator of life has the power to resurrect life after death and is essentially the proof of the power of God.<br><br>Jesus Christ offers his salvation as a free gift and only be received by faith, despite any works or worthiness on our part. <br><br>The scripture in Romans informs us,<br><br>\u201cIf you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\u201d.<br><br>In conclusion, the resurrection of Christ is to bring everlasting life and salvation to anybody who follows him.

A 300 game was rare back then, front sports page big letter headlines.  Now those off set weights in a bowling ball make them hook way more.  People toss them faster, knowing they&#39;ll hook at the end.  So lane owners added more oil to protect the lanes.  It&#39;s a totally different game than 60 years ago.

In this game you have 9 pins and a whole set of different rules eg for constellations you can knock down for different amount of points, it also allows for teamplay opposed to bowling. Another difference is that the balls aren&#39;t drilled and you rather roll them instead of them spinning on the lane. It&#39;s a more traditional sport mostly played by boomers the average age in a club is probably around 50 or more. The machines used are mostly older and simpler but quite similar to bowling ones. There are also completely analog versions of that, pretty much the way Martin Luther must have played it. I don&#39;t know if this is a thing outside of Germany but here it really is a known an renowned sport.

I wonder what you would make of cricket. Typically bowlers will ensure the ball is bounced off the pitch before it reaches the batsman. Spin bowling is popular, which is aided by the bowler shining one half of the ball while leaving the other side rough. Bowlers will often look for defects in the pitch so they can aim to bounce the ball from that point to make the ball\u2019s trajectory even more unpredictable for the batsman. It\u2019s not permitted for a batsman to defend their wicket with their leg, so when a ball hits the batsman\u2019s leg and it appears that otherwise the ball would have hit the wicket, the batsman can be given \u2018out\u2019 on the basis of \u2018leg before wicket\u2019. This is sometimes difficult for the umpire to judge, so in recent years they\u2019ve developed technology which shows the trajectory of the ball if it hadn\u2019t been interrupted. Of course, cricket is an outdoor game played on grass pitches, so it is highly affected by the condition of the pitch, the wind, temperature, moisture, etc.", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T10:46:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zuygj bnsv", "comment_text": "&quot;This is the biggest, most in-depth video about bowling, ever.&quot; Love the self-confidence.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:28:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rusty Shackelford", "comment_text": "You should do one oglf these on disc golf discs...", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:27:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenroy Gobourne", "comment_text": "I feel like the original title and thumbnail combo was more effective", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:23:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VivaciousBeauty575", "comment_text": "Now do five pin this in depth", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:23:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "knivesron", "comment_text": "is it just me or does that first guy look like kent hovind", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:22:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michael west", "comment_text": "yes this title is better, it got me to click knowing full well it was the same video I seen yesterday with a different title that I didnt click on. lol", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:21:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zetsu Tsuletsu", "comment_text": "It would be kinda interesting to be able to say &quot;I make bowling balls for a living&quot;.. ...well now that I think about it... saying you make any kinda sport equipment is interesting to me lol", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:20:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Cotoc", "comment_text": "Why Jason Belmont wasn\u2019t mentioned?", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T02:18:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Wetor", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not sure what the weight block inside my ball looks like, but it is rather humbling to accidentally drop the ball while throwing and see the ball do a better job than my planned release.

There were so many  variables and balls so ordinary in construction   that it was more like playing golf with the player having to learn the lane and all its attributes in the shortest time possible during tourneys.  Getting 300 even in the pro league was  a celebrated feat bec of these variables. After stopping for a decade or so I asked  a friend why people (even at lower levels) seemed to be hitting higher scores  and (at higher levels) 300 more often.  They said Synthetic lanes. Even machine oiling. Better pin machines. And the so called reactive balls with these customized cores. Short story, bowling seemed to have gotten &quot;easier&quot;. I get the fun factor. And new tools in the box make for better watching. But it seems to me to take the old challenge out of it.  Ignore this. It&#39;s just an old bowlers rant.", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T00:16:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jared Kozar", "comment_text": "Why did you change the title/thumbnail?

In order for a perfect game, every frame&#39;s strike must be followed by 2 more to make an even 30 pins/frame. To compensate for this, the tenth allows for a follow-up to a maximum of 3 shots or 3 strikes. If you were to spare in the tenth however, you would only get one more shot whether you strike or not. If the first rack of pins is not all knocked down, meaning not a spare or strike at the beginning of the tenth frame, then no follow-up shots would be allowed.

The bowling alleys we had available were all built in the 1930s to 1960s.  I never  was any good at it.  Just wasn&#39;t fun to lose all the time and my coordination was probably poor.  By my teens, it was embarrassing to me that my mom was a much better bowler.  So I stopped bowling because I was so bad at it.  There were no weird cores in balls then.  All lane floors were wood.  They tried their best to manufacture slick surface symmetrical balls although later seemed to prefer surfaces with friction.  Frankly, you bought a bowling ball then by whether you liked the color and how many finger holes it provided and by the weight wanted.  The balls seemed to be like rock if they had high resistance or smooth slick surfaces if you wanted something really colorful.  No plastics.  There wasn&#39;t all those choices then.<br><br>My step dad on the other hand could bowl over 250 all the time and had several 300 games.  He would do a few trial throws and change lanes if he didn&#39;t like his results.  I remember when he bowled an under 200 game he would be moody for days.  Him and mom were in leagues for a while.  She had a light colorful slick ball and he had the heaviest they made then that felt like a rougher surface than hers but still smooth.  I don&#39;t think the lanes got oiled ever then.  I remember they would do some nightly waxing  and the lanes were actually repaired or replaced once a month as the places would have to shut down for a few days to do it.  They actually called it waxing the lanes so it might have been wax laid down not oil then.  We all kidded him that he was playing heavy baseball more than bowling.  He would throw the heavy ball so hard it would go about 15 feet straight out before starting to come down and would crash into the lanes and then the pins with so much force that they often would fly out of the pin area.  He didn&#39;t seem to hook much till the very end of the travel.  We used to say that he hit the pins with so much power they fell down in fear of him!  LOL!  There were many a dent in lanes that had to be fixed after my father finished up a tournament.  While I considered a good score for me was if I could get one or two strikes a game and a score of over 100.<br><br>By the mid 1980s bowling alleys were going broke everywhere and closing their doors as it was expensive to keep them running with the low fees they charged per game.  Also family outings were far less common and young people were more into arcades than rolling ball sports.  Most proprietors made all their money on concessions, arcades and building custom balls while reducing their number of lanes by then.  The adults would go bowling while the kids would be plugging quarters in the arcade machines.  While its made a few come backs, it&#39;s never been as popular as it was prior to the early 1970s.<br><br>I think great bowlers back then would fail big time on the oiled lanes of today.  And I think pros today would fail big time on the lanes then.  There was little to no info at all out on how to actually bowl in the 1960s and 1970s.  And most lanes in smaller towns were actually built 20 years or more earlier.  Never was told that hooking the ball was going to make a difference.  My goal was just to not gutter it and hit as close to center as possible.  (We now know why I was such a bad bowler!)  And lanes weren&#39;t oiled much at all then and I think they were only waxed.  This was a very interesting video.  I had no idea that the art of bowling had become so involved with so many scientific variables and material changes of both balls, lanes, lubricants.

They actually have less friction because their rougher exteriors mean that less surface area is touching the lane.&quot;<br><br>The thing that doesn&#39;t quite add up is that frictional force is not a function of surface area or relative velocity. So theoretically, any ball of the same surface material and mass has the same frictional force regardless of roughness (as long as it can still be approximated as a sphere). When it comes to tires the extra grip from added surface area is because the tread is able to &quot;dig into&quot; the ground more, adding traction but not friction. I don&#39;t think that the tire analogy quite fits.<br><br>My guess as to why the rougher ball hooks slower in the dry area is: When the rough ball is in the oiled section the extra traction pulls it to the side as observed, but also slows down the rotation of the ball by converting some angular velocity to translational velocity and heat. When it gets to the dry section the friction makes it transition from sliding to rolling but the rolling is slower than the smooth ball would be at the same point in the lane because the smooth ball would not have bled off as much energy in the oiled section.", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T03:38:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dfailsthemost", "comment_text": "I remember those hard rubber balls.", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T03:36:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GPmaster", "comment_text": "Sounds about right.", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T03:35:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tropa Bert", "comment_text": "please help me I have assignments that are days due, I can&#39;t control my procrastination.

It&#39;s more consistent to have the ball skid to less of an angle by being slightly on the outside of the middle arrow rather than slightly inside. If you throw fast enough with enough side rotation then it&#39;s gonna hit the pins by brushing against and pushing the front pin at the same time in the side pin of the second row into the third row, while your ball will split the other side of the third row. The third row will fall in a chain reaction to the second row of pins falling and the ball hit strongly. Hitting with more angle like shown in the video might be more practically consistent IRL though maybe. But it runs the risk of cutting too much from the side into the pins because of the strong curve, and if you do hit too much from the side the second row of pins will not create the chain reaction expected. Either your pin opposite of the ball will go straight for the side without hitting the pins behind it, or the ball will cut too much and not make the side it hits from fall. By going straighter, faster and hitting stronger with more spin creates the beautiful strikes we all think of where the pins connect fast together and even fly in the air with enough spin and force. The ball can go almost straight from the arrows to the roll area and the spin will make it turn sharply and go straight again at the perfect angle of a third hitting the front pin from the right and two thirds rolling through the side pin of the second row. it&#39;s less of an arc, more force and less chance to end up in the gutter. Controlling the spin and speed accurately is something I&#39;m not capable of but I play like never irl.", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T02:05:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "redgreen09", "comment_text": "well not going see hole vid  just fist bit  yes a show called how its  made  shud  bit  fist  thing you seen  and have balls and pins  to  thay might all so  have  the lanes to  shud  dun  your  home  work", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T02:03:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "asliuf", "comment_text": "fun vid :)", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T02:02:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Clifton", "comment_text": "- OVER THE LINE!
