But to her it sounded condescending, as if I was ridiculing her, and it always ended up in a fight until she heard me on the phone helping someone with his computer problem in the same way, and she asked wasn&#39;t that person annoyed or insulted, and I said no, this helped him enormously, he understood the problem himself and fixed it himself, in the end he had a good feeling about himself because HE SOLVED IT HIMSELF, I only asked annoying parts of the whole question, turning them in to small solvable segments, providing a step by step tool to come to the full solution. She suddenly realized how getting angry wasn&#39;t helpfull at all and that I was not condescending but instead tried to teach her how to solve problems in the future, and although we are divorced for several other reasons, she managed to solve quite some complex computer problems by herself, of which i am actually proud of her and I told her this. But people who do not know this or your technique and have been ridiculed their entire life might take it as offensive simply because they aren&#39;t trained in thinking for themselves, a basic question like: &quot;Did you try turning it off and on again&quot;, can sometimes put them in a blind rage and it sounds like I think you are stupid, but this is a process often forgotten, it is a necessary step in the chain and it does need to be checked first, I do rephrase my question to &quot;You probably already tried restarting?&quot;, giving them the feeling that I think they are intelligent and that they are smart enough, and when they didn&#39;t I usually get a response like &quot;OMG why didn&#39;t I think of that, it&#39;s so simple I forgot, let&#39;s try that&quot;. <br>So maybe the thing to  help you is to rephrase some of your questions, at least you are not like Jay Leno interviewing people and only showing the dumbest people, maybe people should check him out first, now those where some &quot;Rocket scientists right there&quot;.

In reality only numbers 3 and 4 are truly correct. Numbers 1 and 2 are actually dependent on your own willingness to admit you are wrong or don&#39;t know. As was implied in the video, most of the time ignorance isn&#39;t a willful state of being, we are simply unaware that we are ignorant in the first place. The danger of this type of ignorance is that we are so unaware of our ignorance that we &quot;tune out&quot; when we assume that we already know. This is an application of confirmation bias. We have a statement or &quot;fact&quot; that we believe is true about a subject, so whenever we are asked to confirm this or are taught the subject again, we, secure in our &quot;knowledge&quot; of the subject, subconsciously don&#39;t put as much &quot;value&quot; in the discussion or lesson due to the fact that we believe it is merely reinforcing our beliefs. This is a state of close-mindedness that keeps us from learning the correct information even if we are taught it multiple times. Learning requires a state of open-mindedness and for most people this is a very difficult state to put themselves into. The entire idea of starting a lesson/video with the misconceptions is meant simply to shock us into that state of open-mindedness so that we can give our full attention to the lesson and actually learn, even if we were correct in the first place, the idea or its applications in the real world. <br><br>Another aspect of these misconceptions is to try to show us that in reality we know a lot more than we realize (number 3 from above), we just haven&#39;t been able to make the jump from the &quot;cold&quot; science to the &quot;real world application.&quot; A good example of this is one of the Veritasium videos about the temperature of a metal object vs a book. As was alluded to in the video, many people actually do know that metal is a better thermal conductor but aren&#39;t able to make the jump from the theoretical knowledge to the real world application, especially in the face of what they are experiencing, which is that when they touch the metal, it feels colder than the book.  <br><br>Finally, let&#39;s get to number 4 from above. We don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know. This is possibly the most important, yet subtle benefit of these misconception busting videos. Being shown that the world is much more complicated than we realize, or being forced to look at what we don&#39;t understand leads us down a path of questioning. Even if after watching the video and actually learning the information, by constantly being shown there is more to learn and our lack of understanding of the world around us, we begin questioning our own &quot;real world experience,&quot; why things are the way they are, and what is left to learn. These are the fundamental questions that begin any person&#39;s journey down the path towards truth. Not perceived truth but actual truth; the type that lasts forever.", "comment_date": "2017-07-14T14:32:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Name Mrname", "comment_text": "Or...<br>You can blur out their faces.<br>thats it. youre done.", "comment_date": "2017-07-14T13:38:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis R.

Humans are living beings. We need oxygen to survive and emit carbon dioxide. Animals are living beings , they need oxygen to survive and ALSO EMIT carbon dioxide. So everything which goes through respiration require oxygen and emit carbon dioxide. PLANTS ARE ALSO LIVING THINGS. THEY DO EMIT carbon dioxide BECAUSE THEY RESPIRE as OTHER LIVING BEINGS. SO THEY EMIT CO2 too. But as for preparation of their food (photosynthesis) oxygen comes out at a huge byproduct of their food synthesis that it overshadows the amount of CO2 which is also produced in the same time( daytime) because they respire. That is why people say don&#39;t keep plants in your bedroom because when you go to sleep and turn the lights off they don&#39;t synthesis their food and produce oxygen BUT ONLY RESPIRE which produces JUST Carbon dioxide !

Then instead of focusing on the fact that i failed, I started noticing the bigger picture, that teacher did not fail me or anyone out of spite, she wanted us to learn that failing and looking stupid in most cases is a good thing, that it can be a drive, and a motivation to get a deeper understanding of things.. In the end math was one of the lowest average grades i got, but due to her teachings, i was forced to look into things, to explore things that i may have not chosen to learn, had i gotten a good grade. in the end the low grades ended up meaning absolutely nothing, as i passed my State math exam with flying colors.

Some (many)) thoughts.<br>I think the main problem is not with the stupidity of people in the video, but with the content itself. (Sorry for maybe bad english)<br><br>It&#39;s true, in my opinion, that the best way to teach a person, is to ask him questions. To make him find the answer himself. And, probably, many of those people that you&#39;ve interviewed will remember what they&#39;ve learned. But... will the viewers? It is entertaining and learnable, when you&#39;re the one being asked, but you don&#39;t really ask the viewers. We just watch how other people say predictably wrong answers, while at the same time yearning for the right ones. For me it creates a feeling of frustrastion, like when you&#39;re forced to watch the whole video just for that cool stuff at the end - a topic that you brought up yourself in your video about starting youtube channel. No matter why those people act like that and how you treat it, basically, half of your videos are about wrong or stupid talk, and that&#39;s what creating the reaction I think. Half of the content is not about learning, but about unknowing. You&#39;ve probably thought about this a lot with your PHD, but maybe you should ask yourself this: how entertaining and interesting it is to watch someone giving the wrong answers, when you&#39;ve opened the video in order to hear the right ones? For me - it&#39;s not. The only thing I&#39;m learning from this is how many people there are that don&#39;t know the answers, and what can they come up with while trying to find them. And that&#39;s not what I, personally, would like to see in educational videos.<br><br>And by the way... you DID basically sad, that trees get most of their mass from carbon dioxide) You just showed us a bunch of stupid talk before that. You didn&#39;t even explain the process.<br><br>Getting back to &quot;interviewing the viewers&quot;, I like the way Mike Stevens does this. He leads the viewer from the start, asking the most basic and obvious questions FOR him - the ones that most of the pepole would have thought of themselfs - and then answers them immediately.<br><br>I like yout entusiasm, I like the energy, with which you say and do things, and I like the intent and goal of this channel.

Humans particularly remember bad, uncomfortable or scary situations as an evolutionary trait so you can avoid it in the future.<br> We also remember our desires and interests and fears over that which we care little about. Humiliation sticks in our mind more then most other things because it plays on both fear and desire. It can help you learn because of this, but it depends on who humiliates you and why. If you don&#39;t care about the subject or the people humiliating you then you are less likely to be affected. If your friend humiliates you and its a subject you care about then it will have a profound affect. This is based yet again on fear and desire. If you desire to fit in with that person, you&#39;ll adapt, if you don&#39;t you won&#39;t.

Its as simple as this, if your offended by it make your own videos proving that these answers are wrong or better yet make videos that you think would make it even easier to learn then they already  have made it... <br><br>I appreciate how you (Veritasium, Vsauce 1-3, and the many many more) have educated us and i hope you all keep up the good work!!!

If it genuinely is as you say to teach people, then I think it would be interesting to try the following strategies:<br><br>1) Pretend like you&#39;ve stopped filming. I think people can get a little bit flustered when being filmed and then they either say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or are afraid of suggesting something unintuative for fear of being wrong. You could just say &quot;Cut&quot;, but carry on the interview.<br><br>2) Pretend that you don&#39;t actually know the correct answer, but continue to ask questions. So perhaps they would say &quot;Trees are made from water, soil, and sunlight&quot; and you would reply &quot;Yeah that sounds right, but I feel that there must be something else, I am just not sure what it could be.&quot; &quot;what happens when you burn a tree?&quot;, &quot;what other things burn?&quot;, &quot;is charcoal made from trees?&quot;, &quot;what is that black sooty stuff?&quot;, &quot;do you eat carbs?&quot; &quot;what foods are good sources of carbs?&quot; &quot;do you know what the word &#39;carbs&#39; is short for?&quot;<br><br>3) Ask more different questions, In most of your interviews I see this pattern where you feel as though the interviewee is really close to the answer but they don&#39;t actually say the right word. You want them to get it right, but keep asking the same question in the hope that it will suddenly click. I think you need to ask different questions so that perhaps they look at it from a different perspective.<br><br>4) I like that you don&#39;t give away the answer, but by pretending to be dumb, I think people would be more likely to get the answer right instead of just waiting for you to tell them the answer. I think most people expect you to give them the answer in the end because of the format of the interview.
