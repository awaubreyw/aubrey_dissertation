The bootleggers would go to the mountain top and collect snow.

This was so that they could create more ice without having to transport it. They would pour almost pure ethyl alcohol onto the snow, and cover the inner container, which would freeze to solid ice. The newly made ice would then be shaved to fill several more containers to repeat the process.<br><br>The whole purpose of this was to make ice cream. <br><br>I do not believe that pressure causes the ice to melt. If you look at some of the items destroyed by ice which expands when frozen, due to the fact that water expands at any temperature, other than 40 degrees Fahrenheit its most dense state. I think that it will show that it is not pressure melting the ice. Steel can be expanded and stretched by the freezing of ice in a steel container.

Since the ice is near its melting point, I believe the wire is just trading heat back and forth with the ice. I have never tried pulling a zero degree copper wire through ice though.

I have left heavy pointed ice breaking implements on ice that was exposed to the sun, on very cold days, and they penetrated the ice with time.
