The feather &quot;catches&quot; the air because it has a lot more surface area and a lot less mass than the coin. Air is dense enough to have this effect on the feather, but not the coin. But when you kick it up a notch and do the experiment in a much thicker medium (water), the effects are more obvious. The feather would float, the coin would flutter to the bottom, and the marble would instantly fall. And the equivalent of dropping the feather and coin in a vacuum would be to remove all the water from the pool and let the marble and coin fall through nothing but air.
