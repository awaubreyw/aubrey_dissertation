He was infected by <i>analogy</i> (ok for kindergarteners)  --- with the &quot;ball rolling down inclined plane with friction&quot; classic lab.  Wrong analogy!  Obviously in <i>that</i> case GPE gets traded for both LKE and RKE.  But my physics brain told me this was not the case for the bullet + block.  In the bullet + block we have all three conservation laws always holding, since (approximately) no heat loss, no ext. force, no ext. torque.  So linear <b>p</b> has to be roughly conserved (caveats below).   The caveat is I had to assume the bullet gets lodged in the block, this was <i>not clear</i> in your vdo!!! grrr.  Also the difference in sonic + heat loss (and wood splinter loss) energy is roughly the same in both cases, i.e., negligible for the height approximate calculation.   Anyhooo, with those assumptions, the bullet + block never lose much linear <b>p</b> nor gain any extra rotational <b>L</b> , so the initial angular momentum from the centre of mass frame is conserved, so the spinning block was already inherent in the side angle attack of the bullet.  Case closed for conservation of <b>p</b> and <b>L</b> . The block has to rise about the exact same height.<br>     &quot;Ahhh,&quot; you say to me, &quot;where did the extra energy come from to rotate the block so damn fast, if the GPE gain was the same huh?  Can you answer that smarty pants?&quot;  And I can surely answer you, <i>it came from the difference in deformation damage to the block.</i>  From the side hit case the block does not take the full brunt of the bullet, it&#39;s like a pre-Awoken Neo, it dodges the bullet slightly, the bullet still wedges in, but cannot do as much kinetic damage.  I mean, go ahead, you try to wedge a bullet in an oak or pine wooden block with your hand... it ain&#39;t so easy without a direct centre hit.<br>    So this is an inelastic collision problem, not a GPE &lt;--&gt; RKE trade-off puzzle.<br>    How did I do Mum?<br>   Also, imagine the bullet hitting a steel block versus a marshmallow or jello block of the same mass... bullet still wedge in... which block will shoot up higher?  The steel block. Far more kinetic deformation damage done to the marshmallow, it&#39;ll have to be an awfully long marshmallow to keep the bullet still wedged in it, the bullet will make an extremely long core, perhaps a 100m???  Of course, it is harder by hand to dent a steel block, but that&#39;s a &quot;lever&quot; problem.  Pack all the energy you need to core a 100m long marshmallow with a long piece of dowel all at once into a steel block and the steel block will dent a tad, comparatively though a lot less deformation damage. (Actually, I&#39;d like to see this comparison, my instinct could be wrong, maybe coring a 100m long marshmallow is easy, and ignoring air friction the marshmallow might shoot up higher? You have to account for time (power) though, coring a 100m long marshmallow in a millisecond is awfully hard.)<br>      I wonder how many viewers tried it out with neodynium magnetic billiard balls on a slippery surface, or the like. Should see the same result in slower motion.<br><br>   In the case of the &quot;ball rolling down inclined plane&quot; linear <b>p</b> is not conserved because we have friction and normal forces with horizontal un-blanced components, and more un-blanced with a more slippery slope.", "comment_date": "2021-12-08T08:49:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slippery_ Gecko", "comment_text": "Not as high", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T06:06:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cubrecamarojo", "comment_text": "I think it&#39;ll go higher: the bullet will hit the side not making it tork through the center so this will make the block do a &#39;whip&quot; motion pulling it up more", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T23:28:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juliano Souza Chaves", "comment_text": "&quot;Click on one of the anotations&quot;<br>Me watching after they removed anotation: sad noises", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T19:15:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Angel Pena Rolo", "comment_text": "not as high cuz of energy conservation", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T17:26:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThunderDragon", "comment_text": "[paused] will go higher, maybe due to angular momentum", "comment_date": "2021-11-18T08:37:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Notorious M.I.G.", "comment_text": "Not as high, energy will be transferred into rotational energy", "comment_date": "2021-11-18T00:56:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KP", "comment_text": "I really dislike these clickbait titles claiming we are deficient somehow.

It makes no sense how only one block can be rotating if both systems have the same rotational momentum/energy, but in fact, the two systems never had identical rotational energy/momentum. When you realize this, the paradox disappears.\r<br>\r<br>As shown (in the explanation video), it is easy to see that the linear momentum is identical in both cases, and that alone can explain the identical height (within experimental tolerance). With the first system, there is no angular momentum, as the system&#39;s center of mass is inline with the centers of gravity of the block and bullet, and the bullet&#39;s velocity is along that same line: angular momentum is zero. \r<br>\r<br>When the bullet is fired off-center, the system is now different, and it is a mistake to assume the angular momentum is again zero. Now, the system center of mass is still in-between the block and bullet (but no longer directly below the block or above the bullet, it is off to the side), and it travels upward at a proportion of the velocity the bullet does (the CoM velocity is identical to the first case). But now the bullet velocity and block velocity (relative to the system center of mass) is not in-line with the system center of mass, therefore the starting angular momentum is not zero. This is the crucial difference from before.

(1) I knew it was going to be an unexpected answer, or you wouldn&#39;t have made this video.  :-) (2) Think about it:  In inelastic collisions (such is these), both linear and angular momentum are conserved, but kinetic energy is NOT.  Conservation of linear momentum alone predicts that the blocks will reach the same height.  Angular momentum is also conserved in that the spinning block has the exact same angular momentum as the bullet-block system just prior to collision.  But the spinning block clearly shows more kinetic energy, so how can it go as high?  In both cases (as in all inelastic collisions) kinetic energy is lost to heat.  But in the second case, the bullet is not slowed down as much (it&#39;s moving much faster in the spinning block), so less energy is lost to heat, and remains as kinetic energy.  Bottom line, conservation of momentum (and gravity, of course) is what determines the final height in both cases.<br><br>I&#39;m a little surprised that Destin (Smarter Every Day) didn&#39;t see this immediately.

As the block begins to spin, the block acts as a lever and the nail pushes downward against the plexiglass stand.  The plexiglass structure sits on solid ground, so as the nail pushes downward against it, the effective result is the nail is helping to launch the block upward (just as anything that gives the earth a downward shove will itself experience an upward acceleration). Hence the spinning block will reach about the same height as the non-spinning block, even though some energy is used toward spin acceleration instead of a directly-upward acceleration.  To prove my theory, you can do the experiment again, removing the plexiglass stand at the exact moment of bullet contact (I&#39;m not sure how this could be done).  Or more easily you can suspend the block using a squishy support structure instead of the rigid plexiglass.
