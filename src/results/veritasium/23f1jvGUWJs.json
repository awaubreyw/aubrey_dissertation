The ball moves through the air and on the bottom of the ball the fuzz(friction) on the ball is grabbing the air and moving it faster. \u00a0On the top of the ball the friction between the ball and the air is grabbing the air and throwing it against the oncoming air wizzing past the ball. \u00a0As velocity increases pressure decreases and you have a situation where high velocity but low pressure is on the bottom of the ball and higher pressure low air velocity is on the top. \u00a0The atmosphere presses down on the ball towards the low pressure causing the ball to accelerate towards the court faster than it normally would with just gravity. \u00a0The surface of the ball and the speed can also effect if the flow around the ball making it laminar or turbulent which when combined with spin can have some interesting effects. \u00a0What makes golf balls and table tennis balls different is a good example of that. One other note that most people probably caught but anyways in the video it wasn&#39;t really explained why the cylinder moves backwards after being dropped from the plank. It&#39;s be cause the body is not moving through the air horizontally but on a diagonal initially so the fastest air relative to the cylinder is on the edge that just left the plank which caused the Magnus force to push down and back + drag as well. \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T05:11:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just Revel", "comment_text": "PING PONG!!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2014-02-13T20:38:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R.Islam", "comment_text": "So its basically an application of newtons third law on spherical objects", "comment_date": "2014-02-10T15:10:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nate liebert", "comment_text": "DO AN EPISODE ON HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS!", "comment_date": "2014-01-25T20:05:45Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "likain2", "comment_text": "15 years later and you find out why soccer ball behaved like this when played in elementary school", "comment_date": "2014-01-17T17:53:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Praveen Chukka", "comment_text": "bend it like Beckham explained in 3 minutes.", "comment_date": "2013-12-16T16:33:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fabiano Caixeta Duarte J\u00fanior", "comment_text": "If you make an analogy between that magnus force and the interaction from a linear magnetic field and a round one.
