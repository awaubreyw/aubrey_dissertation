[{"comment_by": "IqbalHamid", "comment_text": "Light is ALWAYS a wave!!!  This guy goes from treating light as a wave to dictating it is a particle (photon), out of the blue, without any justification.  YES, if you insist light is fundamentally particulate, you will get nonsense when applying the particle model to an experiment that shows light is a wave.  Reducing the amplitude DOES NOT turn waves into particles as he so erroneously submits.  Low intensity light will REMAIN wavelike in nature but with low amplitude, that&#39;s all.  Hence NO PARADOX!!!  Physicists also erroneously submit that a low intensity electron beam travelling through a single slit that also yields a speckled pattern on the film (detector) are due to electrons being detected ONE at a time. How ridiculous!!!!  Do you have any idea how feint the impact of a single electron would be?  They are effectively suggesting that a chain reaction occurs in the film which blows up the impact of a single electron  so that we see SINGLE electrons.  What have these physicists been smoking?  And the mindless, unthinking public swallows whatever junk they are fed without any enquiry.  It makes more sense to interpret the specks on the film (detector) as the consequence of the quantised structure of the detection medium firing (being triggered) from the minimum intensity it can respond to.  You will ALWAYS get a speckled pattern NATURALLY when a wave beam is reduced to its lowest intensity.  You have to be a bit of a  crackpot  to believe that the specks reflect a single photon here (or a single electron when electron beams are used in the same experiment).  THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY MANY REASONS WHY I REJECT MOST MODERN INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS (ESPECIALLY COPENHAGEN)!!!! Come on world be sensible!  Have the confidence to question and challenge crackpot nonsense.  Nature is NOT probabilistic at its most fundamental level.

When you write in your introduction, referring to photons: &quot;These are indivisible particles of light&quot;. That is just plain wrong. The numerous experiments described by Richard Feynman in his excellent book QED clearly demonstrate that light is a form of energy that travels in a wavelike manner. Individual photons are thus indivisible WAVES of light - not PARTICLES of light. The fact that they come in discreet quanta of energy (correlated  to their WAVELENGTH, by the way...) does NOT imply that they have to be localized in space. These are two totally different concepts.<br><br>The term &quot;particle&quot; strongly implies locality, and that is why it is inappropriate. There is nothing local about a travelling wave of electromagnetic energy. This misconception originates, I believe, in a faulty interpretation of the results of the double-slit experiment. People see dots on the screen and interpret that as the &quot;landing spot&quot; of the photon. Which is really not what is happening. What you are seeing is not the photon; rather the spot that we detect the screen is the location of the electron that happens to have absorbed the incoming photon. Repeat: This is NOT the location of the photon - which was always a travelling wave of energy...Until the moment of its absorption.<br><br>The photon doesn&#39;t have, never had a definite location. The photon is a wave of electromagnetic energy that passed through BOTH slits (as one would expect from a wave, nothing surprising here), interfered with itself (again, similar to what a typical wave would do) and ended up being projected on the screen, covering a surface area that probably includes trillions upon trillions of distinct individual electrons... one of which happened to have absorbed the incoming photon (following some probabilistic rule expressed by the photon&#39;s wave function). That&#39;s the spot that you see: the location of the excited electron. But in all of this, never is the photon localized.

Can you understand this post on the concept of Dimp, the dimensionlesspoint,  I am struggling to explain it clearly. This from the next Musea. <br><br>1. DIMP stands for dimensionless point - DIM-ensionless P-oint . This is a single point outside the universe, that contains all light!  This is a challenging concept and difficult to even imagine. How can anything, let alone all that, be in a point without dimensions?  But it&#39;s based on what we know now.  When you understand my single concept of DIMP, the rest of these physics ideas fall into place.  So I will try to explain it in a couple of ways. Read, this section carefully!<br><br>Dimp or the dimensionless point is a single point that contains all PHOTONS.   <br>(For visual purposes, think of photons as little pieces of light.) That means Dimp contains all ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY in a single dimensionless point.  That means all light is in a single point, a point that doesn&#39;t have four dimensions, or three, or two, or even one! Pauli&#39;s Exclusion Principle is a clue. It says all photons ( a type of boson), can be in one point while their counterpart, fermions, cannot. Remember a PHOTON DOES NOT OCCUPY SPACE! There is no limit to how many can occupy the same quantum state. Photons, all of them, can be in a single point!<br> <br>By definition we know that photons are outside of time and distance.  Infinite time dilation (no time) goes hand in hand with infinite length contraction (no distance to the destination). Because a photon is outside time, it is eternal. Because a photon is outside distance, there is no distance between any two photons. They are all together in an eternal point. They share a dimensionless point! That means all light is in one point.<br><br>If there is no distance than photons are everywhere at once - or everywhere at once and back!  That means that the  photons in the singularity that started the big bang and our entire universe, are here now today, and will be here forever in the future. <br><br>Here&#39;s an official quote from Physics  org: From the perspective of a photon, there is no such thing as time... It doesn&#39;t experience distance either. <br><br>My idea that all light energy is gathered in Dimp, a single dimensionless point, eternal and outside of space-time, is not easy to comprehend. Let&#39;s try this visual analogy. Look at photons, not as individual particles or waves of light, but as a quantum ENERGY FIELD that is everywhere at once, a BLANKET OF LIGHT that surrounds everything in the universe and is in every part of space time at the same time.  Still with me?<br><br>Because Dimp is eternal and outside time; that means Dimp is these things: <br>1. Here before the Big Bang, during the Big Bang, and here long after this universe will have ended. A vast reservoir of all energy. And our universe, where there is space and time, is a small subset of Dimp, just as an ember is a small subset of a massive bonfire. <br><br>Dimp was the singularity, the dimensionless point, that the Big Bang exploded out of. That means Dimp is separate from, not only time and distance, but gravity, mass, space, you name it! There is no acceleration in DIMP therefore no gravity!. There is no expansion in DIMP and no charge. Further the virtually endless amount of energy in Dimp never changes.  That is some weird point!<br><br>Dimp, the dimensionless point concept seems to explain all the following separate concepts; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT, ZERO POINT ENERGY, VIRTUAL PARTICLES, ENTANGLEMENT OR &#39;SPOOKY ACTION AT A DISTANCE&#39;, AND VACUUM ENERGY.<br><br>Dimp also means the  electromagnetic force and force of gravity (see later) are not connected. They are separate and can&#39;t be unified. <br><br>The  simplest way to explain Dimp is to start by saying, there are TWO UNIVERSES.  <br>THE FIRST UNIVERSE is DIMP, the dimensionless point, or the universe of photons, light, and energy, where everything that is, goes the &quot;speed of light&quot;.  <br>THE SECOND UNIVERSE is SPACE - TIME where everything goes slower than the speed of light. This is the universe of everything that is - BUT photons. <br>Nothing in Dimp goes slower than the speed of light.  Nothing in the universe goes the speed of light.  Does that help clarify? BUT WAIT, it gets more strange...<br><br>The problem is that to have a &quot;speed of light&quot; one has to have both time and distance. But a photon from it&#39;s point of view is outside of both time and distance. From our space-time point of view it looks like photons are going a set distance in a set time, but that is our illusion, not their fact. So &quot;speed of light&quot; is a misnomer.  More about this puzzle later.<br>.<br>Physics often uncovers a dark zone of unexplained phenomenon. Dimp may help explain those dark zones including:<br>1. The singularity where the big bang began.<br>2. Dimp, the dimensionless point of all photons, all light.<br>3. The dark area in an atom during a quantum jump where the electron instantly jumps over, when it jumps from shell to shell. &quot; Everything in the quantum mechanical universe ... happens in quantum leaps. A quantum leap is a discontinuous transit between quantum states - an electron jumps instantly into another energy level... There is no in between state and it doesn&#39;t take anytime for the leap to occur.&quot; Moring.<br>4. The empty zone in an atom where the electron orbital is not.<br>5. The Two Slit Experiment black bands where no particles/waves land.<br>6. The nodes of waves where the particle probability is zero.<br>7.  When two mirror image waves collide, constructive interference occurs which annihilates both waves, and turns them into pure energy. Dimp is that pure energy.<br>8.  Virtual Particles where particle A and Particle B pop up out of the void, then come together and there is total annihilation.<br>9.  Quantum tunneling? The space between when Particle A disappears on one side and materializes on the other side.<br>10. Entangled particles where A and  B are strangely and instantly connected no matter the distance between them.<br>11. Force carriers.<br>12. the infinities that renormalization tries to fix. With Dimp they are correct as is.<br>13.  Wheeler&#39;s Great Smoky Dragon analogy, where A is the head of the dragon, B is the tail of the dragon and the area between is smoke.<br>14. The 120 orders of magnitude of the vacuum energy density or cosmological constant.<br>15. Non locality may also be explained by Dimp which is outside of time and space.<br><br>Where is Dimp?  Everywhere that there is vacuum energy or space, or everywhere!That&#39;s because any surface not at absolute zero emits photons, and absolute zero can&#39;t be reached. It&quot;s both outside and inside space time! But wait - more weirdness:<br><br>PHOTONS DON&#39;T GO ANYWHERE.  Remember the speed of light problem? Photons do not move out of dimp! If they did they would have time and distance, which they do not!  Photons pop out of Dimp. They are created out of Dimp and return to Dimp. Text books say, the only interactions a photon has, are to be created or destroyed. We see a photon being created or destroyed, but nothing in between! Through pair conversion they send MESSENGERS: Electron / Positron pairs as the energy to do the work . That suggests that electrons and positrons are vehicles for photon energy!  That means when a photon pops up in our universe, it does so only as an electron / positron pair!<br><br>We know that as an object approaches the speed of light it: becomes heavier and approaches infinite mass, (Infinite mass is also infinite energy,  E=MC2). It contracts in length, and time slows. Could that object keep going faster, it would reach the speed of light and be outside of time and be eternal.  SO if mass could go the speed of light (and it can only approach it) it would be infinite energy with no length in a single dimensionless point, outside of time! Sound familiar? That is DIMP!<br><br>Totally confused?

Does a photon transfer spatial curvature from one location to another? Wrap a piece of wire around a pencil and it can produce a 3D coil of wire, much like a spring. When viewed from the side it can look like a two-dimensional sine wave. You could coil the wire with either a right-hand twist, or with a left-hand twist. Could Planck&#39;s Constant be proportional to the twist cycles. A photon with a higher frequency has more energy. (More spatial curvature). What if gluons are actually made up of these twisted tubes which become entangled with other tubes to produce quarks. (In the same way twisted electrical extension cords can become entangled.) Therefore, the gluons are actually a part of the quarks. Mesons are made up of two entangled tubes (Quarks/Gluons), while protons and neutrons would be made up of three entangled tubes. (Quarks/Gluons) The &quot;Color Force&quot; would be related to the XYZ coordinates (orientation) of entanglement. &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot;, and &quot;flux tubes&quot; make sense based on this concept. Neutrinos would be made up of a twisted torus (like a twisted donut) within this model. Gravity is a result of a very small curvature imbalance within atoms. (This is why the force of gravity is so small.) Instead of attempting to explain matter as &quot;particles&quot;, this concept attempts to explain matter more in the manner of our current understanding of the space-time curvature of gravity. If an electron has qualities of both a particle and a wave, it cannot be either one. It must be something else.

Beta decay occurs when the tube of a down quark/gluon in a neutron becomes overtwisted and breaks producing a twisted torus (neutrino) and an up quark, and the ejected electron. The phenomenon of Supercoiling involving twist and writhe cycles may reveal how overtwisted quarks can produce these new particles.

So the emitter should aim at each slit one at a time and changing its position each time depending on which slit it is aiming. This way there is no way that each photon will land outside of the trajectory between the emitter, the slit and the target spot on the screen, thereby no wave function.<br>It seems to me the device is very rough. The diameter of the light beam must be slightly wider that the area of the two slits occupy, to create that wave pattern.  But when shooting just one photon, the experimenter must be able to control the exact trajectory of that single photon so that one can know which slit the photon is going through. And the diameter of the light beam is the diameter of one photon. This way, it is unlikely to have the wave function.", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T15:50:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duderama 67", "comment_text": "The answer is simple, there are no particles, only waves.<br>Matter is the conjunction of many waves.

If every photon shot has a slightly different trajectory then it\u2019s easy to understand the resultant wave like pattern even when shot one at a time. I\u2019m guessing you probably have no idea if the photons shot out of your photon emitter have identical trajectories. The key to solving this whole baffling experiment comes down to particle trajectory. Science believes you can\u2019t make something macroscopic like a tennis ball have quantum wave like properties but I believe you can. Here&#39;s how to make a macroscopic particle like a tennis ball have wave like properties like a photon in the double slit experiment and why photons \u201cappear\u201d to lose their wave properties when observed - it all comes down to trajectory. One water molecule cannot make a wave-of-water and a trillion-trillion water molecules cannot make a wave-of-water if all the molecules follow the same trajectory. When a 500 nm wavelength photon is emitted through a double slit (with the slit material being 1mm thick) the slit plays out as a tunnel because it is approximately 2,000 times longer than the photon&#39;s wavelength. By quantum law - an electron in its molecular orbit will have a cloud like location probability - therefore the probability of a photon being emitted from an electron&#39;s orbit at the same place twice is highly unlikely. This means when photons are emitted from a stationary atom/molecule each photon has a high probability of having their own unique trajectory. Hence, when photons are shot through the slit/tunnel in the double slit experiment each respective photon will hit, bounce, and ricochet off the inside of the slit/tunnel at a different location. This means all the photons will exit the slit/tunnel with slightly different trajectories and consequently impact the back-wall in a &quot;wave&quot; like pattern representative of the electron&#39;s orbital cloud. So how do we get all the photons emitted from different locations with slightly different trajectories to hit the back-wall in the same spot? Simple - we observe them. In other words the act of observing/measuring a photon doesn&#39;t necessarily collapse its intrinsic wave property but our observing/measuring device due to its fixed location will &quot;funnel&quot; or \u201cshute\u201d all the different photon trajectories into a singular common path/trajectory before they enter the slit/tunnel. And if all photons enter the slit/tunnel with identical trajectories then they should all exit with identical trajectories and impact the back-wall in the same spot. The shute/funnel consequence is the same when we place our detection device after the slit. So if we want macroscopic tennis balls to produce wave like properties we would need to set up our double slit tennis ball experiment in similar ways - and proportions - to our double slit photon experiment. A tennis ball is approximately 2.575 inches in diameter. Therefore, the board for our tennis ball slits would need to be approximately 430 feet thick (2,000 x 2.575&quot;). We would also have to make our tennis ball shooter have a randomized cloud location like an electron\u2019s molecular orbit. This will give the tennis balls random trajectories but because of the shooting apparatus\u2019s electron cloud location mimicking nature - high, low and no probability trajectories will emerge and the tennis balls will eventually produce wave like patterns where the tennis balls strike the back-wall. But again, it\u2019s not the tennis balls themselves that have the wave like properties - it\u2019s the electron cloud like location property of the tennis ball shooter giving the tennis balls many different trajectories of high, low and no probability which along with the mathematical corralling nature of the slits produce wave like patterns.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T05:22:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kurito hekusa", "comment_text": "If Light was a Particle, wouldn&#39;t it also stay at rest, once it hit hit some surface.

A photon resonates with the electrons of the outermost atoms of each slits edges. The addition of the charge of a photon sets up charge currents in the material where the slits are made or in the standing waves photons as in a synthetic slit consisting of energetic particle beams. That extra charge causes all of the electrons close to the atoms that captured a photon, to resonate the same, at any time this happens since the same set of atoms and their electrons are in the same over all positions over long lengths of time. So no matter when a photon is captured at any to the 4 slit edges, the same resonance acts on any photon. That then makes the photon leaving the slit to get bunched up , very similar to how air molecules bunch up to propagate a &quot;wave&quot;  of sound, pushed together which causes other paths to have less photons and then continue towards the far field bunched up into that pattern of more or less photon to make the pattern of bright and dark bars. The same resonance acting at the slits is what redistributed the photons into varying concentrations from a maximum towards the bright spots and no photons towards the the dark bars. There cannot be any such thing as destructive interference since, energy cannot be destroyed no matter the mechanism, be that photons or any other energetic particle. No waves required in the way it has so long been assumed. Those waves were never proven or demonstrated as being in existence. What was used to make that assumptions were observed waves, but only at the macroscopic level, such as waves on water. Under the surface, the water is turning in long cylinders. The top or surface part,  seen as waves, is just an artifact of the whole mechanism. The photon is much more accurately modelled like the rotating cylinders but, in all directions. to form a sphere of charge currents. Experiments purporting to have waves involved, were interpreted as existing by, first arranging equipment of the experiment as if the equipment was handling waves and then had the results of those experiments interpreted under the same assumption that the waves were acting in those same parts of the experiment. So set up the experiment by considering the waves as not there but as outlined in this comment, and see if the same experiment can be interpreted as acting similarly as outlined. It is all in how accurately one sees the topology the photon being modelled and and from there what the other parts of the experiment should be seen doing before the experiment is setup, or run or interpreted of its results. <br>Take away. It is all about how accurate the model of charged particle is. The more accurate, the less need to go into imagining weird things, like uncertainty. Without uncertainty, no need for entanglement and from there no way to construct q-bits. That is how to explain why q-bits keep decohering or stop being entangled in more than one state. The waves, at base of all that, are just modelled too inaccurately, is all. <br><br>No need to blow a fuse or mind, as some want to say when the experiment is hard to understand. Understood?

I\u2019ve often thought about the complexity of the interference pattern generated by all of the luminous objects in space. This is where I\u2019m at... So we think of space as an empty vacuum with nothing in it. But it\u2019s not. Every single object from the size of a Planck length to the size of the Great Attractors emit all sorts of energy along a spectrum which probably goes beyond what our feeble machines can detect. To make the concept I\u2019m about to explain easier to understand, let\u2019s just think of the visible light emitted from stars for a moment. When you look up at a star you see this tiny point of light billions of miles away. Now when you step to the side one step, it\u2019s still there. That\u2019s because that star is emitting that light in all directions at once. All of the stars are doing this. This information is emitted as very small quantized packets of information at incredible rates of frequency. Our brains operate at a relatively slow rate of frequency so it appears  like a steady stream of light. (The twinkling is just interference from our atmosphere.) These packets of information are separated by \u201cnothing\u201d which is actually not \u201cnothing,\u201d it\u2019s the multitude of information packets from other stars. This causes there to be a gradient of information between packets - a gradient which produces electromagnetism - the fundamental base layer of the universe. Side note: \u201cnothing\u201d is the same as \u201ceverything\u201d but without any differences between its constituents ie: no gradients. So as these intense electromagnetic waves from one star meet the intense electromagnetic waves from all the other stars of varying distances and intensities in the space between the stars, they inevitably create peaks and valleys in this vastly complex gradient interference pattern. Now, because we are talking about 3-dimensional space and not the surface of water, these high and low spots translate into an interconnected web of points which I suspect would look much like our neural network or a mycelial fungal network or pretty much any network naturally occurring in nature which communicates information. With some of these points being \u201clarger\u201d or more intense than others you\u2019ll actually get electromagnetic currents forming and flowing between the stars. It may even have a gravitational pull associated with it. One way to think of the currents in this network is to think of how our atmosphere moves by getting pulled from low pressure areas to high pressure areas. Side note: a hunch of mine is the net negative areas (spots where multiple low levels in the waves meet) are where you\u2019ll find what we call dark energy. You know, that mysterious force which we can\u2019t detect and seems to have no apparent reason for being there other than it must because there seems to be more gravity than there are solid masses to product it. Another hunch I have is that this naturally occurring network is fractal in nature. That is, it exists at the smallest level thinkable (the one that\u2019s flowing through your mind and body as you read this) and the ultimate largest level we call the universe Each smaller network becoming a part of the next greater whole in succession. Now since the universe contains all the information within it (duh) and that information is communicated throughout it in a way which resembles our own neural network... the universe is an all-knowing, omnipresent, conscious being! Now if your mind isn\u2019t completely blown just yet please consider this; You are contributing to the information held within this network right now because your brain, heart and body is generating its own magnetic field. We are all luminous beings capable of generating and communicating completely unique information just by sitting there and being!

But if you think deeply about those ideas, it is NOT absolutely necessarry to require light be quantised to explain those phenomenon:  Briefly, this is because: We know electron energy levels in matter are quantised.  If we accept this, then surely, SURELY, any interaction of light with matter, such as in the photoelectric effect, will also reveal quantised energies.  But it is crucial to understand that this is because electron energy levels in matter are quantised and NOT because light strikes metal as quantised photons (and yes, emr energy is still proportional to its frequency.).<br><br>So light is ALWAYS a wave and NEVER a photon.  The sensor, I bet, works by dividing energy it senses by hf. <br><br>So, moving forward, if light is a wave and all you are doing in this experiment is reducing its intensity, well of course you will still get an interference pattern at the sensor, albeit so feint that its successful detection at any specific point becomes subject to  chance. <br><br>Proof:  Take a look at the results after 1 second of shining the laser as presented @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzbKb59my3U&amp;t=2m59s\">2:59</a>. <br><br>If you have blinkered vision or an inpressionable mind, you will see what you are told by the presenter.<br><br>However, if you have an ounce of common sense you will interpret the output @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzbKb59my3U&amp;t=2m59s\">2:59</a> as nothing more than the feint interference pattern it clearly is.

Ben Schumacher gives two &quot;rules of thumb&quot; during the 4th lecture of his series on Quantum Mechanics: &quot;light travels as a wave&quot; and &quot;light is absorbed like a particle;&quot; in other words light does NOT travel like a particle.  Don Eisner of IBM (famous for making images of atoms using tunneling electron microscopy) said wave-particle duality is just &quot;mumbo jumbo&quot; and it&#39;s more sensible to think entirely in terms of waves.  An alternative model that doesn&#39;t involve traveling particles is that a wave is &quot;self-entangled,&quot; so that absorption somewhere immediately reduces the wave to zero everywhere.<br><br>The easiest kind of experiment with which to think about these issues is an interferometer with a half-silvered mirror that splits a light beam in two, with each half directed at one of two detectors.  The observed result is that each quantum of light is detected at one of the detectors.  In the orthodox photon particle model, there&#39;s a 50/50 chance that the mirror directs the photon along one path or the other, so that it ends up being absorbed by the detector at the end of the path.  In the &quot;self-entangled wave&quot; model, the split wave travels both paths and its quantized absorption at one of the detectors causes it to be zeroed everywhere and thus not absorbed at the other detector.  With the orthodox model, the Delayed Choice experiment seems to require some kind of phenomenon that travels backward in time, but that&#39;s not necessary given the self-entangled wave model.<br><br>It should be noted that, according to quantum field theory, a particle is just a convenient linguistic shorthand that refers to a vibration of a quantum field.

Much like with sound, there are points of high and low density in the concentration of particles. The particles themselves are also moving forward in the same direction as the wave, and it is the incredible speed of the particles that make it difficult to differentiate between the types of movement.  Since photons move at slightly less than C, there is still enough of a difference between the two types of movement (linear and wave) that this doesn&#39;t seem impossible.  The information represented by the wave can translate at exactly C, while the photons themselves are slightly limited by the energy representing an infinitesimally small mass.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve explained this very well, but am I entirely wrong in the way I understand this?  It sounds like you&#39;re saying they couldn&#39;t possibly exist in both states at the same time, but it still doesn&#39;t seem unlikely.  A wave is just a method of travel, a contracting and separating of particles.  It&#39;s hard to visualize something that both moves forward and has an elasticity of speed that would allow for wave propogation, but I&#39;m nowhere near adept enough with mathematics to validate or disprove the possibility.<br><br>I hope I haven&#39;t taken too much of your time with an inane question.

Have you ever noticed how shadows kinda stick to each other at the point of connection and separation? Does it mean that light particles (photons) at the edges of the shadow are getting deflected away from their original paths because of the objects interfering with them causing this absence of light in that area, like an nonrepresentational shadow (sticking effect) if something like that exists? If gravitational lensing proves light can bend and deflect doesn&#39;t that mean it also occurs here but on a much smaller scale like in this 2x slit experiment?<br><br>What if it&#39;s actually the material the slit is comprised of that&#39;s causing this predictable interference pattern. <br>2. Can it be possible that as the photon enters the slit, it&#39;s trajectory is effected purely by the close proximity of the photon to the slit walls which attracts and deflects the photon diverting their paths. Can it be possible for the slits material to exert some force on the atomic scale to said photon like the shadow effect above in point 1?<br><br>a. Lets imagine we could increase and decrease the speed of each individual photon precisely. If the above was true and we reduced the speed the pattern would widen (without adjusting the slit opening) because, as the slowed down photon passes through the slit, the effects of the slits material (energy) on the photon would be able to impart a greater deflection because we know objects like moving in a straight line and the faster they move the harder it is to deflect them. If it were possible to increase the speed of light the pattern would/ should tighten? <br><br>3. Is it possible in an abstract way to create this slit experiment but with no slit actually present (I know this sounds silly but this would prove or disprove the effects of matters on close passing photons trajectory I postulated) just to see if the material is having an effect on photons. <br><br>4.
