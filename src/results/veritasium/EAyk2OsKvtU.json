Now for the bad news, In reference to this signal( gravitational wave) here is something to consider LIGO False positive; the problem is that the methods used to Extract the signal From a sea of noise and the interpretation of such a signal signal. The signal amplitude is smaller then a atomic nuclei a it must be filtered out from a sea of noise, the methods used is highly dubious, because the investigator introduces a predetermined template comparator that may introduce a bias in these extractions (observations). Furthermore, the filtering processing requires a inordinate amount of data processor or data comparison in Searching for the predetermined signature of a chirps, which starts with a low and moves to a higher frequency, may also be the characteristics of many other natural phenomena, not related to gravity. There is also another problem, interpretation of the source, at is, to associate the Signal (chirps) with a Specific cosmic events (Gamma burst, x-ray emissions).

Of these, the causes and effects it is the most problematic where the narrative does not have a connecting principle, but instead it is  artificially juxtaposed by the mind and not real.

Here is an argument; in general relativity the equation called the Lorenz transform <a href=\"https://goo.gl/images/5vrm6H\">https://goo.gl/images/5vrm6H</a> is used to calculate the limits of mass acceleration which basically is one over  square root of 1- v/c  where v= velocity of the moving object and c= Universal speed of light , note when v  approaches the velocity of light the ratio v/c will  equals 1 therefore the divisor becomes Zero, that is, you are dividing by zero (infinity is the result), which According to the theory of relativity means matter cannot be accelerated to the speed of light, or matter can not Exceed the speed of light, it is prohibited, because you cannot divide by zero (which would yield infinities). And this is perfectly reasonable argument, because this has been confirmed by particles accelerators, incidentally the discipline of particle physics which also interprets infinities results as a Indicator of an incorrect theory. But in black hole Schwarzschild equation which states the radius of the Events horizon ~ 1/(r x c^2) where r is the radius of the singularity which equals zero when black hole status is reached, we have a mathematical scenario which we are Again dividing by zero. And yet this is interpreted as acceptable, this infinity would allows matter to be compressed to infinity, a preposterous  interpretation.

Second because if such gravitational waves exist, these researcher will be not able to detect them because the gravitational field must propagate through the physical vacuum of cosmic space with such speed that makes possible the condition when one physical object in the universe change its impulse, all other physical objects in it to register this change and to change their impulses accordingly almost instantaneously. This is necessary condition the great structures in the universe to be able to preserve their form, organization an movement for a long period of time. Otherwise the integrity of the large structures in the universe such as solar systems, galaxies or galaxy clusters will be impossible for long period of time. For example each moving part in one mechanism must be synchronized with the other moving parts so that it can maintain its integrity and functionality over time. This synchronization needs instant connection between all moving parts. <br>Third because the existence of neutron stars is only theoretical. No one is able to confirm the existence of such object in the universe. In fact the scientists are able only to detect large fast rotating cosmic magnets with unknown nature. <br>According to theorists, the neutron stars are called so because, due to the intensity of their gravity, the electrons and protons residing in the atomic nuclei of the matter they contain, unite together and form neutrons. By its very nature, this theoretical stars type represents a huge atomic nucleus containing only neutrons. The problem is that to be able such kind of star to have strong magnetic field, there must be free electrons in its interior and an electric field to make these electrons move in a certain direction if its magnetic field is caused by strong electrical currents. Or it must contain stable over time magnetic polarization - both impossible by the fact that this star does not have free electrons by definition. Actually the true nature of these objects remains unclear to us.<br><br>Why GR theory is wrong from the beginning? The reason is easily understandable and intuitive. <br>First because the stable over time order in the physical and social systems can not be defined and supported without the absolutes independent from the time and the position in space. This is the reason why people use universal measures and weights, and international standards in everyday life and engineering activities, which are local absolutes, to prevent the chaos in these areas of life. Imagine the chaos that will happen if everyone begins to measure with his own moral or physical measure.<br>Second because the mathematical apparatus of GR theory does not deal with the real physical space which have physical properties and limitations and which propagates the electromagnetic waves, fields, fundamental force interactions and elementary particles, but with some king of magical infinitely elastic space without such properties and limitations which can be arbitrary bended, twisted and stretches as geometric manifold without to loose its properties. <br>Third because is not fully mathematically correct because there is situation with the division by zero. It this situation the proponent of this theory claim, that the fabric of space collapses at the singular point, where no physical laws can be applied. Actually the only real thing that collapses at this situation is their own insubstantial theory. <br>This is the reason why the GR theory is not compatible with the physical theories. So every derivatives of GR metaphysical theory do not deserve the scientific discussion. Actually this theory is invented by people whose wants to represent and justify the moral relativism in society, which is lawlessness, as something that naturally occurs in the nature. <br>The GR theory is contra intuitive because is in conflict with the logic and our empirical experience.", "comment_date": "2017-10-24T08:51:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raymond K Petry", "comment_text": "Raymond K Petry 6 days ago<br>Are any of those heavy elements deemed necessary to bio-life...might give us a clue to earliest man in the universe....", "comment_date": "2017-10-24T00:22:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "D P", "comment_text": "can we create Gravitational waves here on earth ?", "comment_date": "2017-10-23T19:11:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik 567", "comment_text": "Best graphic explanation so far I&#39;ve seen.

Weber bars[edit]A simple device to detect the expected wave motion is called a Weber bar \u2013 a large, solid bar of metal isolated from outside vibrations. This type of instrument was the first type of gravitational-wave detector. Strains in space due to an incident gravitational wave excite the bar&#39;s resonant frequency and could thus be amplified to detectable levels. Conceivably, a nearby supernova might be strong enough to be seen without resonant amplification. Modern forms of the Weber bar are still operated, cryogenically cooled, with superconducting quantum interference devices to detect vibration (see for example, ALLEGRO). Weber bars are not sensitive enough to detect anything but extremely powerful gravitational waves.[8]MiniGRAIL is a spherical gravitational-wave antenna using this principle. It is based at Leiden University, consisting of an exactingly machined 1150\u00a0kg sphere cryogenically cooled to 20 mK.[9] The spherical configuration allows for equal sensitivity in all directions, and is somewhat experimentally simpler than larger linear devices requiring high vacuum. Events are detected by measuring deformation of the detector sphere. MiniGRAIL is highly sensitive in the 2\u20134\u00a0kHz range, suitable for detecting gravitational waves from rotating neutron star instabilities or small black hole mergers.[10]AURIGA is an ultracryogenic resonant bar gravitational wave detector based at INFN in Italy. It is based on a cylindrical bar detector. The AURIGA and LIGO teams have collaborated in joint observations.[11]Wonder if one of these rigs picked up this latest event.", "comment_date": "2017-10-17T16:14:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Niroj B.

If the stars or black holes are rotating around each other, they are alternately closer and farther from us. This is a variance in our proximity to the densities. This was discovered when small low orbiting satellites about the moon had a tendency to crash. Low orbits around the moon are unstable because the density of the moon varies so much. The spacecraft will pass over alternately denser and lighter areas, and you could call this a &quot;wave&quot; of sorts, not emanating from the moon as much as the craft passes in and out of the zones. To me a gravitational wave of real significance would be a stable, homogeneous  mass with a relatively constant mass presentation and distance would have some sort of wave associated with the gravity itself, not related to its varying proximity and or mass. This is like saying a permanent magnet has magnetic &quot;waves&quot; if you spin it. No, you&#39;re just varying the presentation to the detector, as the poles pass into alignment with it, it detects a varying magnetism, in contrast to an a/c energized electromagnet which actually does have a varying field.", "comment_date": "2017-10-17T08:33:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Douken", "comment_text": "This is annoying to me.

Neutron stars?   You do know neutrons do not bond for more than a few minutes and even then a proton is required.   There is no empirical evidence that a neutron star could even exist and anyone with a basic knowledge in science can know this.   Neutron stars are an unproven hypothesis yet just like a parrot you repeat it as if it is an observed and tested fact, yet it is neither.   The only reason this absurd theory arose is because of the absurd affection for Einsteinian gravity limited the capacity of astronomical physicists to theorize upon what a pulsar is, as well, they want to neutrlize the electric force even though it is several billion times stronger than gravity.   Give a man only a hammer and everything he sees is a nail.<br><br>If one included electricity and plasma within their models, especially considering the electric field is stronger than the gravitational field and plasma constitutes 99% of the observeable universe, then there are simple and rational explanations for a pulsar that do not require fantastical unproven hypothesis to explain.  Pulsars are likely an electrical event, consider the simple circuit required to make a strobe light.   Black holes, which based on their math could not exist in a big bang universe, are likely plasmoids as plasma physicists have onserved in a lab.<br><br>I suggest you OPEN YOUR MIND to alternative theories and learn to think for yourself, as clearly you are not.

And as far as gravity bending light around stars.  Funny that it only happens within the corona(plasma atmosphere) of the star, never outside of the corona which suggests atmospheric refraction and not gravity bending light, and for the record I am indifferent to Einstein, I neither hate him nor do I love him, I am merely following the data, am critical of fantastical claims and much like Einstein, driven by curiosity.", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T21:21:57Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Maximilian Kummer", "comment_text": "Do something about the Pauli exclusion principle.", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T21:20:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "syg B.", "comment_text": "all that from this tiny hell ball in the milky way<br>we observe things that we can mostly never be able travel too", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T21:19:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "POLICE MATRIX", "comment_text": "lol what a joke this is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SFJjrD5pq_I\">https://youtu.be/SFJjrD5pq_I</a> wake up people there is still time", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T21:19:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luda", "comment_text": "this is just hilarious and totally wrong..
