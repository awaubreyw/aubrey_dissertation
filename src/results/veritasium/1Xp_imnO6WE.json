It is not due to variation in density of the phone&#39;s mass distribution.  The same trick will work with a book (held shut with a rubber band), a claw hammer, or any object where its three principal moments of inertia are all different.  Let&#39;s call them Ix, Iy and Iz and  Ix &lt; Iy &lt; Iz.  Here, &quot;I&quot; is the upper case, first letter in the word &#39;Inertia&#39;.  Consider a set of x, y and z axes that run through the phone.  Before the phone is flipped, the x-axis aligns with the longest dimension of the phone and passes through its center.  The z-axis  aligns with the vertical axis, or parallel to the thinnest dimension of the phone.  The y-axis aligns with the middle or intermediate dimension of the phone.  Due to the phone&#39;s (more or less) constant mass density, Ix &lt; Iy &lt; Iz.  Rotations about the x and z axes are stable.  Rotations about the axis that corresponds to the intermediate (or middle value) of the phone&#39;s moment of inertia (Iy) is inherently unstable.  Unconstrained rotation about the y-axis picks up some rotation about the x-axis.  Why?  Some may not like this explanation, but here it is.  Solving Lagrange&#39;s equation for a rotating rigid body leads to a set of three equations called Euler&#39;s equations.  Applying small perturbations to the object&#39;s angular velocity and substituting that into Euler&#39;s equations gives a 2nd order differential equation in the perturbation parameter.  Solving that differential equation shows the perturbation will oscillate with an angular frequency.  In a manner of speaking, this isn&#39;t so &quot;bad&quot; as long as the oscillations don&#39;t grow.  However, the expression for the angular frequency when the object rotates about the axis that has the intermediate moment of inertia, involves (among other things) the square root of (Iy-Iz).   Iz is the largest moment of inertia, and Iy minus Iz is a negative number.  The square root of a negative number is an imaginary number.  Physically, this means the amplitude of those perturbing oscillations will grow without limit leading to an unstable rotation.  See section 12 in chapter 11 in &quot;Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems&quot; 5th edition by Thornton and Marion.  That book contains a paragraph describing how NASA and its astronauts overcame the same instability when they tried to grapple a communications satellite with the Space Shuttle in 1992.", "comment_date": "2022-08-11T14:59:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melika rj", "comment_text": "..", "comment_date": "2022-08-08T17:12:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gameknight", "comment_text": "The reason why #1 works isn\u2019t just because of the method, but because in the first case you only have one finger; the center of mass is always a point, and since you\u2019ve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane, there is effectively a 0% chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point, and thus starts leaning towards one side or another.<br><br>If you use the second method, there\u2019s two points of contact, and thus as long as the center of mass is in-between, it cannot tilt.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

Nonetheless, I&#39;m going to take an intuitive stab at explaining the phenomena:  1) The cane:  It&#39;s difficult to see the center of gravity with your eyes, but you can feel it with your body or in this case, the balance of the cane on your arms. It&#39;s not dissimilar to our sense of balance allowing us to walk, stand and/or run without falling over.  When you start out with your hands apart and move them together, you&#39;re continually balancing the cane and making adjustments  accordingly. 2) phone flipping:  I couldn&#39;t quite see how you were flipping the phone but I gather you were flipping the phone along its narrowest dimension - like a discus-- which I guess would be its depth. This way all of the phone&#39;s mass would stay within a narrow plane.  Flipping it width wise or length wise would introduce a much wider plane and more instability. 3) Cup bending a stream of water:  I think the running water might have been creating a weak magnetic field which was attracted to the static cup. 4) Magnetic cereal: Somewhat similar to the previous.  The strong magnet created a mini-dimple in the surface of the water just in the middle of that cheerio which dragged it along 5)  Tea Bag Rocket:  As you lit that tea bag rocket as it burned down it was heating a column of air. Hot air rises (e.g. a hot hair balloons).   When the flame finally hit the plate, an elevator of hot air had been created sweeping up the remnants of the tea bag almost like suction.

The math is somewhat complicated, but essentially it shows that there is no stable spinning about that axis for a rectangle shaped object.  Sorry I can&#39;t be more specific, but suffice to say, it&#39;s in the math.  It has to do with the moment of inertia tensor. and gravity.  The cane trick is, as far as I can figure, due to you.  As you move your fingers closer together you move the fingers so the cane does not tip. and as you get closer you must move your fingers to the center of mass or the cane will fall.  So it is a result of your carefully moving your fingers so the cane does not flip. The tea bag rocket takes off when the tea bag is at the end of the burn.  As it burns it creates an upward current of air, and when there is sufficiently little mass left, the currents carry it off.  For the cereal, there is iron in most cereals and this is attracted to the magnet.  Take total cereal (high iron content).  Put it in water until it turns to mush.  mix it with a fork, and put a magnet in the goop.  after a short time you will see very small flakes of iron on the magnet.  I am not sure of the cup Phenomena.  I would like to see the experiment done with a non charged cup.  If it still deflects, it is not the charge on the cup, but most likely an interaction of the air being carried down with the water.  Such an effect is called the Coanda effect.

When we move our fingers from the ends towards the centre of the hammers or stuff like that, we are essentially heading towards the centre of mass by keeping an equal value of mass* displacement from the centre of mass if we keep balancing simultaneously. Thus, no matter what our speed is or from where we start, we end up at the centre of mass.<br>2. The phone rotates asymmetrically because inside the phone the chips are inserted on one side and most of the stuffs like motherboard are the on one side that makes it heavier on one side and thus a shift of COM(Centre of Mass) happens. This can also be realised by observing the phenimenon of heating in mobile phones which is more inclined on one side.<br>3. Water in itself is diamagnetic as all the electrons are paired(considering the MOT(Molecular Orbital Theory) model), which indicates that it should not be affected by electric or magnetic fields. But the water that runs through our taps are not simply distilled water. It has some added minerals which induces magnetic behaviour in tap water. Thus, the plastic cup that is charged by rubbing against hair, results in accumulation of electrons on the surface of the cup away from the positive kernels that makes it charged, capable of producing its own small electric fields and moving charges produces magnetic fields attracting tap water.<br>4. What happened to the cereal is what I don&#39;t know exactly, but still I can predict that might be charges are induced onto the cereal by the strong magnet by the process of induction that makes behave as a magnetic system of like charges.<br>5. The flying off of the tea bag is a very interesting phenomenon. When it was burning and it reaches the end, due to burning, the air above it got lighter and a low pressure region is created above it. When the fire reached its last phase, the weight of the tea bag that was left was unable to balance the force that was pulling it above due to the low pressure region and thus flew off.<br>HOPE YOU LIKE THE ANSWERS! \ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T15:27:11Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "SqueakSquawk4", "comment_text": "My guess is:<br>1) Something to do with phycology<br>2) The bettery is one one side?

Your fingers should have the same frictional coefficients, otherwise you can&#39;t reach the center of mass.", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T15:12:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ruhaan Arora", "comment_text": "Wow<br>Love your videos \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2020-10-22T13:58:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zzzTIME TRAVEL", "comment_text": "Recent discovery (my YT icon is a mathematical proof; click to view on Instagram):  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CF9RDvhnOl2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CF9RDvhnOl2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</a><br>The guitar may be an instrument created for the dyslexic - the guitar&#39;s &quot;B&quot; string inherently has 5<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23s\">#s</a>/bs, and naturally its relative major is at the &quot;D&quot; string, with 2<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23s\">#s</a>/bs.

Probably messed some up...<br><br>1. The cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form Your finger than the heavier side, so that finger moves faster towards the COM of the cane. This causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass...<br>2. The phone is not evenly weighed, so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize, right...? Well, the same effect is observed when spinning a brick (it fell on my foot... twice... while I tested that) that I played around with. I believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brick/phone is in the middle of the whole object, so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the COM will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum, the spin is easier. On the other hand, spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy, so this state is unstable. The phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate, which is a more stable state (rhyme unintended). The same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending Your hands out, which causes You to decelerate.<br>3. This one is a bit of a troll... I tested deuterium water and distilled water... and the distilled one produced no (less) effect! It\u2019s not the water that is attracted to the cup, it\u2019s the stuff in it (ions)!!!<br>4. The cereal contains some iron, which is magnetic. This makes it attracted to the magnet... Maybe, but what is interesting is that water and glass, fex, are pushed away by magnets... it\u2019s diamagnetic! Anyways... Maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into? I did not observe one, I do not know, but I did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor!<br>5. Hot air rises. As the hot air creates a rising bubble, the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away. When it gets light enough, it slowly flies up...<br><br>Hope I am correct. :)<br><br>HAND!

If a machine were to do that I doubt it\u2019d work. <br>2) The human hand is not perfectly balanced. An uneven force is placed on the phone (torque) causing it to rotate initially. The phone has objects inside it making the mass distribution uneven as well. With this when gravity acts it applies a force proportional to the mass distribution causing more torque and therefore more/faster rotation. <br>3) Water is polarized causing an electric field. The closer to a charged object another charged abject comes the stronger the electric force becomes. So when the molecule rotated it becomes closer to the attractive side causing a net force in the direction of the cup allowing it to move toward it. This can also be explained through magnetism but would be more situational. <br>4) I don\u2019t believe the cereal is attracted to the charge. I would say that is the water molecules rearranging and pushing the cereal toward that side. <br>5) This is a mix of chemistry and physics. When objects burn they lose oxygen molecules, some others and become lighter because of it. Couple this with the fact that heat is caused by the increase in kinetic energy of molecules (increased movement)  it can float. Yes float because it becomes less dense than or equally dense to the air around it. This creates a buoyant force allowing it to lift and the kinetic energy from the heat gives it that rocket appearance.", "comment_date": "2018-07-28T16:50:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uae45\uac15", "comment_text": "Korean Subtitles!!!!!!!!!!!

I feel like I remember hearing that static electricity has a very strong gradient but I don&#39;t know.<br>(4) Most cereal has dietary iron added to it, but it is actually just very small iron filings. If you blend cereal up, put it in water in a clear container, and touch a magnet to the bottom, you&#39;ll see a small pile of iron filings. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s attracted to a magnet.<br>(5) As the tea bag burns it looses mass. Once enough, or all, of it has burned it is light enough to be picked up by the small current of heat created by the flame.<br><br>Just some thoughts.

The gravity pulls the water closer using the positive pull but the negative pull is canceling that out, this happens because the pulls start at the opposite ends in which they are pulling to because of the magnetism, BUT since the gravity is in as well, it tugs at the atom and the negative pull gets PUSHED BACK, allowing the positive charge to continue it&#39;s pull one step ahead of the negative.<br><br>4.

For the first one I think it is our subconscious nature that we end up near center of mass. When we move from the two ends of the rod we basically have a perfectly balanced rod in the first place. As we move the fingers to the center we do not want to make it fall and hence our body puts our fingers at the bottom of center of mass. I believe it has something similar to our neural networks which helps us to stand straight and not fall down when someone gives us a gentle push, even though it is an unconscious effort.<br>2. For second one, I only have one answer in my mind -- chaos.<br>3. For the third one I think it is perhaps the air around the cup which deviates the stream of water because the cup is placed very close to water. The air between the cup and the stream of water is less at the center and it increase outwardly due to circular nature of cup. Hence a type of pressure gradient. Btw i have tried this experiment hundreds of time and never succeeded.<br>4. The cereal is not magnetic. It has something to do with the surrounding air and water which form some kind of pressure gradient for cereal to move around with the magnet.<br>5. The CO2 formed from burning the tea bag fills it completely and creates enough pressure to lift it up.<br><br>That&#39;s all I could think of.

The greater the normal force the greater the maximum static friction that exists between your finger and the cane. So the finger that is further away will have a smaller maximum static friction with the cane because of its smaller normal force. When you move your fingers together while both touching the cane, something must slip. And since the finger further away has a smaller static friction threshold with the cane, it will slip first (assuming your fingers are moving at the same rate relative to the cane). And this finger will continue to slip until it is closer to the center of mass/gravity. Then the other finger will slip and so on.

The cane trick doesn&#39;t work if you just place your fingers under it, because it&#39;s extremely hard to simply guess the exact point of balance. However, if you start from both ends and move in, your body feels the shifts in the balance, and can compensate.<br>2. The phone flip doesn&#39;t work because of the simple matter of human error. With the other two, it&#39;s pretty easy to keep the forces even to keep the phone on one axis; four fingers move as one body and a thumb the other. This is different for the last flip because each one of your fingers is being used simultaneously to generate torque on the phone. In case you didn&#39;t notice, it is virtually impossible to move all your fingers at the same time and with the same force, so when you flip your phone there will always be some variation.\u00a0<br>3. Like you said in another of your videos, water is usually pretty neutral. But, you also said that there will always be some variation in charge of the water molecules. The cup pulls on some of the more positively charged water molecules, and due to water&#39;s cohesive nature, it pulls the rest along with it.<br>4. Several cereal brands boast of their cereal&#39;s high iron content. This is the very same iron we use to build things with, but it just very tiny. There were actually some girls who gathered iron from cheerios for a science fair project. The reason it only works in water is probably because the cheerio is so freaking light on its own, and the iron is even more light and small. The water removes a lot of the friction normally experienced and allows for movement.<br>5. The teabag rocket works because of the nature of its shape and mass. As the teabag burns, it creates a sort of tunnel of hot air above it. As it burns lower, it loses more and more mass in the form of smoke and other debris until the very last remnants of it burn enough mass off to rise with that stream of hot air. If you ever look at a campfire, you will notice the same thing going on with the sparks that float up and occasionally land on you.

You&#39;ll be moving your fingers towards each other only in the measure the cane allows you to...it actually &quot;controls&quot; your movements by the simple act of rebalancing itself.\u00a0 For instance, the finger that&#39;s closer to the center of equilibrium will experience slightly more friction because the cane will be pushing against it the hardest, that will result in your other finger being able to move more easily (thus, faster). When the situation gets reversed, the other finger will then move faster and this process will go on until both fingers are at the point of equilibrium. It&#39;s all about balancing and friction.<br><br>2- This is due to friction too. The phone will try to move in the most efficient way (the one that requires less effort, that is). Since that kind of rotation involves the larger area of the phone, there&#39;s too much air friction for the rotation to be maintained as it is, so the phone eventually &quot;surrenders&quot; to friction and starts tilting so air can pass through more easily.<br>It stabilizes on the other axis because it&#39;s the more efficient one... I guess...<br><br>3- LOL...I&#39;m going to say friction again! Well, air currents, to be more exact.<br>As the water stream moves, it pushes the air around it. When you put the cup close to it, you are creating a &quot;wall&quot; that blocks the air&#39;s path as it gets pushed by the stream of water. Perhaps that creates some sort of air current that circulates, making the air slightly less dense on the cup&#39;s side. That means that the air on the opposite side of the water stream will push harder against the stream than the air on the cup&#39;s side and that will make the stream come closer to the cup....<br>I&#39;m saying this because that&#39;s what happens with shower curtains. They move inside the shower and stick to your body because the air within the shower is less dense (since the water stream of the shower is creating an air current).<br>Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but this explanation is damn good, LOL<br><br>4- The cereal thing...I&#39;ll say that when it contacts water it becomes polarized.<br><br>5- That&#39;s an easy one. The convection currents created by the mix between hot and cold air are lifting what&#39;s left of the bag.<br>It doesn&#39;t start levitating until the end because that&#39;s when it becomes light enough for the convection currents to lift it.<br>Let&#39;s say that the twr (thrust-weight ratio) is too low until the bag turns completely into ashes (which are extremely light), then the twr equals 1 (or more) and so the ashes are lifted....much like a rocket. I guess that, in the end, that can also be considered friction, LOL<br><br><br><br>Ok, now I&#39;m going to watch how wrong I am, LOL<br>\u00a0<br>\u00a0\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-10T06:24:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Gross", "comment_text": "Do stick flips or &quot;phone flips&quot; with a skilled drummer.

We then assume that this means that everything is moving away from us. Since things that are far away appear to be moving faster, we assume that space everywhere is expanding in all directions. Extrapolating back grime the current rate of expansion we then come to the conclusion that there was a beginning point, where the universe was infinitely dense, thus, the Big Bang. At this point, the laws of Physics fall apart and science cannot fully explain the beginning. The half-answer is that nothing was before the Big Bang because time did not exist. However, all of these conclusions hinge of the assumption that red shift is exclusive to expansion. However, this is not necessarily true. Suppose light degrades over long distances - not through absorption (which would cause a light amplitude decrease as a percentage of photons are wholly absorbed in the particle sense and we account for this by identifying reference markers that produce a theoretically known output), but through a form of photonic evaporation. A photon traveling through space may interact with neutrinos or other subatomic particles that do not absorb or deflect the photon entirely or even defract the wave, but may interact with the energy of the photon causing it to red shift. This effect would be very small and only detectable over incredibly long distances (such as the observation of light from distant galaxies). It would also compound and become more apparent in further galaxies. With this hypothesis, the need for an expanding universe theory becomes obsolete, as does the need for a Big Bang or any beginning of time. While it is true that objects moving towards or away from us exhibit blue or red shift, the fact that things far away are red shifted does not necessarily mean that they are moving away and a universal red shift observation is not sufficient grounds to establish an origin of the universe hypothesis.

Reposting\u00a0Marcin Szczurowski&#39;s answers:<br><br>1) When center of gravity is closer to one finger, the force related to gravitational pull is greater on that finger. Therefore friction is greater and when it&#39;s great enough, it becomes static friction. Finger which is further away from the center of gravity now moves closer to it until it will cross the balance and stop and so on.<br>2) If phone is rotated along axis perpendicular to the screen, momentum is greatest. Greatest force is needed to actually change rotation direction. Aerodynamic forces are the weakest in that configuration. Second most extreme case is rotating it as you show it. Momentum isn&#39;t that big and aerodynamic forces push it out of balance easily. Then you have precession and nutation...<br>3) Polar nature of water molecules actually contributes here. Keesom force is ~1/r^6 so it wouldn&#39;t work in that distance. It looks like plain electrostatic force caused by electrostatic induction.<br>4) Cereal contain magnetic particles. I guess no special tricks here ;)<br>5) Tea bag is very light. When it burns it gets even lighter. Also, flame causes hot air to go up, which is direct cause to convection. The rest of teabag lifts on convection current. It should be even easier to show when you burn it on some kind of wire net or strainer.

Your phone isn&#39;t balanced for it and will tend to spin around its center of mass.

In order to counter that, your finger moves toward the center of mass. The phone explanation is fairly simple. This works much like the spinning disk trick Derek showed on his channel. The phone, when flipped on its screen, has largest air resistance, which works no different than friction. This slows the torque in one direction and caused torque in a second direction, causing the unbalanced center of mass, which is at the top for most phones, to be off center to the contact, which causes more turning, in which gyroscopic momentum takes over causing the phone to spin in multiple directions.

The closer one of one&#39;s fingers is getting to the center of mass, the stronger is the exerted force on the particular finger thus more weight being on it and hence is it easier to move the other finger near the center of mass until it is closer as the other. This goes on until both fingers are under the center of mass.<br><br>To #2: Either the mass is not balanced thus forcing the spin along another axis, or more energy is required to spin along the intended axis (perhaps due to traction between object and air), so the object is reorienting\u00a0 itself along an axis wich requires less energy to spin around.<br><br><br>To #3: Despite you saying that water it is not attracted due to it being a polar molecule, the polarity of the water, and partly, too, due to the dissolved ions in it, is responsible for the deflection/attraction. I conclude this because Petroleum, a non polar/not as strong polar molecule as water, is not affected. However, substances and solvents which are, such as water, highly polar or have a lot of freely moving charges are affected. Water is a special case because it forms Hydrogen bonds due to the high difference in electronegativity of &#39;H&#39; &amp; &#39;O&#39;.

The others might be right about friction, but that seems like it&#39;s not enough to cause this. I say it&#39;s all in our heads. When somebody else is holding the cane, you can&#39;t feel it falling one way or another and you can&#39;t compensate.<br>2) Let&#39;s call X, Y and Z the length, width and height of a phone. It seems the longer the axis you&#39;re trying to rotate it, the harder it is to get a good flip. I think it might be because the center of gravity is closer to the margin along the Y axis than around the X. I observed that when flipping along the Z axis, the center of gravity stays almost in the same place, so it&#39;s very stable. When flipping along the Y axis, it moves more. But flipping along the X axis, the center of gravity moves the most, therefore you create the most instability in the system. And it wants to quickly stabilize itself and it&#39;s easier to do this by flipping the phone on the Y axis just as it&#39;s about to reach the tipping point along the X axis. If you don&#39;t put enough force to tip it over the X axis, it&#39;ll just flip along the Y. If you do put enough force, it&#39;ll flip along both, but in a way that stabilizes it faster (rotating along the diagonal is faster at spending that extra energy you put into the system than rotating end over end).<br>3) Actually, I think you might be wrong. It must be the polar side of the water. I&#39;m thinking when I pull a magnet with another magnet (let&#39;s say I&#39;m holding on to the negative side and I&#39;m using the plus to get close to the other magnet). Unless I push perfectly against the other magnet&#39;s positive, it&#39;ll flip and the negative will stick to my positive. Even though the positive side of the magnet is still being repelled by my positive, the magnets will still pull each other until they connect. That&#39;s because the magnetic lines are only ever straight going perpendicular to the poles. Get in from any other angle and I hit a magnetic line coming from the other pole (negative) which will pull on the negative side along that line, rotating it (especially as I&#39;m pushing the positive side at the same time in the other way). Water is basically the same, just weaker. But as soon as you rotate one molecule, it is now facing with the negative away from the cup, thus attracting with its negative side another molecule&#39;s positive side (in addition to the cup&#39;s negative). This results in a chain reaction that bends the water towards the cup.<br>4) Iron and various other ferous minerals in the cereal in an environment with little friction?<br>5) Miniature hot air balloon.

Furthermore, they have more structural stability due to its shorter lever-arm radius, the pivot axis is located in the center of the phone. But the harder spin is less stable because the pivot axis is at the edge of the phone rather than the center.<br>3) This is a tough one. I still think the explanation provided in the video is enough.

This weight, along with the moving finger, move toward the static finger until the force (f=ma) of the moving side overpowers the force of friction on the static side allowing the two fingers to begin moving toward each again until one finger stops again, repeating the process until there are equal amounts of (cane) weight over the two fingers, which have now become one fulcrum. <br>#2: the flat side of the phone presents more surface area and is pushed off its axis due to surface tension between the surface area of the phone and the oxygen and the molecules in the air. <br>#3: (I&#39;m really guessing on these \ud83d\ude1c) the oxygen molecules in the air surrounding the charged cup become negatively charged and are pushed away from the cup creating an atmosphere that is less dense allowing the water to be drawn to the outer &quot;shell&quot; of the charged air due to the polarity of the oxygen molecules in the water and air.

No matter where you start, how fast you move your finger, the brain actually determines the rough COM (centre of mass)and stops your fingers from moving once you are close to it. Guessing is difficult because our eyes cannot determine the mass distribution of the stick. But due to continuous feedback from our finger about the mass distribution of the stick, the brain adjusts the position of our fingers. if you notice clearly, the finger while trying to balance, also moves slightly up and down to balance the extra torque. The final answer is that the fingers move to balance the torque on each finger. (even up and down till the two fingers meet at the COM)<br>2) Whenever a &#39;free&#39; body is given a torque, it always rotates about its center of gravity (since the earth&#39;s gravitational field is almost uniform at this scale, COM and COG coincides). so we can also say that it rotates about its COM.Due to the asymetric distribution of mass, it tries to re-orient itself to the axis which has a symmetric distribution. Thus explaining the seemingly irregular rotation of your iphone. (and hope you didnt break it in the fall :P) If you want a further technical explanation, the extra mass due to a component of its weight, causes a torque and since the phone is rotating already, this causes a tilt, (conserving angular momentum) similar to the explanation of conservation of angular momentum of a gyro. and this tilt is oscillating because in every tilt, the weight component of the heavier part increases and decreases causing the peculiar rotation.<br>3) The deflection of the water stream is due to the turbulence of air created by the magnet. There are tiny dust particles which are magnetic (may be due to intrinsic or induced magnetism) which are attracted towards the cup. this movement or technically - Entrainment of air between the cup and water stream cases the water jet to deflect. The curvature of the cup also plays an important role. \u00a0And try to do the same with a flat surface - say a plastic square dice or plate . Ths effect is extremely neglible or doesnt happen. This deflection due to the cup happens even when the cup is not charged. This effect is called coanda effect and is practically used in fluid logic gates and STOL aircrifts.( this effect is more rpofound in streamlined flow) The main physics behind the coanda effect is still under research.<br>4) No idea. More info needed.<br>5) I think the tea paper is made of a blend of plastic and paper.here, i say plastic for any extremely long polymer.

In the first scenario, you are flipping it in a fashion such that the phone has very little surface area for air resistance as relative to the force vector that is causing it to spin. In the second, you are flipping it very close to its center of mass. However, in the third, you are flipping it with a wide surface area for air resistance, and from a point that is as far from the center of mass as possible. This gives you a very wide margin for human error, which in the end I believe this comes down to. Even an &quot;almost perfect&quot; flip isn&#39;t actually perfect.

Not sure on this one, but I am pretty sure that the answer lies within insulation/conduction, rather than polarity. We know that water is more conductive than air. This is why electricity runs through it easily, and why humidity has such a large effect on temperature. We also know that plastic is a great insulator. I can only speculate that insulation of the plastic cup and the conductivity of the water would cause the electricity to be more attracted to the water, thus causing the deflection.<br><br>4.

Your arms and hands are then &quot;locked&quot; in that equilibrium state, and every time you move your fingers along the cane you unconsciously adjust the position of your fingers so that the amount of weight they&#39;re feeling is always the same, thus counterbalancing the torque put on the cane because of the distance between the equivalent push point and the center of mass of the cane.<br>When you put you fingers right from the beginning at the center of mass, your arms and hands do not put the same amount of force to counter the weight, thus producing torque which causes the cane to fall.<br>2. The phones have their weight adjusted along the long axis and normal-to-screen axis because they are important to the feeling of adjusted mass when in our hands. The short axis however is not important because we have our fingers all around the most important direction of weight distribution (the long axis of the phone) thus counterbalancing the torque that&#39;ll make it turn along the short axis. It&#39;s linked to the shape of the weight distribution matrix with the intertial products being equal to zero for the well-balanced axis thus not producing a torque when spinned along that axis, and not equal to zero for the short axis, producing a torque in other axis. That&#39;s why the rotation isn&#39;t &quot;clean&quot; when the phone is spinned along the short axis.<br>3. It&#39;s not because water is polar, this trick works with every material if it can moves along two axis of gap-closing between the material and the electrically charged object. For conducting materials, &quot;free&quot; electrons are pushed to the farest place from the charged object in the conducting material, thus attracting the closest part of the material from the charged object, towards the charged object.<br>For non-conducting materials, i have two theories. The first being that water has a pH of 7, which means that hydroxide ions and their ionics water-type ions are present in water. With the electrical field, tha negatively charged ions are pushed away from the charged object, and the positively charged object are attracted toward the charged object, thus attracting the water toward the charged object.<br>My second theory is that the shape of the atoms, desinged by the electron&#39;s orbits of every atoms are distorded because of the electric fiels, and makes it possible to the now atoms <b>with a nucleus close to the charged object and the electrons away from it</b> attracted toward the charged object.<br>4. For the cheerio, the argumentation is the same, but there&#39;s a subtle difference. The cheerio is full of water, and the ater inside of it is attracted toward the magnet. The waterless part of the cheerio floating above the surface, and being relatively light in comparison to the water it&#39;s full of, is being moved around by the attraction of the water inside of it toard the magnet. You could possibly do the same thing with an electrically charged object.<br>5.When you burn the teabag in that shape, you produce hot and light air which wants to go up (giving the flame it&#39;s shape). The thing is, when the fire comes to the bottom of the teabag, the teabag is light enough for the flame to pull the teabag upward with it, and this movement accelerate because of the constantly reducing mass of the teabag and the constant pull of the flame. It only works in this configuration because there&#39;s a higher surface of chemical reaction (more flame) for every unit of mass of the teabag (the &quot;chainmill&quot; of fabric is spread wide enough for the final flame fueld pulling point to happen before the teabag is entirely consumed), and because there&#39;s an air column hotter then room temperature accumulated inside the teabag tube, thus giving pressure (hot air column) under the teabag, and depression over the teaba (the flame).<br>Hope you read my answer, even if it&#39;s late.", "comment_date": "2014-08-09T10:30:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pds314159", "comment_text": "1.

That&#39;s a beautiful self-calibrating system (other stuff going on, but same result as with railway wheels - you could cover that topic once, it is really fascinating!). The moment one finger gets nearer to the centre of mass than the other, there is more gravitational force onto that finger than on the other, increasing friction, which means the other one moves faster. It &quot;overtakes&quot; the first one, thus becoming the closer one, thus becoming the more loaded one, thus becoming the more braked one, so the first one slips faster... etc. Thus a limitation of the demonstration: It only works with roughly constant coefficient of friction. Would it be rubber on one and steel on the other side of the centre of mass, the self-calibration would not work any more.<br>2. I would guess that&#39;s an aerodynamic issue. The slightest instability (and since the object&#39;s movement through air is creating turbulence, there always is instability no matter how exact you may start off) makes the object turn slightly around the long axis - and once this has happened, the surface isn&#39;t perpendicular to the vector of movement, resulting in a sidewards force by the air which leads to further tilt, throwing the whole thing off course. If you flip it around the long axis, you also have the same effect; but in this case the object turns much faster (since the mass is nearer to the axis) resulting in much higher resistance towards changes to the movement (same effect which keeps bicycles stable), so the rotation is subdued to slight slingering only instead of being completely destabilised.<br><br>5. The flame creates hot air, which is going up, thus creating a pressure drop which sucks (cold) air from the sides towards the flame resulting in an eddy (that suck of air towards the fire is the very same effect on which the principle of fighting fire with fire is based).

When your friend is holding the cane, you&#39;d have to know exactly where the center of mass is to correctly place your fingers. When you&#39;re doing it yourself, the finger on the lighter side (outside of both fingers) of the cane will move more easily toward the center of mass than the finger on the heavier side, due to less friction. Once both fingers are an equal distance from the center of mass, they will both slide together with equal friction toward the center of mass.<br>2. I really don&#39;t know, but I would guess the Earth&#39;s rotation might have a slight effect. Once the length (forward and back relative to the phone-flipper) of the object exceeds the width (left to right relative to the phone-flipper,) the rotation of front end over back end becomes subject to the Earth&#39;s rotation because of the object&#39;s shorter axis of rotation.<br>OR (after writing the whole comment this occurred to me. lol)<br>When the length of the phone (forward to back) is shorter than the width of the phone, the effects of gravity on each end of the width (longer side) are sufficient enough to straighten or correct any uneven force you may have given to each side of the width of the phone when flipping it, or the inertia in the flipping direction would be greater than the inertia over the different axis of rotation that is caused by our human error to apply the force evenly on both ends of the phone while flipping it. This would straighten the phone to flip end over end. But when the length of the phone is greater than the width, the uneven force given to each end of the width of the phone (on the left and right relative to the phone-flipper) while flipping causes the rotational inertia over the axis caused by your uneven flipping to be greater than the rotational inertia around the shorter axis of the intended flip. I think this would be because when you have the longer side flipping end to end (front and back to the flipper,) there is more mass moving in the direction of the flip than the direction of the uneven applied force, whereas when the shorter side is flipping front to back, there is less mass moving in the direction of the flip than in the direction of the uneven applied force. Causing the longer axis to win out over time.\u00a0<br>*If the Earth&#39;s rotation doesn&#39;t come into play, I think the phone could theoretically be flipped perfectly if the force applied to each end while flipping is exactly equivalent.<br>3. I&#39;m not really clear on why the taught reason is incorrect, but I would think that this phenomenon would happen with any liquid with varying degrees based on mass and viscosity. When you rub the cup on your hair you remove electrons from the outer surface of the cup, causing the surface&#39;s charge to be more positive than it was before. The water molecules whose negative sides are pointing toward the surface of the cup would be attracted to the now more positively charged surface of the cup.\u00a0<br>4. Since a water molecule has a positively charged side, and a negatively charged side, I would think that water molecules may be slightly magnetic, where the positively charged side would be attracted to the negatively charged side of the magnet, and vise versa. I don&#39;t think the cereal itself becomes magnetic once in the water, but the water absorbed inside the cereal is reacting to the magnet, causing the piece of cereal to move. I think this would happen whether the cereal is present or not, we just can&#39;t see it happening when there&#39;s only water.<br>5. I think that the whole time the teabag is burning, the burning matter is &quot;pulled&quot; upward because it is hotter and would want to rise, but there is still solid matter connected to it, whose downward force of gravity is greater than the upward force of (buoyancy?) Once the flame reaches the last bit of paper, there is no longer any unburnt matter, so the hot matter is now free of any cooler matter tethering it down, so it rises, like heat likes to.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-08-09T01:59:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "superdudex6", "comment_text": "404&#39;d... darn futuristic books.", "comment_date": "2014-08-09T01:29:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "funstuffq", "comment_text": "There&#39;s iron in cereal, for another fun experiment, pour a bunch of cereal in to a blender and then blend it with the rest filled with water.

So the finger with less force acting on it will move at a greater speed toward the center of mass when you move both fingers towards each other because it experiences less friction when its moving. You will end up with both fingers under the center of mass, because the finger closer to the center of mass gets \u201cdelayed\u201d because of more friction when moving, because it experiences a higher load on top of it.<br><br>Phone \u201cTrick\u201d: You are not introducing the force to start the spinning movement in the exact middle of the short side of the phone and also your fingers supporting the underside of the phone are not completely identically placed on each left and right sides of the phone. So this imbalance causes it to spin around 2 sides because you give it the momentum to do so and the spin around the short side doesn\u2019t need much force, because all mass is located relatively close to the center of the axis.<br>If you try to flip it over the long side (like holding it in landscape mode), then you can more accurately place your finger in the middle of the long side, so the momentum to start spinning around the second axis is much smaller, and because it is the long side of the phone, it has mass located further away from the center, so it would actually need even more force to start spinning around long side.\u00a0<br><br>Short answer for the cereal magnetism: Cereal contains small amounts of iron and a strong (neodymium) magnet can create a visible effect on it like you\u2019ve demonstrated in the video.<br><br>Moving the water stream: The electric field of the cup creates an effect on the movable electric charges inside the water (i don\u2019t mean the rotation of the molecules or the molecules themselves).<br>These charges opposite to the charge of the cup accumulate on the closer side the stream, whereas the equally charged particles get pushed away.

Main difference between the two cases lies in the senses used to judge the position of the centre of mass of cane. First case (receiving cane from friend) involves the brain making an intuitive judgment simply out of sight, rather than touch, so the centre of mass is determined simply by a very rough estimate of how heavy each end of the cane is, perhaps by their relative sizes. Second case (feeling cane by oneself) involves the brain receiving numerous signals channeled through the central nervous system. Notice that each finger inches towards the centre of mass in an alternate fashion, in quick succession regardless of the absolute speed of each finger. One finger sends signals to the brain that its end is heavier, causing the other to move further inward, before the roles are interchanged. Process repeats until centre of mass is found. Of course, accuracy of this method decreases proportionately to how fast the fingers move towards the center, as shown in the video whereby the cane &#39;wobbles&#39; around until it comes to a stop.<br><br>2. This is possibly due to the fact that the weight distribution within the phone is uneven, especially so when considering the plane whose axis of rotation lies in a direction such that the phone flips from end to end. In mid-air, weight imbalances within the phone itself result in non-equal magnitudes of torque acting on each end of the phone, thus causing its direction of rotation to alter repeatedly, such that the flipping motion seems to be &#39;unclean&#39;. While weight imbalances would probably exist when considering other axes of rotations as well, the difference in torque established by these imbalances would not be as significant (imagine flipping phone along its long end. While phone spins in mid-air, the left end and right end of phone have almost identical weight acting on them, so the direction of rotation hardly changes)<br><br>3. Not too sure about this one but here goes. Rubbing the cup on a rough surface releases negative charges, ie. Electrons, which accumulate on the surface of the cup. Now, consider an extremely small area along the surface of the stream at the molecular level and let time come to a pause. Placing the temporarily electron-rich surface of the cup sufficiently near to the stream instantaneously attracts the water molecules which, at that instant, have their oxygen ends facing away from this surface. At this same instant, molecules which have their oxygen ends facing towards this surface are repelled away by a small extent and move away from the layer of &#39;positive charges&#39;. Molecules which have their oxygen ends facing in a direction parallel to this surface remain unaffected and continue moving downwards under action of gravity. This differs from the misconception that all the water molecules simply &#39;flip&#39; around instantaneously. Now, as we move on to subsequent time frames, given the fact that the molecules are after all moving in a stream with a steady input of water molecules, more and more molecules whose oxygen ends face away from the cup surface are generated from the tap, as the stream continues flowing down. Eventually, more and more molecules then find themselves attracted to the cup surface (ie. &#39;Positive charges&#39; accumulatr) such that the bending of the water stream becomes significantly visible. The same phenomenon produces diminished effects as the flow velocity increases, since the net downward force acting on each water molecule significantly outweighs the electrostatic forces of attraction between stream and cup.<br><br>4. The magnet-induced motion is due to existence of ferromagnetic substances in cereal. One might argue that if this is indeed true, then an entire box of cereal would &#39;fly&#39; towards any magnet that comes near it. The key to what is shown in the video is that there was only a single piece of cereal floating on the water. This differs from an entire box of cereal in terms of weight (duh), ie. If the same magnet was used against a box of cereal, the magnetic force would essentially be too weak to overcome the weight acting on the cereal box. Besides, the same phenomenon would not be observed if the cereal was placed on a solid surface, say a table, because the magnetic force would be too weak to work against friction. Friction between cereal and water surface is significantly lower, and thus can be overcome by the magnetic force despite its weak nature, thus the floating piece of cereal freely moves around under the control of the magnet.<br><br>5. Lift is generated due to the temperature gradient between the flame and the ambient surroundings (ie. Hot air rises). Teabags are made of highly porous material so that its contents can diffuse easily in aqueous medium, and therefore its density is relatively low. So much so that once a small percentage of the original teabag is left, the small amount of lift generated is nevertheless sufficient to propel the teabag upwards.

When you flip your phone in the first two ways described in the video, the force that is needed to change the phone path is much more than the torque it has for spinning. It does wiggle a bit, but not enough to \u00a0But when you flip it end to end, the force needed to rotate the phone in other axis is much lower, and your way of flipping is not even precise to begin with. The initial force it self is causing the phone to rotate in other directions too. And if your initial force was precisely to the center of the mass and in one axis, I thing the air friction would add some force and it would rotate at last. ( because I doubt that the phone is symmetrical relative to the center of the mass.)\u00a0<br>I mean, I think it is possible to make a perfect flip end to end, I don&#39;t think it would be easy for humans to do without a machine to force it precisely in that direction exactly on the center of the mass and in a vacuum.<br>3:The water you used in this video is not pure. It is full of little particles and that is what make water an electrical conductor. This is due to the fact that positively charged particles and negatively charged particles can move freely inside water. I think that is the reason. The electrical field of the cup is strong enough to move these particles inside the water, depending on the charge of the field, some of particles would move toward the cup and some of them would move away. The distance between these particles, would cause the electrical force to be greater on the ones closer to the cup, and that is the reason the stream of water attracted to the cup. At least that is what I think is happening.<br>4: I have no Idea what is in the cereal! It is not very common here in Iran.\u00a0<br>But I&#39;m guessing that It is like the previous phenomena, some of the ingredients of the cereal is dissolved in the water around it. Aside from this, I have no clue. Because they are not moving so a magnetic field shouldn&#39;t have any effect on it.\u00a0<br>5: Another one that I don&#39;t have much clue. But I&#39;m gonna guess anyway.<br>The fire makes the air around it hot. Which makes it lighter. As for the air outside of the teabag, this doesn&#39;t make much of a difference. But the air inside of the bag is isolated ( very poorly of course, but enough to make a slight change in pressure) The air inside gets hot and expand and escape from the open top of the teabag. When the fire gets to the end, the rush of air from the bottom and the light weight of the bag on fire makes it fly.<br>.<br>looking forward to see what are the real answers! thank you for you great work.", "comment_date": "2014-08-08T08:45:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sonny Haffenden", "comment_text": "Cane: more mass = more friction, friction balances out resistive force so centre of mass is found.<br>Phone: a combination of air resistance and off centre mass.<br>Water stream and cup: no idea :P<br>Cereal: literally has little bits of iron in it<br>Teabag: heat causes tiny mass left to rise?", "comment_date": "2014-08-08T08:35:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dorian Golej", "comment_text": "The balancing cane... well you could balance it if its passed off to you and you get the right spot... but the later, is from gravity and which finger the center of mass is on from the Cane, you can feel it, more mass on this finger... the other can move more towards the center, vice versa", "comment_date": "2014-08-08T08:35:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Sommerville", "comment_text": "Was I the only one to make like 5 tea bag rockets?", "comment_date": "2014-08-08T08:20:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TechXSoftware", "comment_text": "Blurring that apple logo is pointless, I think people might know what company made it.", "comment_date": "2014-08-08T08:16:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muchacho8", "comment_text": "Ok, my attempt<br>1) This actually looks more to do with our perception than physics.

Since you are pushing together your fingers, and the bar stays (approximately) still, you are applying two equal and opposite forces on the bar in the horizontal direction. In the vertical direction the closer you are to the center of mass, the higher is the force you need, thus the higher friction will be present. Then two situation can happen: the first is that you overcome the static friction, and that will be on the farther finger from the center of mass, so that finger will move. The second situation will happen when you push so hard that both fingers lose contact. In that case the forces will distribute in such a way that you will reach the center of mass. If not so, in the case you go over the center of mass with one finger, that finger would stop and the bar would fall down. Anyway it might not work if the two materials have very different friction coefficients.<br>2) I think the main reason is conservation of angular momentum. Friction of the air might contribute but it should not be that effective with such a heavy object. Due to the initial unbalancement of your fingers you give also a little spin on the direction of the lowest rotational inertia (the long semiaxis of the phone). Any initial unbalancement will anyway try to bring the object to spin along its axis of maximum inertia (the axis perpendicular to the screen). Since the friction of the air is low, it will keep this periodic precession oscillation. The air friction could play a role in a very long drop. I suppose that the object would align laterally, sliding through air.<br>3) It is not due to some air pressure effect. I think the main reason could be the presence of some ions in the water (minerals, salt, hydroxyl) thus allowing the water to conduct. If water conducts, then the distribution of the ions (positive near the cup, negative far away) is enough to create a pull force also with such a low gradient due to the elctrostatic field of the cup.<br>4) It should be due to the pure iron into the cereals or due to the paramagnetism of the components of the cereals. Anyway it is a really small force, and the water allows to see better the effect of this tiny magnetic force. Since paramagnetism is really extremely weak, I guess it&#39;s for the iron.<br>5) It is heating the air around and within the paper pipe creating convection of heat and therefore a flux of air.

Basically bobs up and down the floor between your fingers alternating with its ends while to move the fingers together.

The reason you always end up with your fingers on the center of gravity is because of friction. As experimenter moves the fingers together one of the fingers is bound to be closer to the center of gravity and hence will have more normal force acting upon it increasing the force of friction. This in turn causes the other side to slide easier, making sure the center of gravity stays in the center. This can be proven by using a stick with half of it lubed up.<br><br>2.

I currently don&#39;t own an old phone without a gyroscope so I cannot test this theory :/<br><br>3. Even though the dipole is too small for the effect to be visible, the water molecules self-dissociate when introduced to electric field fluctuations caused by the realignment of of the dipoles. This creates hydrogen ions (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions which are collected on the opposite sides due to the electric field creating a much bigger dipole which is easily attracted by the already present electric field.<br><br>4. It is not the cereal that is magnetic but the water. Water is diamagnetic which means that when it is introduced to magnetic field it creates a magnetic field opposite to it, simply put water is repulsed by magnets. This effect is not very strong but strong enough to to slightly decrease the water level close to the magnet casing the cereal to fill that void.<br><br>5. I think the reason behind the lifting of the last bit of paper is its cylindrical shape. When paper burns, it expels hot &quot;gas&quot; which is lighter than room temperature air, but inside the cylinder the fumes are trapped since the flame is constantly expelling this &quot;gas&quot; leaving only the bottom of the cylinder for it to escape.

If the phone had a mass in the range of 10^10 Newtons, we could blame the coriolis effect, but since the phone is relativly low in mass, it is all down to the partial and uneven vacuum produced at the trailing portions of the face and back of the phone.

In the first case, you have a great radian, in the second one you have a great cross sectional area, but in the third case you have them both, so they probably even multiply.<br>3) This is about electrostatic induction. By rubbing the plastic cup on your hair, you&#39;re removing some of the cup&#39;s atom&#39;s electrons. This generates a positive electric field around the cup, which is trying to pull (negative) electrons towards it. This causes the former neutral water to become a dipole, which means, that the electrons within the water get pulled towards the cup&#39;s side. So there is one half of the water stream, that has more electrons than normal (negative pole) and another half is missing them (positive pole).

The flip alone can determine its path, so if you are good at it, you can control it to the slightest, but the soft skin of the fingers will make this a little more tricky tho the weight of the object will sink into the skin making a variable of pressure applied less or even &quot;sling&quot; effect can occour. So when the phone is at it&#39;s thinnest physical mass rotation point this will make it spin with control. The &quot;tourqe&quot; and weight together makes it go straight in line with the center of mass and rotation. When the phone is on it&#39;s flatter side, the phone has a bigger line to follow, on the center of mass, its so wide the rotation becomes &quot;fluxuating&quot; on how it will rotate. The center of mass is now distributed on each side of the mass (phone) that the out come is random. Each side becomes a &quot;forward&quot; front and then goes in that circle rotation (forward or backwords if you look at it wich way it goes, the torque of the throw will determine the speed it will rotate and that will determine the force of the spin) Which then explains the outcome of where the &quot;push&quot; has the most force from the back of the mass. In that circle of spin, from one side to the othe of sphere the push is near perfect of a mathematical line (straight)\u00a0<br><br>3rd one:<br><br>What you are saying here is a explained theory of something that to me sounds wery likely. Energy in water reacts to electric field and the force (- or +) is the strongest pulls the electrons or atoms to that field, that the rubbing created. Charing up the atoms and stuff. But the thing is, water is a &quot;solid&quot; when it is moved in it&#39;s own &quot;force&quot; where it becomes solid in a matter of the other &quot;energy&quot; force then plays it&#39;s role of &quot;magic&quot; (physical law of our &quot;dark matter&quot; &quot;invisible force&quot;) So the little energy created from that cup (cup is like a little amp) and the hair friction will then get help from the &quot;weight&quot; and push of the water when it comes out the sink. That gravity froce can be changed in direction by the smallest of distortion energy. Its like a invisible push. Its like when you blow on water the same thing happens, the air (o8) atoms are acting towards this &quot;law&quot; can be seen as small spheres (bubbles) that is moved in the air but still is a solid, kinda like the water itself. So by this&#39; I&#39;d imagine that &quot;force&quot; field or &quot;distortion&quot; energy field then acts like this blow and then randomizes the air (o8) around in that field and moves the water towards it. The view of this &quot;pull&quot; field created by the energy of the cup, is like the gravity center of the stick, the center of energy (in spheres and atoms energy is centered and expands or attracts) It is like a time glass, the center of the &quot;flow&quot; has its escape pint or gravity pull. Or like water fall, when it pours down a line, the randomization of the &quot;atoms&quot; (spheres) acts random, but yet the gravity of this mass is pulled towards the most energetic field. Where the most energy is created. (just like when you rub the cup, the energy is created, the water line will have most energy in the gravity pull of center where the water meets the opposite direction water goes straight towards gravity center, passes center and goes other direction but depending on the &quot;fall&quot; this can also determine a lot of things. The laws of gravity has some great questions behind it. So by that the water is then &quot;solid&quot; with the gravity mass force, and the energy created by the cup and hair pulls the water and water pushes the air making less friction and let the energy do the magic of randomizing the out come of the stream. (or maybe the push of the water determines this just like the determination of the push of the phone? The Water acts like the &quot;finger&quot; and is moved by the force of mass and electric field. This was a little tough one, it&#39;s easy to see and understand the concept of the law of physics and field of energy here. But explaining goes from one thing to another explenation on another reason to why. This was one of the tougher to explain. But yet, the reason said in the video, is quite correct, but yet another reason and law behind really why.<br><br>4th one: Simple, little like the 3rd one, water is key here, aswell as energy from the magnet. Water conducts or leads magnetic and electric field. The water is the mass being distorted here, making vibrations around the &quot;mass&quot; wich is in the force field of the water and air. The field of vibration is going to be on this mass and not for example on open water. Then there is no mass to create friction that leads to a energetic field that leads to a pull. But the little cereal might have a few more thigs to say then just being a mass of nothing, it may also act as a energy bomb by itself. This one was also a little more hard to go through. But yet the concious understanding is still there, the possibilities are so endless that the real answer is seen, but not confirmed. (energy from you, cereal stores energy? acts with that law)<br><br>And number 5:<br><br>Gonna be short on this one, we all know that heat rises with laws of gravity, so when the particle and atoms of the fibre in the tea bag is near no mass, the energy pull of the rising heat is strong enough to carry the fibers with it. It is like that energy created on the cup. That center of pull, just like the water ans sand time glass. That pull works then with the energy of the heat that rises and is then pulled upwards from center gravity. The heat I would imagine being like the expantion of the atoms, the &quot;spheres&quot; that explands with energy and inflates with &quot;cold&quot; energy. Like plus and minus energy. Heat rises, and expands the spheres making them levitate upwards from the mass gravity. This one is easy to see aswell, but more I say the more I feel like I have to explain. The explenation is short and simple haha.\u00a0<br><br>Tasks understood, and I must say this is one of the ideas that I&#39;ve loved to see. To get a task to explain the concept here. Finally I have gotten a chance to speak and share thoughts. Great video, have not seen video nr 2 yet, maybe it is not out I dont know.

If one of the fingers moves towards the center of mass of the stick, it gains a larger force from the stick thus increasing the friction. The other finger will now be able to move, because most of the force is one the other finger. This happens until the stick moves its force from the one finger to the other, which is the case if it gets closer to the center of mass than the other. The other finger will now again move towards the center. This whole process repeats until both fingers are at the center of mass.<br><br>2.The large area of the phone&#39;s front creates more air friction. As air is circulating and not consistent, the chance of entropy of the front flip is higher than when flipped on the side. Also the smaller area of side makes it easier to &quot;concentrate&quot; the force. A larger area wouldn&#39;t have equal force applied to everywhere.<br><br>3. Polarisation: By rubbing the cup, it gains extra electrons, which can&#39;t disperse through the cup, as the plastic it&#39;s made from isolates. Holding the cup against the water stream forces the electrons in the water to move away from the cup thus creating a positve side and a negative side of the water stream. As the positve side is closer, the electrons in the cup attract it stronger than they repel the negative side meaning the water stream moves towards the cup.<br><br>4.

The less dense the pubic hair (well, specifically hair follicles), the better the initial balance. This explains elderly canes often being vertical or horizontal- i.e. less pubic hair follicle density for near-levitation levels of 90 degree perfection. The further hands are apart as demonstrated, the more the sternum is able to expand, promoting exaggerated chest breathing and outright stopping stomach extension technique. Even widening arms for a short period can cutoff circulation in the ilium, and through the spinal/hip tilt compensation, this can promote pubic hair follicle death impulses; thus interacting with the cane to cause a more balanced state. --- #2 The bilaterally symmetrical phone flip can easily be done by practicing it with pinky and index finger on either side, but specific explanation of corkscrew flip has to do with USSR dominance in gymnastics by means of extensive microwave research. Further, all modern flat smartphones use ICs that were the result of combined vacuum tube and hash table innovations (that were directly responsible for great chess cheats of the 1960&#39;s), so even with a perfectly mechanically balanced flip and in hypothetical chaos-free zone, movement of such devices will still be influenced by several precursors to Sputnik 1 that are still in orbit. --- #3 The plastic cup gets emotionally unstable due to various dinosaur consciousness emanating directly from the material. Due to age of direct consciousness, intention to physical manifestation takes quite some time to manifest-- when it does, there is a feeling of unease and wanting to attack the water (or anything near). By befriending a plastic cup and treating it kindly, one will find that the consciousness transmutes to affect nearby materials in interesting ways. With regards to running water, the effect is akin to viewing gold flakes in the sunshine (though this does result in a slow, seeming-vaporization of the plastic cup). --- #4 Magnets speak of the blind nature of Love and attraction, with regards to unconditional contexts actually being conditional. With enough magnetic force, one can stop all functions of the human brain to align all consciousness with harmonious Oneness, thus resulting in perceived death. As such, putting enough cereal by one&#39;s head can result in the brain becoming a strong magnet (for cereal, specifically). In summation, the cereal moves because context was perceived as such (through faster than light 12th dimensional infinite now illusory projection). --- #5 Although most teabags are generally filled with stale, sub-par tea materials that are further treated in horrible ways to control brewed-tea color as well as caffeine strength, drinking a tea brewed from such can still be wonderful.

Because our hands/arms like to make the same motion, at the same time, at the same rate, the psychological response with the force of gravity and friction makes you generally move straight into the equilibrium point of the object. Though, this is a bit more difficult the more lopsided the object is(Try a wooden baseball bat, it works far less often - metal bats have more counterweight at the handle).\u00a0<br>#2) This goes back to a video you sort of recently made about randomness. It pertains to Chaos Theory, where minor differences in a system cause the outcome to snowball - especially when the axis of the object is longer. One slight force on either side of the phone means it will flip in the direction with less force. It also goes back slightly to gravity, where not being exactly parallel(or perpendicular) with the force of gravity, adds to the phone&#39;s spiral. When spun on it&#39;s side, it holds a much more narrow center of gravity, and is far more stable - however if left to continue spinning for long enough in the air, it will begin to spiral just the same. There are also factors within the phone that may contribute to this effect, for example, heavier parts on one side of the phone compared to the other.<br>#3) I don&#39;t actually have a specific explanation for this. If it&#39;s not because of the water aligning with the cup, I&#39;m not sure what it is. :(<br>#4) The cereal is usually enriched with iron, which holds a very slight magnetic field. When a magnet is placed near the piece of cereal, the iron within responds to the magnetic field and pulls it closer to the magnet. There may also be a very weak(possibly insignificant) effect from the polarity of the water that forms from water tension.\u00a0<br>#5) When the teabag is first set on fire, the mass of the teabag keeps it down on the plate(or whatever surface). As the teabag burns, the solid mass is converted to a gas(as a product of combustion) and eventually the mass of the teabag at the very end is low enough to lift off the plate due to a few factors; Heat rises and cool air descends, the upwards propulsion when the flame reaches the bottom - because gas escapes in all directions during combustion, and because of those, it makes the effective mass of the very small piece of the teabag still on fire rise because it is lower than that of the surrounding air. The macroscale density of the teabag, also helps with this as it allows air through without much restriction - in effect making the overall mass of the teabag far smaller than it may appear so smaller pieces of material are actually less than you may assume.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-08-07T14:44:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cam P", "comment_text": "My thoughts:<br>1) Heavier side gives greater friction to slow your finger.

There are three things in the system whose motion is to be described, they are, the left and the right hands and the stick. The initial momentum of the system of elements is zero. Everything is at rest initially. Since no external forces act on the system, momentum is conserved. This implies, the final momentum of the system of elements is zero. At the final configuration, the momentum of the left and the right hands is zero because they stop at the point where they meet. This leaves us with the stick, whose momentum has to be zero. The stick may possess both translational momentum and rotational momentum. Since the two momenta cannot be added( due to the absence of dimensional homogeneity ), both should equal to zero. Coming to rotational momentum or angular momentum, which is zero, there is no flipping or rotational motion. Since it continues to stay in that configuration( constant angular velocity that is equal to zero ), we say that the net torque about the pivot( Derek&#39;s fingers ) is zero. By definition, the net torque about the center of mass of an isolated element is always zero and in this case, the system as mentioned above is isolated. This implies that the center of mass of the stick rests on Derek&#39;s fingers.<br><br>3) The electric field created by the charged insulating cup is not uniform. To be clear, take a cylindrical cup( almost identical to the one in the video ) with its bottom surface missing and let it have a uniform surface charge density. On calculating the electric field intensity at any point in space( using Gauss&#39;s law for this special symmetric situation ), one will observe that the electric field intensity follows an inverse &#39;r&#39; relationship where &#39;r&#39; is the distance from the central axis of the cylinder. As a consequence, the net force on the water molecule will not be zero. The net force on the molecule causes it to deflect from its initial flow direction. There is another possibility. Also, tap water may contain salts. Now, some salts dissolve in water, they dissociate into ions( cations and anions ). In the presence of an external electric field, the ions rearrange themselves and since the field is non-uniform, the system( water + ions ) as a whole experiences a net non-zero force thereby, causing deflections.<br><br>4) Cereals are rich in Iron. Since Iron shows magnetic properties, the cereal grain is pulled toward the magnet under special conditions. The attractive magnetic force acting on the cereal grain is more than the friction force offered by the surface of the water. This is why the cereal experiences a net force toward the magnet and so it moves toward the magnet.<br><br>5) We know that on heating an object, its density decreases.

Can&#39;t wait to know the answer!<br><br>For the first question, my guess is that u are constantly changing the speed of your hands displacement in order to preserve the stick from balancing  in one side and u naturally end up stopping in the center of gravity.<br>I tryed the experiment and here what i saw:<br>When u try to just put a finger on the center of gravity then u lift it, there are some imperfections that make the stick lean to a side and it is hard to compensate. With its inertia, the stick wants to continue to rotate and u cant hold it and at a certain point the gravitation force acts harder on a side than the other causing it to spin faster and ultimately fall. If u use two fingers slightly distant, u have more degrees of freedom to apply a force on one side or another to compensate.<br>I tryed directly putting two fingers so close in such way that the center of gravity is between them and i could lift it without problems.<br><br>For the phone experiment, i think it has to do with the torque and angular momentum. If u spin the phone so that the rotation axis is perpendicular to the screen surface, u put all the mass in the same plan. If u descretize the phone into its different blocs with their different masses and compute the overall torque vector (T=r\u00d7F, r is the vector pointing from the center of rotation to the position of the applied force f is the applied force and \u00d7 is the cross product) its axis stays the same as the initial axis of angular momentum (L=r\u00d7mv, mv is the mass multiplied by speed in other words momentum) regardless the difference of masses in the phone the angular momentum does not change axis. Since the force is provided by gravity, it is always pointing in the same direction (Stays in the rotation plan) regardless the position in the screen plan, so the change in angular momuntum does not affect the axis of rotation. Now the second experiment wouldn&#39;t give the same result because u will have some unbalanced forces in two different sides of the phone creating a new torque that has a new axis of rotation. This changes the angular momentum direction causing thes seemingly random motion. Force here is mg with g the gravitation constant and m local mass. If simply u have two different masses connected to each other and spinning around an axis in the same side the&#39;ll change their rotation axis due to this new torque caused by different forces acting on the twoo sides of the phone. I think that with more balances object it should spinn correctly regardless the initial orientation.<br><br>For the water, i can see that if u do another experiment u may have a hint of the answer. U do the same experiment but with a water that do not move put a water on a surface, and put the cup near the extremety of the waterdrop. If indeed this is caused by water polarity, the water molecules will spin and follow u. But as u said, the electric field will attract the h atoms and push the o atom with basically the same force because the size of the water molecule is so small that the gradient of the electric field will be so negligeble to enable this attraction.<br>Now when the water moves my guess is that the cause is simply magnetic. It is known that water is diamagnetic which means that when exposed to a magnetic field, it creates a field that is opposed to the field it is exposed to. That&#39;s how levitation of a frog was acheaved. When it moves near the cup, it sees an electric charge moving. As in a copper wire, moving charges cause magnetic field (u made a pretty good video on that). The magnetic field gradient when water molecules are in motion should be significantly higher than static gradient of electric field (the magnetic field decreases with the cube of the distance). Here the polarity of water molecule can play its amazing role and the applied force may be powerful enough to bend water stream.<br><br>For the serial, i don&#39;t know wether it contains ferromagnetic component or if it is due to the diamagnetic properties of water inside it or around it. Maybe if i try doing the same experiment with another thing like a smell peace of bred, and a dry peace of plastic. I would figure out an answer. Ill just wait the answer to this one.<br><br>The last experiment is amazing. I guess when burning out, the teabag exerces a force on the surface propelling it upwards. Maybe when it is hot, its density gets lower than the air which makes it go higher. This always happen anyway. I mean, fire always points upwards and smoke and burned stuff goes up. I see it as a spring pulling the whole thing up all the time and when burned up, the potential energy contained in this virtual spring transforms to kenetic energy propelling the whole thing up.<br><br>I hope my guesses arn&#39;t so wrong.

The trick is that both of your fingers apply a torque on the cane, and these must cancel out, so at all times, if the cane is to stay on your fingers, they must be on each side of the center of mass - otherwise, the torques don&#39;t cancel out. So you have two fingers moving towards each other, and you know that there is this point which they cannot cross. So they&#39;ll meet there...

On the phone, there are three main axes of rotation : one that goes through the screen, one that goes through the charging plug, all across the screen up to the power button at the top, and one that crosses the screen from left to right. The latter is the problematic one, and the reason why it is so problematic is that the moment of intertia of the phone with respect to this axis is significantly larger than that of the other two axes of rotation.

Fingers meet in the center of mass due to the fact that as your fingers slide across the cane the cane is exerting a force downward onto your fingers. Think of it as a sea-saw. As one finger slides towards the middle less force is exerted on the opposite finger and the cane wants to tilt in the direction of the opposite finger, when it does it lifts and more force is applied on the finger that is moving towards the center. When enough force is transferred to the moving finger the other finger has less force and starts to move towards the middle. Basically as the force of the stick is transferred to the moving finger which increases it&#39;s friction thus stopping it, the none moving finger has less friction and start to move to the center.\u00a0<br>(2.) Guessing due to the fact that the innards of the phone have different densities and when flipping along the long wide axis. one portion of the phone is heavier than the other side so starts to spin faster or slower and causes an in-balance.<br>(3.)

The first one is for the cane, as the fingers move closer towards the center of gravity, the length and mass on the exterior of the fingers are unequal. When that happens, the side with greater mass/length, (synonymous for this case) exhibits a greater coefficient of friction due to gravity. Not that gravity changes dependent on the object, but because one side is lopsided the finger has more &quot;push&quot; against the cane. And through multiple succession of this happening to both sides, the fingers end up at the center of gravity where friction is the highest force both fingers to meet up there.<br>The second one is for the phone. If you spin it like a ninja star the center of gravity is straight in the middle of the rectangle. The phone is free to spin around the center of gravity as if it is an axis. Throw it like a chocolate bar, the center of gravity is still in the middle, but the spin is not optimal. There is a greater amount of air friction when thrown in that style, than when like a ninja star. So the &quot;phone&quot;, (more like the system, but I&#39;m not sure if that word applies) wants to right itself into the ninja star orientation in order to get the least air resistance, so the phone wobbles. The path of least resistance does not only apply to water.<br>The third one is for the cereal. Cereal has iron in it. I don&#39;t think I need to explain much more.<br>The last on is for the tea bag. Heated air has a greater pressure than, for a lack of a better word, non-heated air. So as the flame travels the length of the tube, the insides and outsides of the tube has an increase of pressure until it finally burns through, at which point the pressure around the tube and inside the tube are no longer changing so the air all around wants to fix the differences in pressure rushing in to the space which the tube occupies.

Think of the cup as a point charge for convenience and a single water molecule. So the H2O first orients itself with the field, as it falls the distance between the point charge and H2O decrease until they are horizontally opposite (minimum distance). Now what would happen if gravity stopped acting on it? it&#39;d stay at that same distance away (ie any point with same radius). In order to move the H2O within the field requires energy input (more energy = faster rate of change)...so gravity is back working and the molecule continues on its &quot;orbital path&quot; around point charge. at this point gravity is acting tangentially to orbit thus not exerting any force to increase r thus maintain its orbital path. A fraction later a small component of gravity is exerting a force such that the radius increases, thus doing work to move charge within field.

As that finger moves, there is no friction with the rod since the force exerted by the finger at the CM balances the force of gravity of the rod and there is no normal force. However, practically there may be a small force since CM is a point while the finger represents an area of contact. However, still this ok... all of this would translate to wobbling instabilities and thus at the worst case it will momentarily imbalance the rod and tilt it minutely so that there is realy no interaction force between the rod and the finger (the rod will be deflected away from that finger), therefore, the rod is not influenced by the finger sliding. While the rod deflects away from the moving finger, it will not deflect away from the finger at the CM, since its being rotated about that point and not move relative to the CM finger. Now, as the rod swings back to touch the finger sliding, this finger momentarily minutely imbalances the rod in the same way and the process is repeated until the finger reaches the other one at the CM. Thus, the rods CM position will remain stationary (ie the rod will be still save for slight microscopic swinging) as the moving finger reaches the first finger at the CM.<br>Now lets imagine one finger being stationary and at a certain position. The other is moving and starts of at a position opposite the CM from the first. As that finger moves the rod exerts friction and moves with that finger. The CM then approaches the stationary finger. Before the moving finger reaches the stationary finger, the CM has to reach there frist (since they start out on opposite ends of the CM) so when this occurs, the first case that i described above happens and both will meet at the CM.<br>The last case is if both start out at opposite ends and are moving. Again before the fingers join, the CM has to reach one finger. At that point let&#39;s assume the finger that reached the CM is stationary and its velocity is added to the second finger (we are now in that fingers frame). Again we get to the second case (second paragrpah). Or if you don&#39;t want to look at it in frames of reference :that finger at the CM interacts with the rod through friction always now (since any swinging of the rod does not deflect the rod away from the CM position since thats the point of rotation as in situation 1) but the other finger yet to reach the first causes the rod to swing away from it momentarily as in situation 1(or theoretically and not practically... there is no normal force exerted on the moving finger and 0 friction). Therefore, the rod will be stationary relative to the finger at the CM (move at the same velocity as this finger) and the moving finger will reach the other finger at the CM without additionaly moving the rod ..basically like situation 1 except the rod is eventually moving at the same velocity as the finger that reached the CM first ,when it reaches the CM.<br><br>2) This has to do with the moment of inertia. different axis of rotation have a different moment of inertia or ease of rotation. Ease of rotation directly translates to stability.\u00a0<br><br>3)Let&#39;s say that we have one charge distribution of negative charges and another positive charge distribution per molecule. This is true because of the polar nature of the molecule. Each distribution is localised and seperated from each other. Let&#39;s join a line from the center of charge of one distribution to the center of charge of the other (like center of charge is analogous to center of mass). While the forces on each charge distribution balances, in the coordinate frame of the line joining the two CC&#39;s we can resolve the force components into a component along the line (that cancels out) and two components in opposite directions but perpendicular to the line. These cause a Torque and the line spins (the two charge distributions start rotating about a point on this line (in this case lets assume the two distributions carry the same charge magnitude and look the same ie symmetric with respect to one another, then the point of rotation will be about the center of the line). Now, due to the random orientation of the molecules, this will cause half of the molecules in the region of interaction to rotate clockwise, and half of them to rotate counter clockwise. This would cause a magnetic field about the molecule that will align the counter and clockwise rotating molecules into a north pole and a south pole. Any magnetic force exerted on this bar magnet would cause an overall net force displacing the entire set of molecules that compose this overall magnet. The magnetic force comes from the electrostatically charged cup through the spin reorganisation in the cup due to this water bar magnet (also why energy is still conserved). The water molecules would then be attracted to the cup. becuase the south pole of the cup would want to meet the north pole of the water magnet.<br><br>4) can be explained by 3) almost. The water molecules are attracted to the bar magnet and push the cereal through surface forces.\u00a0<br><br>5)flow of air, hot air rises that causes pressure to build against the circular container. When the container reduces in length, the pressure is then sufficient to squeeze the container more inwardsat the bottom relative to the top(since there is a pressure gradient).

The tube gets consumed, shrinking the inside area, so fast that the low pressure turns into high pressure, and the upwards inertia of the wind current causes causes it to continue for a moment more, lifting the tube.

[<del>]As mentioned in the video, a water molecule is polarized due to its shape. Being in a liquid state, it can freely rotate, so when a charged object (let&#39;s say {+}) gets close, the {+} of water molecules are facing away from the object (repulsed) while the {-} of the molecules are facing it (attracted); {-} sides of molecules now being closer to the object than {+} sides, water is attracted just like iron would.[</del>]\u00a0Electrons jumping from one object to another, makes the object losing electrons positively charged while the object gaining electrons becomes negatively charged, hence why they start getting attracted to each other. Same thing happens when you rub a balloon against your hair and stick it to a wall.<br>4. Cereals contain iron (at least this nugget does). We need iron in our diet, that&#39;s what makes our blood red BTW. Iron gets attracted by the magnet but it&#39;s stuck in the cereal nugget, so the whole nugget is attracted.<br>5. Same as a hot air balloon. The shape of the tea bag helps because as it burns, the air inside heats up and gets less dense than the air outside the bag. Once it reaches the bottom, remaining (and lightweight) ashes are in a volume of heated air with lesser density, it lifts up because of the buoyant force exerted by denser air around that volume.", "comment_date": "2014-08-06T20:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F!@#Guilt", "comment_text": "-The cane: as you move one finger (notice both fingers don&#39;t always move simultaneously) closer to the center of mass (COM), that side of the cane becomes heavier on that finger (weight is distributed inequally), thus greater friction keeps the finger from sliding.

When one finger is nearer to the centre of gravity, it supports more weight of the cane than the other finger, which also increases its friction (which incidentally can be proved by this - Place one finger under the centre of gravity and the other at any other point, then try to move them in turn. The finger under the centre of mass will never be the one to move), causing the finger to slow/stop and the other finger keeps moving until it is slowed down in turn. This continues until they meet.<br><br>2. The phone flip might have to do with aerodynamics... on flipping flat, of course it&#39;s very easily to give the right motion, it has good angular momentum, it cuts through the air neatly and keeps spinning. When spun around the long axis and tossed, the angular momentum is high enough to keep it spinning stably (like in case of a top), but when flipped end over end the angular momentum is so low that forces given by our hand in unintended directions come into play, and the phone tumbles.<br><br>3. I have doubts about this one. I suppose when the cup is close enough, all the molecules flip one by one (induction) so that a positive stream is towards the side of the cup and a negative stream diametrically opposite. The distance between them (the width of the stream) is enough to cause a difference in the force of attraction for the positive side and repulsion for the negative, so the stream bends. And the stream sticks together due to cohesion.<br><br>4. No idea. Doesn&#39;t work with other light objects so I suppose there has to be something magnetic in the cereal... not sure.<br><br>5.

I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s because the hot air is less dense than cooler air, so as the flame burns down and the hot air above the flame cools, you have hot air below cold air, which is a no-no, so they go ahead and switch because of the whole density thing causing the hot air (and the now extremely light with lots of surface area remnants of the tea bag) to rise.", "comment_date": "2014-08-06T16:16:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "peipeipei", "comment_text": "(1) people have already answered as friction due to imbalance of forces due to one finger being off balance and I&#39;m inclined to agree.<br><br>(2) I think this is because to flip it perfectly lengthwise requires that you release it with your thumb (or whatever finger) at the exact center of the edge of the phone to prevent torques from being applied in directions other than the one you want. It&#39;s easier to flip it on it&#39;s long axis because the same torques that would be exerted due to off center application of force are reduced in effect due to a larger moment of inertia in the non-principal direction, meaning it requires much more torque to rotate it the same amount, or also that applying the same torque rotates it much less.\u00a0<br><br>(3) The electric field exerts a force on the ions from salts or whatever normally found in water. Maybe it does&#39;t work on deionized water?

F(point) = u*N(point), where N(point) = m(point)*g. So, as you start bringing the 2 resting points together, the cane will slide more on the point where there is less partial mass.

The point where you aply the force in order to flip the phone has to be collinear with the center of mas and center of geometry. This is easier to do on the narrow side then on the broad side.

If it is the same, then (all other things being equal) the downward force must be the same on both sides, which means, that the center of mass must be in the middle between the two fingers. It stays that way until the fingers touch in the center, as each imbalance would be corrected by the same process.<br>2. No idea actually. Either something with the distribution of weight in the phone or air friction, I guess.<br>3. As water is a conductor for electricity, I would assume, that by passing the electromagnetic field of the charged cup, a current is induced, which causes it to be attracted. However, my physics mojo isn&#39;t good enough for a more detailled analysis.<br>4. Something along the lines of number 3. The cereal pulls some water up above the surface of the surrounding water and forms something like a coil, that by moving the magnet has a current induced or something.<br>5. The hot flame creates an upward draft, which initially is to small to lift the unburned tea bag. As soon, as everything is burned, the (much lighter) ashed are lifted by the remaining draft.<br><br>Looking forward to the answers (and I&#39;ll be browsing the comment section now to see, how much of an embarrassment I might be to myself.)\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-08-06T15:34:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Argentarus", "comment_text": "The cereal contains iron.", "comment_date": "2014-08-06T15:34:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Voket", "comment_text": "Cereal has Fe in it!!

If mass of the cane is M, Normal force applied by finger1 is =M*g*y/(x+y) and by finger 2 = M*g*x/(x+y). Both fingers are approaching the C.G. from both sides. Now, the two fingers are in &quot;relative&quot; motion to each other, so its obvious that the cane surface cannot remain &quot;relatively&quot; stationary to both the fingers simultaneously. Initially when you start moving the fingers, friction will act and slipping between the fingers and cane take place UNTIL the time one finger reaches the C.G. first. Lets say finger 1 reaches the C.G. first. Therefore, the value of x becomes 0 at that time. Since, x=0, then normal force by finger 2 is also 0 by the formula I had stated above. Since, normal force by finger 2 is zero, the frictional force between the cane and the finger 2 is also zero.<br><br>Lets see what happens after this moment. Two cases are possible.<br><br>Case 1: The coefficient of friction is high enough that only static friction occurs between finger 1 and the cane. Since only static friction is in play, finger 1 and cane will have no &quot;relative motion&quot; and so C.G. always remains coincident with finger 1.<br>And friction between the finger 2 and cane will continue to be zero always. Thus, finger 2 will simply slip on the cane&#39;s surface without any friction or relative motion between them.

Hopefully I&#39;m right on a few of these. First the short answers:<br><br>1) The finger farther away from the center of mass has a smaller frictional force than the other finger, so the finger farther away will slide more. This repeats until the two fingers have met up at the center of mass. (more detail below)<br><br>2) I think this one has to do with the phone being more difficult to rotate in some directions than others (has to do with its moment of inertia in different directions), making it hard for humans to spin the phone in the way shown in the video without also spinning it a little bit the other way. (more detail below)<br><br>3) The water molecules will rotate, but I would suspect this creates an overall difference in the distribution of charge in the whole water stream, which is a large enough distance to take advantage of the non-constant electric field coming from the cup (like how a neutrally charged non-conductor can be attracted to a charged object because it becomes polarized). I really don&#39;t know if there actually is a great enough difference in the electric field coming from the cup for this to work on individual atoms, but the electric field from the cup is not really that constant (more thoughts below).<br><br>4) Cereal has a lot of iron in it?<br><br>5) When the teabag is nearly all burnt, it has a pretty small mass, which can be lifted by the rising column of hot air it is sitting in.<br><br><br>Now, the more detailed explanations:<br><br>1) The finger closer to the center of mass has a higher normal force (net torque is zero, so both fingers exert the same torque. Torque is FxR, so the finger closer to the center of mass has has lower R, so it must exert a larger force to keep things balanced). This means that the finger closer to the center of mass has a higher force of friction because the force of friction is proportional to the normal force, so it will slide less than the finger farther away.\u00a0<br><br>2) . The phone has much smaller moments of inertia (smaller moment of inertia means easier to turn) when it is flipped with the axis of rotation going through the screen or lengthwise down the phone, compared to if the axis of rotation is going across the phone. This means that when you spin the phone with the axis of rotation going across the phone, it is really easy to mess up and get it spinning in another direction. I did a test where I put my phone on the edge of a table and then pushed it over, and the phone rotated perfectly with the axis of rotation across the phone, so I don&#39;t think there is something weird with the phone because it is possible to rotate the phone this way. I also tested similarly shaped objects like DVD cases (which have similar moments of inertia about the different axis because they&#39;re shaped similar to the phone), and they exhibited the same behavior as my phone both when I tossed them in the air and when I pushed them off the edge of the table.<br><br>3) \u00a0Such a small and curved cup placed so far away from the stream would certainly produce a non-constant electric field, but you might be right that it is not a steep enough gradient to affect individual atoms.

In addition, air resistance is not the reason as the phone is moving too slow to really have much resistance at all and this still works in a vacuum. The real reason has to do with the properties of a rectangular prism, which is what your phone is. A rectangular prism has three axises parallel to its edges, one having the maximum moment of inertia, another having a minimum moment of inertia, and the third (unstable one) lying somewhere between the previous two. The unstable axis creates a disturbance when one tries to rotate about it.

This causes the friction exerted on that finger to be higher than that of the other. As you push them together, the came must slide over at least one of the fingers. It will slide over the one with less friction as it more quickly overcomes that finger&#39;s static friction. This lets the finger further from the COM slide closer until it is closer than the other finger, at which point the slides flip flop.

So, as long as both fingers are applying the same amount of force horizontally, one will have a slight variation in speed because it&#39;s working against a greater amount of friction.

Moment of inertia. In that direction of rotaion the moment of inertia is the highest, because the mass of the phone is distributed very inhomogenic around the axis of rotation. Also the distance of the masses is far higher than when you rotate the phone along the centre of the side with the charger connection and centre of the top side. With this high moment of inertia it is hard to get the phone to rotate along this axis fast enough to get a stabilizing gyroscopic effect.

I imagine that partially we are &quot;feeling&quot; our way to the point where the cane is balanced with each finger individually. But also, I think perhaps the cane is working to balance itself. Your motion, if incorrect, will tip the cane over. As this is about to occur, the point touching your less balanced finger will be pressing down with greater force, and thus increase the coefficient of friction, making it more difficult to move that finger laterally.\u00a0<br>2. The phone. This I found really cool as I study rotational effects in fluids, and in spinning drops instabilities develop between different types of rotational shapes as angular momentum is increased. Yet... I can&#39;t explain this. All I can think is that there must be some unstable element in the moment of inertia about that axis. Maybe diving into the maths would help... Buuuut I&#39;m not going to do that!<br>3. The water stream. I really had always been convinced by the school explanation, but you&#39;re right, the distance between the negative and positive poles is so tiny compared to the distance to the ablloon, how could this create net movement? So what do we have?...We have a negatively charged cup, charged by stripped electrons from our hair, and we have a net neutrally charged stream made up of tiny randomly oriented magnets, whose orientation is altered by the cup to point the positive poles towards the cup. Perhaps then, it is this: Changing the orientation of water molecules creates a uniform flow of charge. This current is being accelerated by gravity, and this accelerating charge creates a magnetic field. Ugh, this is getting complex... but my guess is that it is the gravitational acceleration of aligned poles that creates a magnetic field, and it is this magnetic field which interacts with the balloon to induce the attraction.<br>4. Cheerios. I am stumped on this. Though it does remind me of the cheerio effect, where cheerios, or bubbles, floating on the surface of liquids naturally attract each other.

Since the amount of friction depends on the strength of the normal force, the friction experienced by each finger during the motion will be different for each finger. That at least partially explains the effect, but I suspect there is also a psychological factor at play -- you &quot;want&quot; to keep the cane up, so you (consciously or subconsiously) tend to move one finger faster than the other when it experiences less friction. It is the combination of these two effects that lets the fingers converge to the center of mass.<br><br><br>2. phone flip<br>-------<br>Basic rigid body dynamics shows that objects are rotationally stable when they rotate about an axis belonging to either their largest or smallest principle moments of inertia.

The distance of the negative charges in the water to the cup is therefore slightly larger than the distance of the positive charges in the water to the cup, creating a net attractive force between the water and the cup.

The cane works because whichever hand is closer to the center of mass puts a stronger normal force on the cane. This is because in order for the sum of the torques to be equal to 0, the torques on either side of the center of mass have to be equal, and because the hand closer to the cane handle is closer to the center of mass, it puts a stronger normal force onto the cane to equal with the other hand which is further from the center of mass. Because the normal force of the hand closer to the center of mass is greater, it has more friction with the cane and therefore more inclined to stay on the same location of the cane. You will also notice that as the hands move closer the cane moves left and right, this is cause by the differences in the kinetic and static coefficients of friction. While the hand closer to the center of mass does not move because its frictional force is greater, the other hand moves because its kinetic frictional force is smaller. This occurs until the hand farther from the center of mass moves close enough that its kinetic frictional force equals and then surpasses the maximum static frictional force. This causes the hand closer to the center of mass to move, giving it a smaller coefficient of friction because it is now experiencing a kinetic friction force. This allows the other hand, now closer to the center of mass, to stop and the experience a static frictional force. This process causes the cane to move side to side until the hands meet at the center of mass.<br><br>2. The phone can never have a perfect flip in that orientation because the center of mass on the phone is not directly on center (On my phone it is slightly to the left). Because rotating objects prefer to spin around their center of mass, when they are not spun around their center of mass, their rotations become unstable attempting to find a more stable rotation. This works for a similar reason as to why your Spinning Disk Trick works. (In that trick it is forced to spin around an axis normal to the point of contact with the ground because of friction, but the center of mass does not stay above that point because the center of mass of that coin is lopsided so its rotation becomes unstable and it tries to find the most stable state for its rotation) The trick does not work when spinning it around the other axes because those rotations are stable.<br><br>3. The reason the water moves toward the cup is because of the dipoles, but not individually. In the same way that individual magnetic dipoles line up in the same orientation acting as one large dipole to give magnets their magnetic fields, the electric dipoles in water line up in the same orientation to give the water its electric field. The individual dipoles line up only because the cup is charged. This is an induced dipole force, which is always an attractive force.<br><br>4. The cheerio is just an example of a paramagnet, which experiences its own small magnetic moment when exposed to an external magnetic field. This is similar to the dipole induced force, but with magnetic forces, not electric. And similarly, it is always an attractive force.<br><br>5. The tea bag floats up because as it burns it becomes less massive (not less dense) and can be swept up more easily by its smaller mass.

The magnitude of the frictional force on each finger is related to the moment of inertia of the cane with respect to each finer (a larger moment creates a larger normal force between the cane and the finger). Let&#39;s assume they are initially positioned so that one finger will experience a lesser moment than the other, resulting in a lower normal force on that finger. The net forces on each finger must be equal, but since the normal forces on each are unequal, one will experience linear force + a kinetic friction force (let&#39;s call this one the moving finger) and one will only experience a static friction force (the stationary finger); this is using the cane as frame of reference. Since the moving finger reduces the moment arm for the moment acting on the stationary finger, this moment will steadily decrease. Eventually the moments will become equal, which will cause the roles of &quot;moving&quot; and &quot;stationary&quot; fingers to reverse. This cycle will continue, and each time the moments on either side of each finger will be balanced. (In an ideal case, I think these &quot;role reversals&quot; would occur infinitely quickly, basically making it so that the fingers both steady approach the cane at different rates; however, in reality, I think it is the inconsistent coefficients of friction throughout the material causes the more sporadic phenomenon we observe). In any case, these alternation cycles will continue until the fingers reach the same position at the center of mass, the final point at the the moments on either side are balanced.<br><br>2- I&#39;m fairly certain that the batteries in iPhones are positioned closer to the left side of the phone (or possibly the right; to explain the phenomenon in the video, it doesn&#39;t really matter which). This makes the left side of the phone is heavier than the right, which throws off the center of mass slightly to the left of the center of volume. Therefore, in the third case presented, there is more angular momentum on one side of the phone than the other, inducing a torque perpendicular to the one used to flip the phone. In the first two cases, angular momentum was equal throughout the phone all along the axis of rotation, allowing only one axis of rotation.<br><br>3- This one really surprised me, I would have guessed the classic dipole explanation if you had not said it was wrong. It is worth noting that the static field around the cup is NOT a uniform electric field, and the same explanation is used for how statically charged objects can attract neutrally charged objects (e.g. a balloon picking up scraps of paper). Anyway, my best alternative guess is based on the assumption that the dipoles will orient themselves towards the center of the electric field, and that water is cohesive. So as a molecule passes from being at the same height as the cup (oriented vertically, with the hydrogen facing to the right) to being below the height of the cup, the molecule will rotate slightly counter clockwise. If you could snap a molecular picture of the stream, I believe there would be a pretty continuous gradient of angles pointing towards the center of the field as you look down the stream. This would make all the molecules behave like little arch stones - or maybe chains is a better visualization? The molecules at the height of the cup (facing right) would be fine if stacked vertically, but the molecules below the cup (rotated slightly CCW) would not want to sit vertically on top of each other since the oxygen would be directed more towards the hydrogen.<br><br>4- Water is dimagnetic, so it is repelled by magnets. My guess is that you are using a strong enough magnet to create a small divot on one side of the cereal, which causes the water on the other side of the cereal to push it towards the direction of the magnet.<br><br>5- The fire heats up the air around and within the cylinder. We all know hot air is less dense than cold air, which is why it rises. Atmospheric pressure causes cold air to flow into the space previously occupied by the hot air, which is then in turn heated up as well; the cycle continues, and viola, we have a upward, vertical convection air current. At some point, the mass of the cylinder will become so low that this current carries the cylinder up along with it.", "comment_date": "2014-08-06T10:44:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RustyOldShoe", "comment_text": "Cereal contains loads of iron, that&#39;s why you can pull it.", "comment_date": "2014-08-06T10:44:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jamesnixonsteel", "comment_text": "Maybe the components inside the iPhone make it spin off axis because its not uniform mass inside", "comment_date": "2014-08-06T10:44:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Torbax", "comment_text": "Well the cereal one is easy, cereal contains loads of iron and with low friction in the water gets pulled easily by a strong magnet...

The amount of force that needs to be applied to corners so that they make the full rotation in some period of time grows, as I know, quadratically with the length of the side.

Due to the resistance of the water, a voltage differential is created between the water closest to the cup (-neg) and the tap that is providing water (+pos). The water closest to the cup now has an abundance of electrons (provided by Earth through the tap) and is attracted to the positively charged cup.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xp_imnO6WE&amp;t=2m12s\">2:12</a> - Electrons are actually wiped off the cup, causing a positive charge in the electric field.<br><br>(4) The cereal is fortified with a nutritional supplement called Ferrous Fumarate - an Iron containing molecule.

I think I figured it out when Derek made asymmetric distance demonstration. The finger closer to the center of mass didn&#39;t move until the other finger got even closer. I know that frictional force relies on the normal force between the interacting objects (the cane and a finger). Normal force is derived from an object&#39;s mass if no other forces are acting on it. The farther a finger is from the center of mass/gravity, the lesser the normal force on it. When trying to move both your fingers closer to the center of mass, the one with the lesser normal force, and therefore lesser friction, will be the one to move. I suspect that when two fingers are symmetrically distant from the center of mass, that, even when converging at uniform speed, they will alternate (even if imperceptibly without sensitive measuring equipment) movement until they touch. Since the laws of physics are always in effect, even converging your fingers quickly will allow them to zero in on the center of mass.<br><br>2. I&#39;ll admit, I haven&#39;t got a clue, but I&#39;ll make an attempt. First, let&#39;s establish the axes of rotation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw. Let&#39;s imagine that each of these axes pierce the phone, so in our imaginations it literally spins on an axis. The roll axis is the one that occupies most of the phone&#39;s insides. If you were to stand the phone up on the table so it stands tall and perpendicular, the roll axis is parallel to the phone, and perpendicular to the table. Let&#39;s establish the yaw axis next. Simply put, if this axis was tangible, it would crack your screen. It occupies the least space, and it never touches the edges of the phone, like the other two axes. Finally, the pitch axis goes through the phone across its width, occupying the second most amount of space of the phone&#39;s body. For visual aid, you can Google image search &quot;roll pitch yaw&quot; and imagine that the tail of the plane is where Derek uses his thumb to hold the phone before making the complicated flip.<br><br>The only way this phenomenon fits comfortably in my head is if I imagine those axes having mass and sticking out of the phone, as if the phone was stuck with metal rods. In Derek&#39;s first flip, the phone rotates in a way that the ends of the yaw axis don&#39;t travel, while the other two axes are whirling in mid air. The second flip Derek does has the phone spinning on the roll axis, while the pitch and yaw are the ones whirling through the air. The last one is the one that gets me. For some reason, rotating the phone about the pitch axis causes the other axes to want to take over. I can remember some of Derek&#39;s other videos on rotation, where he explains that figure skaters can slow down by retracting their arms, or speed up by extending their arms. Perhaps, the reason for our current phenomenon lies in the reason for the figure skater phenomenon. Perhaps making a rectangle like a phone rotate about the pitch axis requires more energy than spinning \u00a0about both the other axes combined. If the phone were perfectly square, then the roll and pitch axes would be indistinguishable, and maybe this phenomenon wouldn&#39;t occur under those conditions. But since the phone is rectangular, I suspect that it costs less energy to spin on both the roll and yaw axes, so trying to spin on the pitch would make itself shift to the less costly rotation (maybe the laws of rotational physics prevent the phone from rotating about the pitch axis at all, and Derek was only giving the illusion that he was, all the while rotating the phone about the roll and yaw axes from a different starting point. Although, I&#39;m not too confident about my claim).<br><br>3. I feel like I&#39;ve been lied to in school (not that such a thing is unheard of). You know, I think the fact that a polar molecule is more significant than what the molecule is. What I&#39;m trying to say is, I don&#39;t think the fact that it&#39;s water means anything. Seriously, this could be done with balloons on cupboards, or plastic wrap on just about anything. Neither of those things are &quot;magnetic&quot;. It&#39;s just van der Waals interaction. Why does that suddenly change when the molecule is in the water state at room temperature? I don&#39;t think it does. I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here and say it&#39;s van der Waals attraction pulling the water to an electrically charged surface.<br><br>4. Similar to number 3. Actually, I can think of two possible solutions (and it might just be that one doesn&#39;t preclude the other). The first is that breakfast cereals tend to be porous, which means it absorbs some water. That water is then attracted to the magnet because of the water&#39;s polar property, as I explained for phenomenon 3 (I might be wrong about it, but no one can deny water&#39;s polar tendencies). Derek might have said to use a strong magnet because now there is a layer between the magnet and the water--the cereal--which means an electrically charge piece of plastic won&#39;t cut it anymore. Since the water is inside the cereal, the cereal, due to normal force (or, if I&#39;m right about 3, van der Waals attraction), has no choice but to move along with the water.<br><br>The second explanation I can think of comes from what I think is fluid dynamics. Since the water is attracted to charged surfaces, it naturally wants to move closer to the magnet. If the water moves away from an area, it reduces the pressure from that area, and more water moves in to equalize the pressure. If the cereal is near the area, it will be moved to the low pressure area due to drag (and possibly van der Waals forces that tug the cereal when the water moves).<br><br>If this phenomenon works with a particle that is both less dense than water and not at all porous or absorbent, then the second explanation will more true than the first one. If the phenomenon fails to work with a particle that is both less dense than water and not at all porous or absorbent, then the first explanation is true, and the second one is false.<br><br>5. Similar to my second explanation for number 4--fluid dynamics (I think). Also, a gas law. Combustion reactions produce heat, and that heat warms the surrounding air. Charles&#39;s law states that as a gas&#39;s temperature goes up, so does its volume. A substance&#39;s density is simply the ratio of its mass to its volume. Since the air can&#39;t lose mass (law of conservation of mass), but its volume goes up, its density is decreased. When fluids mix, the least dense fluid rises to the top. In this case, the two fluids are room temperature air, and the warmer air that was heated by the flaming teabag. As the room temperature air gets warmer, its density decreases, and it travels upward. Since that air is out of the way, the pressure of the area it left is lower than other areas. The air that rushes to equalize the pressure difference comes from below, since it was unaffected by the heat and never flew up to create the low pressure. As the cooler air below rushes upward to fill the void, it creates drag as it rubs up against the teabag. When enough of the teabag is burned away the drag pulling it upwards overcomes the force of gravity pulling it downwards, and so it (surprise, surprise) moves upward. In truth, this teabag is a rocket as about as much as smoke, soot, and ash are rockets.<br><br>Well, I think those explanations should suffice. As watching videos from this channel have told me before, many of the things I thought I knew were wrong, so it might just well be that my explanations are wrong as well.

The weight asymmetry of the phone probably helps the extra rotation, but I think this would work with an even piece of wood too. I believe this has more to do with the proportions of the object and the way we&#39;re applying the force to make it spin: the thumb is not perfectly centered nor does it apply exactly the same force on both sides of it.

Brilliant deconstruction of the traditional explanation, I was very surprised! What I can think of is that once we turn the molecules around, we have a stream of charged sides.

This continues until they reach an equilibrium and from that point on they close in at the same rate, just slightly ajusting the balance because of errors caused by differences in friction coefficients in both fingers and along the surface of the cane.\u00a0<br><br>2. Think of the phone as having a ball of mass in both top and bottom half.<br>If you spin it in the plane of the screen those two balls act like two kids rotating holding hands, the centrifugal force keeps them moving in a circle and because the direction of that force is always in the exact plane of the rotation any changes that plane might take has to overcome that force that pulls it back into the plane. As the mass off to the side of the rotational plane is almost directly at the plane iself it can&#39;t really put up much force.<br>If you rotate the phone along the longer center you get a similar effect. But there is a large part that acts vastly different. In this case there is a lot of mass not along the rotational plane but along the center of the rotation itself. A large part of the phones mass is in the center of the rotation, making the influences of any other parts of the phone pretty insignificant. Also, because the other parts of the phone are close to the center themselves they only have a short lever sideways to unstabilise the phone, but a long lever in the direction of the center of rotation to counter any instabilities.<br>If you now rotate the phone along the short center both effects work in the opposite direction. A large part of the mass is far away from the center of the rotation leaving almost nothing to stabilize the center. There isn&#39;t really a singular plane of rotation, but if you think of two, one on each side of the phone, you&#39;ve got some great levers there, where each little instability can do some great things to the other side. Also the mass is distributed everywhere and can&#39;t stabilise itself with a big centrifugal force in a single direction.<br><br>3. The static elecricity polarises the water and then pulls it towards it. The cup basically is an electromagnet inducing a current into the water that also creates an electromagnetic field.

Many things from moving stock to throwing in Ju-jitsu stress the importance of applying force as close to the center of gravity as possible for this very reason.<br><br>Phone: leverage and gyroscopic motion. When you flip the phone, force (and counterforces) is exerted on all 3 axes at the same time. In the 1st 2 flips the leverage granted to one axis far far exceeds the leverage placed on the others and can get drowned out, and the spin can be maintained through gyroscopic motion. However the amount of leverage on the third flip isn&#39;t strong enough to overcome the other axes (especially air resistance) and gyroscopic motion isn&#39;t attained on said axis.<br><br>Cup and Water: My guess would be Bernoulli&#39;s Principal. Similar to how moving air lifts a wing and how running water pulls a hanging spoon to it. This cup has generated an EM field around it and is generating more &quot;pressure&quot; on one side of the falling water than the other, so the water is &quot;encouraged&quot; to follow the pressure as much as it can. Even though the water is both attracted and repelled by this force, its a little resistant to changing its environment (leaving the field) and tries to stay with it for a little while.<br><br>Cereal: as someone said before, many cereal contains Iron which can be affected by magnetic forces. This is true, but in reality everything is techinally magnetic... to a degree. Its just that the things we see as magnetic are just hundreds of times more sensitive to it than other elements. In this experiment I believe its not just the Iron that is pulling to the magnet but the starch, sugars, and the water itself (again to a very tiny degree). due to it free floating in water we can observe the tiny degree to some extent.<br><br>Teabag: Alot of it has to do with the orientation of the teabag as it&#39;s standing and how light it is (and becomes as it burns).

My theory sees everything as fluid creating high and low pressure areas. When one moves to another it&#39;s to balance out those pressures. Water moving to the cup is due to the high pressure static energy moving to the water. The water falling creates low pressure gaps as it falls. The water it self is high pressure. Energy moving toward the low pressure gaps in the water create its own gaps as it moves which pull the water in. I like to think of it as a better way to think of Einstein relativity theory thingy lol. Or I could be way wrong, but that&#39;s half the fun finding the answer. If I&#39;m right though the high pressure from the cup will push the water away at the right distance rather than pull it due to the lack of low pressure in the area, but it may not be visible on something that small though.<br><br>4.
