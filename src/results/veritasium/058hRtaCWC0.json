We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..<br><br>Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .<br><br>All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T07:44:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ben M", "comment_text": "Baymax", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T07:29:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jay pee", "comment_text": "It only dawned on me near the end that they are wearing masks because of the pandemic, not because they are working with robots.", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T07:16:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J K", "comment_text": "I can see myself with a soft robot in my room in future.", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T06:49:31Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "iamthinking2252 _", "comment_text": "and last year, Machines That Bend Are Better", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T06:48:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DanielKzy", "comment_text": "looks like something you can probably find in Atomic Heart", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T06:34:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thefatt1988", "comment_text": "It is safe until some clown think it is funny to put a finger inside the moving gear.", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T05:59:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anup Bhatt", "comment_text": "This video got me thinking.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..<br><br>Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019.<br><br>All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T23:07:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Velocity Duck821", "comment_text": "Why one would want soft robots?<br>Robot: &quot;Knee before your overlord Lord Softee&quot;.<br>Humanity: Takes out knitting needles.", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T23:06:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "diamondflaw", "comment_text": "Tadashi Hamada would like to know your location.<br>EDIT: Oh hey, there&#39;s the callout at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=058hRtaCWC0&amp;t=9m12s\">9:12</a>", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T23:03:17Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jaime Jimenez", "comment_text": "That octahedron robot is honestly a very cool project, and to have built it with a buddy and have NASA reach out to you is a big accomplishment!", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T22:44:55Z", "likes_count": 46}, {"comment_by": "SpecterSeventy2", "comment_text": "This red bending robot looks like a pool noodle and a lonely terminator had a baby.", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T22:44:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aaron M.

And some places have a greater pressure than others especially like the deep underwater Laurentian Abyss or lighter pressure areas where your robot won&#39;t need as much . However higher or lower temperatures can change the type of pressure that you can apply to any liquid or gas. If you&#39;re in somewhere that is too hot or too cold such a space or near a volcanic vent. Sudden Change in temperature her or drastic temperatures might make it hard to inflate all those are easy situations to overcome. An acidic atmosphere could be problematic or out in space we&#39;re tiny debris could shoot past high speeds, getting poked with much tiny holes would be Mission ending. My solution of course is nanotechnology. We could create robots so small inside of this mechanism that would allow it to heal itself with packages of repair material that can just be applied on any Gap whatsoever. We could also pressure contain segments similar to the Titanic only this would be helpful to stop the leak of vital gases during repair by opening and closing irus shutters or sphincters. If we lose all of our gas out in space it could be possible we can use plants and or pressure containers even tiny little ones to make more of the type of gas we need. Plants could even be used to turn atmosphere from one type to another so terraforming Mars while they operate", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T12:04:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Warner", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=058hRtaCWC0&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> &quot;One of the things that I like to do is just to take the robot and kind of like beat it up&quot;<br>*Robot overlords will remember that", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T12:03:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ismail Ibrahim", "comment_text": "Bender Bending Rodr\u00edguez approves this video", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:58:49Z", "likes_count": 37}, {"comment_by": "m_ micke", "comment_text": "Damn dude that&#39;s Nice car", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:57:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florian H", "comment_text": "he kinda looks like theodd1sout with a beard lol", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:54:07Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Elvijus", "comment_text": "he lost me when he said that they use inches", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:53:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "I'm Out", "comment_text": "One thing leads to another...", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:49:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christine Cameron", "comment_text": "They are thinking of like, exploring Mars and the Moon, but I can see how this tech could be a great help in the care of elderly and wheelchair-bound, to allow much easier lifting and movement in a more comfortable manner.", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:49:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Siemons", "comment_text": "Big Hero 6 incoming?", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:48:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "halogenic", "comment_text": "Kiwico looks great but seems they don&#39;t ship to Japan.", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T11:47:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julika7", "comment_text": "I immediately had to think of Baymax.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..<br><br>Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed..
