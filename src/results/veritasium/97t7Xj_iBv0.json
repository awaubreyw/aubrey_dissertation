It was a reed that vibrated against a ratchet wheel.  The vibration of the reed was due to resonant vibration induced by an electromagnet driven by 60hz voltage.  We had all kinds of fun adjusting the reeds and modifying the grooves in the ratchet wheel.  <br>However we did not experiment with a non 60 Hz source. I would figure that a non 60Hz voltage applied to the reed would not successfully vibrate it unless it met the natural fundamental resonance of the reed.  If we could have tuned the frequency of the AC voltage I would suspect we could have sped up the cars immensely.  However, we could already tune them up to the point that they couldn&#39;t make the corners and go flying off the table.  But it would have been even more fun to make them fling across the room.<br>In this sense it you made the vibrating reed to be resonant with only a fairly precise frequency plus heavily damped then external vibration could not move it and only the exact frequency could.

Axles can be easily repaired/replaced, whereas a bend point is constantly stressed with use, which leads to micro-cracking, cracking/tearing, and eventually irreparable failure. Ever taken a paper clip and bent it back and forth until the wire broke? That&#39;s basically what&#39;s going on with this prototype tool every time you use it. That means the entire piece has to be a good spring steel, and must undergo a proper manufacturing, hardening, and tempering process. Worse in this particular design, however, is now you have to build it out of differential steels (the spring areas spring steel and the jaws tool steel), and you must also figure out how to temper the spring section to spring temper whilst keeping the jaws as hardened as possible.... Differential materials and differential hardening/tempering processes... Lots of costs associated, when a Vice Grip is just tool steel jaws on heavy stamped/cast mild steel components, with a spring and a screw mechanism... Even simpler and cheaper is a generic slip-joint pliers; two cut/forged/cast lengths of tool steel with jaws and a joint on one end, and a heavy-duty fastener through them as a fulcrum point....<br><br>Further, an axle can still function to near-capacity all the way to the point of failure, whereas this particular bend point tool is going to have a wild degradation in performance as it goes from factory new to irreparable failure. With the very first squeeze, you&#39;re imparting stress onto a rigid structure, which leads to microscopic breakages of said internal structure which weaken the spring as less tensile strength is possible... Worse yet, as the spring continues to wear over time and use, it will start to &quot;sag&quot;, meaning it won&#39;t return to its initially designed rested position, but fall somewhere inside its normal range of motion, until it either fails or has sagged to the point it no longer functions as designed. This is typical of firearm magazine springs when the magazine has been left loaded for a long period of time (typically 15-20 years). A good stretch of the spring will fix feeding issues, though the spring is weakened and will deform again (faster this time). At this point, the mag is best used as a spare range mag, because the reliability will be forever questionable.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are plenty of great applications for bendy parts; tie rods, leaf springs, Russian rear rifle sights, thruster cages, shock mounts for microphones, big fat juicy bass guitar strings, etc. etc. etc... But some things should just be left simple... Like pliers... Cuz pliers shouldn&#39;t bend; they should be rigid and impart much squeezing force multiplied by the factor of levers....<br><br>:)", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T16:27:47Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Ziigmund", "comment_text": "Women already new about this long time ago.", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T16:22:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SMB\u0915\u0930", "comment_text": "This video one of your&#39;s my favourite thanks sir", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T14:17:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brytsk Nguyen", "comment_text": "parts count: so if you break one piece, you basically throw away the whole thing?", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T13:39:00Z", "likes_count": 1124}, {"comment_by": "Charan Teja", "comment_text": "blown away!!!! amazing", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T13:30:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BBnose", "comment_text": "it reminds me the logo of Aphex Twin", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T10:37:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heinz LETZTE.", "comment_text": "y girlfriends that bend are better", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T07:54:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "onezerotwofour", "comment_text": "I put my lunches in containers that have a lid that can attach with latches which snap into place.<br>The problem is that the plastic they are made of is required to bend and eventually it wears out and simply breaks-off entirely and I cannot attach the lid as intended.<br><br><br>Despite the points raised in the video, my lunch storage issue makes me disagree with the assertion that &quot;machines that bend are better&quot; (at least for all applications).", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T07:35:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mort Kebab", "comment_text": "The fact that you can just drop in on Physics Girl means you probably work for the same people, Levi and co.

The microswitch inside it has a diaphragm flexure and the top casing flexes when you press on it to transmit the compressive force. Older mouse models had separate distinguishable buttons, now its all one piece.<br>3. Cable ties have a very small tooth with a flexure that engages a rack. You can often reuse cable ties by disengaging the tooth from the rack using a pin and pull out the rack while holding tooth off the rack with the pin.<br>4. All plastic components of every product you use has a snap fit for assembly - no requirement of fasteners.<br>5. Every book uses live hinges (crease where you bend) for opening and closing.<br>6. Some cheap click type ball point pen (e.g. Bic retractable pen) uses flexures to keep the extended pen nib in its position.<br>7. Tic tac box uses living hinge for the lid.<br>8. Volume rockers on your cell phone uses flexures instead of springs to bounce back<br>9. If you have a wind up pendulum clock, the pendulum is suspended by a flexure for avoiding friction caused by use of a pivot.<br>10. Snap fit locks for straps in duffle bags/backpacks etc.<br>11. Some shot microphone mounts uses flexures for vibration isolation.<br>12. Camera lens covers uses flexures for springs for holding the cover on the lens.<br>13. Disposable food containers, clamps for IV lines.<br>14. Paper clips.<br>15. Foldable plastic forks found in ready to eat noodles have a living hinge in the middle for folding.<br>16. Leaf springs in vehicle suspension (Thanks to Heartycoffee in the comments for suggestion).<br>17. Tweezers and forceps (Thanks to randal gibbons in the comments for suggestion)<br>18. Safety pins (Thanks to DrBrainSol in the comments for suggestion)<br>19. Accordion-style toilet plunger (Thanks to Gary Young in the comments for suggestion)<br><br>\u00a0p.s. I will add more to the list later.

I&#39;m sure that for very specific application where a part is designed with on goal in mind it&#39;s great, but I&#39;ll take a traditional vice grip. <br>For example, if anyone has ever tried to repurpose a tic-tac container(for holding tiny screws or small tools) you would know that the flap that keeps the container open or closed is designed to bend, and is also where they tend to fail first. When I&#39;ve fixed electronics, the number one point of failure in most cases was either a spring or a piece of plastic that was designed to bend or apply tension; i&#39;ve had to replace the springs in my playstation controller about 5 times. I&#39;ve also worn glasses all my life, and the part that always breaks first is the nose guards, which are supposed to bend to fit the shape of your nose. <br>Unless there is some new unknown element discovered that can realign at an atomic level, I can&#39;t see how things that are designed to bend are supposed to be a solution to moving parts, which do suffer from mechanical wear, but for the most part provide consistent performance up until the point of failure. I&#39;ll take sudden failure over a gradual decline in performance, but that&#39;s just my opinion.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T23:49:35Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Sportsquirrel", "comment_text": "Looks like the ideal process to make Theo Jansen&#39;s strandbeast.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T23:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sky King", "comment_text": "Who knew?

So this might be interesting for some cases but the video presented it as the best thing for every case and without any scientific scepticism. But as a scientist you shouldn&#39;t be fanboying something so easily.<br>About the satellite thrusters: This whole element was superfluous. There were two motors. You can already archive the movement with just two motors, no need for flexible parts. Actually they just provide another potential point of failure. Especially in space you want to avoid that. That&#39;s why they prefer a second thruster (also this provides redundancy). Also space is pretty bad for plastics. So this example was pretty bizarre (to say it mildly).", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T03:53:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Iceberg Iceberg", "comment_text": "The device that writes BYU definitely stands for Brigham Young University.

Not sure if the same concept would work in 3d printing with sls; it&#39;s the same concept, melting metallic powder with a laser, but, as far as I know, sls is much, much weaker in comparison. <br>Going back to the idea of having a transitional alloy, the laser metal deposition form of additive manufacturing could, in theory, create a perfect gradient with a multi-alloy transition; as the amount of the powder can be controlled, you can go from a blend of 0% metal A and 100% metal B through an alloy gradient that ends at 100% metal A and 0% Metal B.

The fact that such tech for safely arming nuclear weapons disappears behind the fence is kind of terrifying. I mean I can understand from a national security aspect that countries don\u2019t want the specifics of the designs of their nuclear weapons to fall into foreign governments hands. But the truth of the mater is that a lot of what makes designing nuclear weapons difficult is the refining of the uranium not necessarily the tech in the bomb itself. But it also means that no one on the outside can actually verify what\u2019s actually being used. It\u2019s all fine and good to say that we trust that the best minds, the best intentions, the best everything went into the design. And it\u2019s undoubtably true. But without any ability to verify it also means taking the military\u2019s word for it. There is no equivalent of pubic patents or consumer protection laws or third party safety tests and verifications. No years of patent law and mistakes and trial and error stemming from public accidents and unforeseen mistakes etc. Of course you can\u2019t have such things with nuclear weapons lol. I\u2019m not saying they weren\u2019t tested but that the results of said test are a black box to the public.  So you design them as fault prone as you can, and rest every bit to death. I have no doubt these are probably some of the safest devises ever built. But... I also have to take the military\u2019s word for that, and the fact that they have never gone off by accident.

Need high tensile strength, but also large range of elastic deformation. Come to think of it; this is the realization of mechanical systems developed prior to invention of hydraulic systems. The force in these mechanical systems is concentrated in smallest parts of the geometry, forcing any future advancements to come as a result of new, better, materials being invented. In hydraulics large force is excreted on large parts of the system while pressure is being kept constant; resulting in ability to use large chunks of weak materials to generate large forces.", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T05:19:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Pruent", "comment_text": "Are enzymes made of compliant materials?  @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97t7Xj_iBv0&amp;t=8m35s\">8:35</a> that thing reminds so much of protein complexes.", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T05:18:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MPIronmanJC", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97t7Xj_iBv0&amp;t=7m06s\">7:06</a> And that&#39;s how nanobots will be made", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T05:16:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BYU Compliant Mechanisms Research Group", "comment_text": "Thanks for featuring us Derek!

Aren&#39;t these systems just a collection of springs, which function as energy storage devices in a macroscopic system with discrete &quot;low&quot; energy states? The flexible materials are a good addition to these systems reducing the need for high precision joints, but ultimately these are two separate things: material science and state machines with discrete energy states. Also, the flexible material part has a downside, strength. The 3d printed vice grips are cool, but the amount of force you can generate in them depends on strength of the flexible part of that geometry. The flexible titanium item IS really cool, but how much distortion can it support when a side load is applied due to change in angle of the top plane? And yes, i guessed the elephant part correctly. How do you design an elephant like that? Easy, you have 3 points to consider, tip of the trunk, top of the trunk and middle of the trunk. Then you design the rest of the geometry (at that point geometry does not even need to be an elephant) such that top and middle support points of the trunk move along the circumferences of 2 circles that are centered at the point where you want the tip of the trunk to remain.", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T05:03:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Cummings", "comment_text": "This is seriously one of the most amazing videos I have seen all year.

So, best case, it will have at least 32 pieces, but as many 54 or more.<br><br>Back in the day there was a company called Magnus that used plastic.  Instead of a reed plate with 10 reeds held on with 10 rivets it molded the reed plates.  2 cover plates, two reed plates, 1 comb.  5 pieces total, glued together. <br><br>And harmonicas are flexible machines.  Each reed is attached to the reed plate on one end and the other end swings.  Reeds are made of phosphor-bronze, brass or stainless steel... interestingly, anecdotally at least, the stainless steel reeds last virtually forever for light players but seem to blow out even quicker for hard players.  My theory is that because steel has a small swing range that it can cycle through without fatiguing that light players are staying under that threshold, but harder players are going over it, at which point, as a harder metal, it fatigues faster.  (My math isn&#39;t good enough to calculate the total arc of the swing along the length to check it against the numbers I&#39;ve found for the metals though.)<br><br>I&#39;ve gotten in arguments with customizers (a standard &#39;good&#39; harmonica will run $40 but customizers can get $400) about whether a machine could align the reeds as exactly.  My bet was it could, but maybe not in a cost effective way for the industry at its size- more people want wrenches than harmonicas.  There is some &#39;art&#39; to it- you have to get reeds close to choking so that a slight change in technique can choke the reed when you want it to- reeds operate in pairs and to get advanced notes you need to choke one reed.  When I see not just how advanced new technologies are getting, but how customizable they are...<br><br>It makes me wish I had a degree in computer aided design.  :(<br><br>Edit-<br>It should, of course, be pointed out that a million cycles on an instrument is not the same as on a wrench.  Those Magnus harmonicas, every one I&#39;ve tried, is pretty broken while old metal harmonicas sometimes are worth more than new one (lead in old bell brass... some people swear by it).  At A 446, an A harmonicas low note could blow through a million swings in no time-  37 minutes.   (Although obviously if you played that one note for 37 minutes you&#39;d have pretty boring song, but there are 3 A&#39;s above it on a diatonic A harp, each with 2x the frequency, so the top one would be less than 10 minutes, and there are higher harps.)", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T02:25:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xtubby420x", "comment_text": "Damn.

However the strength is another very important consideration, How strong would that Thin titanium hinge be compared to a traditional ceramic deep grove ball bearing of similar size and weight. further more the titanium hinge looked like it would have been very poor with any potential axial loading, though I am not sure if that would be an important consideration considering spacecraft tend to not change attitude too quickly like you can in kerbal space program\ud83d\ude01 so axial loading might not be that important. One thing to note is that design of the hinge would also act as a shock absorber at the same time as performing the job of a bearing and return spring, which is important if you want to survive the vibrations during launch, so effectively it takes the job of three different entire subsystems all with one part. And the same goes for the engine gimbal which I had no idea you could even make out of one part like this, though you still have the motors as separate parts (for now). Absolutely amazing!

The world is a simulation/a physical zoo/we&#39;re a planet sized ant farm made by a practically unfathomably advanced civilization and we\u2019re all essentially the property/characters for beings in a different/higher dimension than us. What we think is our reality is essentially a toy world for another civilization. We\u2019re all controlled via what I call a Sensory Manipulation Cloud (SMC) The symptoms of schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder THE SAME as consciously experiencing the SMC (something we&#39;re not supposed to be able to do, but can do by thinking through your actions always choosing the best/most moral action, strengthening our 5 senses, being loving, working hard and staying lighthearted). For these reasons (and luck) I\u2019m more conscious or experiencing consciousness on a higher level than the rest of society. I meditate a lot, I don\u2019t smoke weed or do any hallucinogens (I do smoke cigarettes). I&#39;m guessing whatever civilization owns us, the ratio their to our existences is Human to Petri Dish or Human to Animal; meaning they&#39;re viewing us through completely different paradigm, probably like owning property. Schizophrenia and certain mental disorders are a preemptive crippling of people who they know have a higher chance of having high awareness/ being conscious/being aware of the simulation and the peculiarities that reveal we&#39;re in a simulation (Autistic Savants? Highly Empathetic Intelligent people with mental disorders?).<br><br>Schizophrenia<br><br>Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you&#39;re being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.<br><br>Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don&#39;t exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.<br><br>Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can&#39;t be understood, sometimes known as word salad.<br><br>Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn&#39;t focused on a goal, so it&#39;s hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.<br><br>Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn&#39;t make eye contact, doesn&#39;t change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may have lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.<br><br>Schizophrenia/ Dissociative - Delusion Grandeur, Seeing patterns, Highlighted Coincidence, Hearing Voices, Word Salad, Persecution, Inability to Distinguish Internal External Forces. Sudden Loss of Memory, Emotional Catatonia, Extreme Changes in Perception (like you\u2019re in movie, looking at yourself from above) Imagining voices coming from other people or objects<br><br><br>EXPERIENCING THE SMC CONSCIOUSLY SMC,<br><br>Sensory Manipulation Cloud, [ [functions as a manipulable optical illusion, essentially you&#39;re living in a PHOTOSHOP/SPECIAL FX bubble]] \u2013 an undetectable amorphous cloud made of light, is on every human on earth. Manages our personality in two ways, a thicker membrane that\u2019s closer to the face, and I think it thins out into a cloud further away from the body. The membrane on the face manipulates and shapes our face/emotions/lips movements. The outer cloud alters how we perceive the world. The entire cloud is invisible to all of us for some reason but I\u2019ve started becoming aware of mine a few years ago. This cloud is adjusted by degrees smaller than a pin point to affect our perception ( make the world seem bigger, smaller, affect motor skills by toying with our visual perception, can be adjusted to make the world appear scary/moody, beautiful, cinematic/movie like/slower/faster/ more open/ more claustrophobic, make it look like you have four arms, can subtly highlight certain things to make you form certain patterns/superstitious like beliefs like noticing a certain color everywhere suddenly, make a person look bigger than you [a person looks than bigger than you if you admire or are intimidated by them], subtly/suddenly changing your perception mid-thought so you forget suddenly what you&#39;re thinking/brain fart, highlight people or thinking, subtly make the cloud denser in certain places so you don&#39;t focus on an object or information. Pay attention to when you read, you&#39;ll notice you skip over certain words [this is done to control our paradigms, and what we absorb, I&#39;m guessing after a lifetime of being manipulated this way a person&#39;s personality can be guided ]) I\u2019m assuming every human&#39;s SMC cloud is unique like an IP address. The SMC densities can be altered to recreate different sensations, Everyone has emotions and each of those emotions have corresponding feelings . The SMC can be fine tuned over and over to mimic feelings and their corresponding sensations, until we&#39;re controlled in a pavlovian/reward-response/manipulable way. I don&#39;t know why the SMC can&#39;t be detected by the typical eye or even scientific equipment.<br><br>OUR GAMER can show us images in this cloud, usually based on what you&#39;re thinking, so it&#39;s easier for you to accept the images. You can form a conversation/theme/dialogue with someone you think is in your head but your gamer just uses something the mind naturally does . When you think a question or statement, your brain thinks of expected responses .

The raw material is fairly soft but if you only add a little bit of carbon intentionally or not, in very small portions we are talking under 0,8% by mass. Those carbon atoms will set them self between the iron Kristal structure or even displace a Fe atom. those are 0-Dimensional Errors in the Kristal structure of materials. And it gets up Volume defects which are errors of the 3d Dimension I could keep on talking but basically, the purer an Element is the more flexible it is and if you have more alloy elements the more brittle it gets. Think of gold 24 carats (99.99%Au) is very soft and 18 carat is much harder and brittle. (But copper and gold and silver get work hardened unlike other materials they become soft when you heat them and fastly cool them down after) As you can see I really like MaterialScience and it is a topic id love to see you make a video about because it brings so much to the table and there are so many interesting things to learn.<br><br><br>I Love your videos and hope to learn more with you in the future. <br><br><br><br><br>Ps: I am a German second semester \rgerman german german <br>automation technology student and love to learn with you and the sciences community on youtube.", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T20:30:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S\u00e9bastien Gari\u00e9py", "comment_text": "Save the world?????", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T20:29:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "auther tevin", "comment_text": "This is one of the best channels i had the privilage to sub to..ive learned something new today..simply incredible.", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T20:29:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BrCks House", "comment_text": "They made springs.", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T20:29:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No Name", "comment_text": "Can somebody explain me how the nuke safety works?
