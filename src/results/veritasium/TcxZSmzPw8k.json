I don&#39;t recall for certain if Jon Stewart has met Neil deGrasse Tyson, but I know Stephen Colbert has. I can easily believe that I&#39;m six degrees or fewer from most people in the world. If we&#39;re talking just meeting people, I&#39;m one degree from a few famous actors, which puts me two or three degrees from a lot of Hollywood. Two degrees from Jon Stewart puts me three or four degrees at most from Obama, Malala, Neil Tyson, Matt Mercer, and so many others. I&#39;ve also got two degrees to George Bush Sr. It&#39;s also crazy how fast you can go into the past. IIRC, it was my great\u00d76 uncle who made Washington surrender and sign a paper saying he caused the French and Indian War, so that means, going into the past, I probably have fewer than 6 degrees between me and George Washington. All this, and I&#39;m nobody famous. Most people who meet me have no idea I have these connections.

An error in judgment anywhere in the chain could the prevent the package from coming through to the target even if a successful (but unknown) chain existed. With similar groups of people (stock brokers, doctors, attorneys, etc), errors in judgment play a lesser role because the participants&#39; (i.e. everyone handling the packages) are more likely to send the package along to someone who is capable of maintaining the chain by chance. So we should expect people with a strong common connection (college, military service, occupation, etc.) to have more success.

This is the &#39;random link&#39; that shortens the links between my clusters here in the States and the clusters in the Philippines. What I&#39;ve noticed is that most of us have some pretty short links to some amazing clusters-- the real trick is knowing a bit of history and paying attention. I knew a man who knew Trotsky, Trotsky knew Lenin, Stalin, Molotov. A foreign minister for the USSR Molotov knew Hitler, Mao, etc.... I&#39;ve met President Clinton&#39;s chief of staff Leon Panetta, this would link me in one degree to all of the recent presidents, candidates, and two degrees from the vast numbers of people these people would have met....  So these links are not so much random as easy to be unaware of.  (In the mathematical modeling they&#39;re random, but in real life they&#39;re like most coincidences,  unlikely in specifics, but common in as unspecific. <br> .", "comment_date": "2018-09-26T03:59:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Og Astorga", "comment_text": "Doesn&#39;t facebook know the answer to 6 degrees on first hand?", "comment_date": "2018-09-25T16:49:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Spratt", "comment_text": "you have until september 1 2015 - published august 25 2015", "comment_date": "2018-09-23T03:46:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julien CKJM", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcxZSmzPw8k&amp;t=07m01s\">07:01</a><br>Was watching at 1.5x  and when I reached out to this part, I suddenly slowed down to normal!!\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2018-09-22T17:48:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quantum Puddles", "comment_text": "<b>BLACK BILL NYE!!</b>", "comment_date": "2018-09-21T23:56:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RD Dulos", "comment_text": "Who&#39;s here from the Garage video?", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T01:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seanonymous", "comment_text": "&quot;This video is very interesting&quot; \u2013 <i>Cambridge Analytica</i>", "comment_date": "2018-09-19T22:48:30Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "- likeaviciousdove -", "comment_text": "lel i searched six degrees of separation by the script and this showed up", "comment_date": "2018-09-19T11:52:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yakoto", "comment_text": "So.. whats your name?", "comment_date": "2018-09-16T16:06:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A L", "comment_text": "So I know you\u2019re on YouTube and you know heaps of Incredible people that makes me know all those incredible and smart people too so I\u2019m not just a nobody then I\u2019m just living a 6 degree of Separation just a tiny ocean full of fishes.

I&#39;m thinking it was mid to late 1990&#39;s. Sorry, but I can&#39;t recall specifics. They were both American universities and I think one was Harvard but I won&#39;t swear to it. Participants were instructed to reach a given target they did not know through email using geographic location and other parameters. Anyway, it involved no such social networks as you mentioned, but was truly stranger to stranger, and the average number of people or connections required to reach the targets was between 6 and 7 people. I consider these two studies to be the most accurate and unique in an opportune time of history, because it was easy to forward emails then, spam blockers were nonexistent or very limited, junk mail had not yet gained a grip on email boxes, email was so unique that everybody was getting on board and dumping snail mail, which takes much more effort for anyone, and no formal social networks existed then to skew results .

Facebook example is bad simply because there is a lot of fan pages. Lets say I have connection to U2 fan page which has a lot of members who than also have more celebrity fun pages etc. So in this example those huge celebrity pages give backbone in creation of links - not ppl knowing each other by any means. This leads us to another bad assumption in this video - 44 friends example. That example assumes that all A 44 links know 44 unknown to A links (B1-B44 links), while than every link from array of B, links to another 44 of C links and so on, where all generated links with exception to B dont have connection with A and from all other B, C, D arrays etc. My point is that there are a lot of friends lets say on Facebook who share same friends, but also there are many suggested friends - friends of our friends who are not our friends and so on. So when we speak in therms where people connect on knowing each other, clusters are very small. Someone of those sure has aunt who lives on other part of world and from her cycles someone does two - yes but 6 links to Mongolian farmer? - simply no way. Similar idea was presented by another nice channel Vsauce some time ago where author states that all people on planet are in relation to each other by fewer than 50 links - if that would be true we would not have races. All these theories come from taking one postulate from probability or statistics and building up fact theory on top of it, but both of those can not be taken for granted without an proof.

One year and a half later she came back to the school and I met her, but we were never very close. Anyway I moved away six months later and I moved to Latvia. I went to an international school there and after one year there I joined MUN, where I was put into a specific sub committee. We prepared for a few weeks before going to our conference in the Hague, Netherlands. I was representing\u00a0Argentina and so I struck up a conversation with which ever country was to my\u00a0right, his name was &quot;andy&quot;. He was one of the few people I ended up talking to while I was there.

I guess the chance to get the right people six times in a row is extremely small.
