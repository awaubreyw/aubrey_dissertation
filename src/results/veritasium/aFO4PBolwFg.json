The explanation is smple according Newton: The fluid air tends to travel at a staight line if not acted upon by a perpendicular force. The curved flow of air is like in any other curved motion of a mass: It&#39;s acted upon by centripetal force. The upper wing surface has to supply this centripetal force to make the airflow follow the curve (wing shape).

If A causes B, and B causes A, then we get a chain reaction... We do not get a chain reaction and air WILL accelerate into a lower pressure region, therefore it is impossible for the increase in speed to be the cause of the lower pressure. You are right about the coanda effect being the reason that the air follows the upper surface downward... this needs more explanation.  ALL of the lift (F) is the result of Air with mass (M) being accelerated downward. For a plane up in the sky, there is absolutely nothing to provide a force upward other than by accelerating the mass of air downward...

Bernoulli&#39;s principle never says why the air speeds up, just that it does so with an associated decrease in pressure. In the case of a wing, the air speeds up because it in a sense passes through a restriction created by the camber of the wing, like in a venturi. Visualized two dimensionally, the camber of the wing forms the bottom of the restriction, and the airflow not affected by the wing forms the top.\u00a0This explains why a cambered wing creates lift even at zero angle of attack. In fact, camber has such a profound effect on the performance of a wing, that certain extremely thick and highly cambered wings can offset some of their induced drag by creating a lift vector angled towards the direction of flight.<br><br>I also feel that the video oversimplifies what happens when the angle of attack increases, only addressing the increase in Newtonian lift, the downward deflection of air. Increasing the angle of attack also decreases the size of the theoretical restriction, thus speeding up the airflow over the top of the wing. This explains how a flat wing like the Wright Brothers&#39; was able to fly. Camber is not needed to induce Bernoullian lift when the angle of attack is anything but zero.<br><br>Overall I think that this explanation is pointed in the right direction, but it&#39;s still inadequate to the point that it unfortunately further contributes to an improper understanding of lift. It correctly addresses the misconception that two air-streams separated at the leading edge must meet at the trailing edge, and it introduces little known Newtonian lift, but it really is a vast oversimplification and gross under-explanation of the contributions of Bernoullian lift.
