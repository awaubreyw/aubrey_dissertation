I believe AE imagined freefalling down the shaft (possibly expanding his imagined scenario of the elevator shafter continuing either far in or completely through the earth).

unless somehow you do it completely smoothly it could swing that way but naturally just going forward and then turning left or right it&#39;s going to have a different it&#39;s going to turn into some other thing than a line whether it be I think it would kind of like bow all the way like maybe have a bowl towards the bottom to the middle of the rope for an unknown amount of time very brief or maybe a little longer and brief who knows but then they would turn back into that diagonal line and coordinates to whichever way that helicopter is going if it turns again and turns right and make the same should make the same type of shape-ish thing as if it would it turn left just on the right side it should be that&#39;d be like seeing him as mirrored cuz remember they&#39;re not being affected by the winter they&#39;re not supposed to be anyways very bad acknowledge of it because it is being affected by the wind it&#39;s also being affected by the forces of drag and pull or pull and drag it&#39;s also being affected by a force that we still know very little about but we can see its effects and we can feel its effects sometimes and it&#39;s a force that pushes and that&#39;s called gravity because we live in a four dimensional space-time that is already filled up and then the plans and s*** were popped into it out of molecules and things like that that are already existed in court bosons Hicks on all kinds of things before and he does particle popped into existence to make anything so picture it as if it is a pressurized thing like a fish aquarium full of water and for the sake of the actual look of it it&#39;d be the claim it&#39;s like flat can&#39;t be that flat s*<b>*</b> in it it has to have room for the s*** in it so it&#39;s not flat so it&#39;s a little bit representation I think of it but it that&#39;s why I use the fish aquarium but anyways so you got these rubber balls we&#39;re going to use them as planets and rocks and all kinds of stuff right you put it into the water and wherever you put them at in the water submerged say they stay there so you know cuz they float around in space so today that water level what happens that water level every time you put something in that water it rises does not why because now those planets and the things that are existing materially are taking up space that was already taken up by the water that&#39;s expansion and all that water that&#39;s around those balls that were using for planets are literally doing what pushing on that ball in all directions just like gravity does for any type of mass bigger Mass more gravity more denser Mass more gravity doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be huge it&#39;s just going to have a lot of density of mass . So nowhere what expansion and compression from things popping into existence was putting the balls in the water things like that rocks asteroids Suns gaseous planets rocky planets watery celestial dust you name it it&#39;s all in there take taking up the space it&#39;s already used up well I&#39;ll never keeps rising dispatching keeps happening and at the same time it&#39;s causing from that pressure that the balls are taking up space that is pushing out the water and the water is pushing back on it trying to claim it space back that it can&#39;t because something else is there now and that is grab the force of gravity pushing on everything now take that with a black hole nothing would fall into a black hole nothing gets sucked into a black hole it literally gets pushed into the black hole if it gets too close because the density of mass that singularity point is so dense it causes a power so great that can&#39;t be escaped from after a certain point that nothing escapes from lawsuit for leave it up to the same type of radiation that David banner was exposed to that turned him into the hulk every now and then it&#39;s called Hawkins radiation but that&#39;s cuz Steve Hawkins proved that it did so gamma radiation&#39;s big chunk anyways so instead of thinking that you&#39;re being sucked in or the gravitational force is pulling you in there after that certain point the pressure is so great and flowing through a hole that it&#39;s literally pushing you out as if you&#39;re being a diver that just dive into the pool and for some reason close to the drug plug and that plug just happened to be pulled out and gets sucked into it right nope he would get sucked into it if it was a real pool but in space with the black hole after a certain point where that you can&#39;t escape from the pressure would be pushing that water through that hole which is the black hole because the cosmic universe would be pressurized a pressure on anything on the inside after a certain point even if you stop creating more pressure it keeps expanding and then ends up bursting and then the last black hole would suck up the last of the material in the cosmic universe and the new cosmic cosmos would be created with the same type of pressurization so the guarantee is that SpaceTime would be SpaceTime for dimensions no matter what it created in the cosmic universe to begin with because the water should never change there&#39;s a biblical term right at the beginning in Genesis when the creation story when they describe the first thing they describe it is and his face showed upon the waters and describe him as if it he was his face was floating over the waters and in the Old testament in Genesis in that certain other older books it literally says that he said he did not create the waters the waters already existed when he came thus the Almighty Creator God the Father not only is an entity that does not live in a the natural material around with us but he&#39;s an alien on top of it come from a different place just an ideological terms to bring that part worked into the thought there doesn&#39;t fit the actual narrative but I described the natural way and then I threw the god part in there to see if you&#39;re paying attention but anyways that would mean that the universe said it&#39;s newly created after our ceases to exist doesn&#39;t really cease to exist just the stuff in it has in the material stuff get sucked up gets pushed through the gamma radiation from the black very last black holes would run out and never be replenished because there&#39;s nothing else for it to get its energy from and they would stop and there&#39;d be the cosmos before anything except the quarks and oh you know all that stuff corks the elements fundamental elements you know and poof it start all over again and create new planets a new solar systems and if it turns out that there&#39;s no place and that cosmic SpaceTime that has just like conditions as our planet does there&#39;d be no life as of human life for any mammal life in that cosmic cosmos they just be the planets and stuff floating around but space time and the new space is being taken up that the water had claimed back when everything pop search popping back into existence it would literally cause an expansion of the water and if things a lot of things close are right on to the same time are so close enough that we put in that water that expansion would first really high really fast the Big bang and it would keep expanding until the forces of Newton&#39;s law even of they had Newton&#39;s laws of motion if you&#39;re out in outer space and you throw something it goes until it hits something that he catches it and then it&#39;s on that or it keeps speeding up and speeding up and speeding up and it&#39;ll do so if it&#39;s not obstructed in any way and just stay going and straight line and gaining speed gaining speed and gaining speed until something stops it that&#39;s exactly what a visible cosmic SpaceTime is done and doing it&#39;s literally what they&#39;re describing is it not it&#39;s really hard to describe it pee on words cuz my machine to speak on stupid

It is how much this weight is, what causes the how far up the curve begins along with the speed of the helicopter. Think of it this way, the topmost point is being pulled the most (because it has the entire weight of the system pulling it taut) and hence stays the most taut. The other/bottom-most point of the rope is being pulled the least (since nothing is pulling it from below), it has the most degree of freedom. Hence it gets a chance to sometimes dip towards the ground but also jump up if it gets hit with a sudden gust of wind. In fact we do see the rope wobbling the most at the bottom most point. We also see the same behavior even with the weight attached ! Even with the weight, when the helicopter starts, the rope is straight at the beginning, but as the heli moves forward it pulls the rope closest to it more than the bottom part (because nothing is pullingthe rope at an angle at the bottom-most part) and the initial curve is formed. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-_7y0WUnW4&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a> you can observe that when either the speed of the aircraft increases the tautness of the rope changes and it starts from the top and that wave makes it to the bottom of the rope. My guess is that if a floating balloon is tied to the end of the rope instead of the weight to reverse the effect we would see the same effect inverted i.e. a &quot;J shape&quot;, the curve of which would depend on how much does weight the baloon can carry up.

Since we can assume that for every small rope section the dynamic pressure, drag coefficient, and the associated small amount surface area with said section is the same for the entire rope, the force of drag is therefore constant across the entire rope. This leads to the conclusion that the force of gravity (weight) and/or tension must be the shape-determining forces.<br>Looking at gravity, each small section of rope must have the same exact weight because it is all made of the same material, so the shape-determinant isn\u2019t gravity (in the non-weighted scenario at least). So tension must determine the shape.<br>From here, you can realize that for the rope to be in equilibrium (or not flying away) in respect to an inertial frame of reference moving with the helicopter, the force of tension has to equal the sum of the force of drag and gravity together. Since these two forces are normal to one another, tension must be diagonal to fully equalize each component. Ok, so we now know it\u2019s not just some straight like downwards or somehow diagonally forwards, but does the rope curve at all? Well, as with all tension forces, it acts in both directions. Because it\u2019s a rope and cannot sustain large compressive forces, at the very top of the rope attached to the helicopter, the force of tension pulling up-right is the greatest since the force of the rest of the rope is adding a separate tension down-left. As you gown down the rope, the up-right tension decreases just as the down-left tension also decreases. Since each rope section has the same drag and weight, this decrease in both tensions is linear, thus, you get a straight line. <br><br>The angle at which any section of rope is at depends only upon the ratio of the downwards weight and tension forces to the horizontal drag force. If the order of magnitude of the downwards forces is much greater than the drag, then the angle must be very close to 0 (from the vertical) and if it\u2019s the other way around, 90. For the scenario with the weight, you can tell the basic shape because of the edge case scenarios: the rope near the helicopter acts the same as the non-weighted case and the rope near the weight has downwards forces with an order of magnitude MUCH greater than the drag, so its angle must be near vertical. Because forces distribute smoothly in nature and there\u2019s no other forces and thus another edge case in the middle of the rope, it must make a curve to fit what was shown in option D.", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T07:49:19Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Sunny Islam", "comment_text": "Thank you for bringing it down", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T07:26:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "El Astronaute", "comment_text": "I got this right I chose B, C didn&#39;t make sense in my mind.", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T07:08:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arif Hv437", "comment_text": "So nice experiemen \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T06:56:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Good Gu", "comment_text": "The question didn&#39;t say what the constant speed is,  so the rope can be going straight down as A if constant speed=0.", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T06:29:25Z", "likes_count": 88}, {"comment_by": "Benny Blue", "comment_text": "Meanwhile, in an alternate universe: <br>\u201cYou are flying a helicopter.

You can see in your &quot;linear&quot; video that it is not linear at the tail end of the rope - it drops faster like D. A shorter rope with a weight on it will emulate a long rope. It is <b>never</b> truly linear. Since rope is &quot;dense&quot; (in context) the weight pulls it down more than the resistance pulls it back so the answer is D. The parachute example shows what happens if the weight is low and air-resistance is high; then it becomes C. It will always be a parabola since gravity is always down and the relationship between speed and air-resistance is squared.

This phenomena is when the blades starts flapping (advancing side blade moves up, retreating blade moves down with each rotation) to compensate for different relative velocity around the rotor path plane.  The rotor wash directly beneath the helicopter is then negligible as it is increasingly &quot;left behind&quot;  the aircraft and the rotor increasingly processes fresh (an accelerated) air.  The pilot typically reduces the collective rotor pitch to compensate for this increased performance.  You can see this when a helicopter flies over water in close proximity at various speeds.  This phenomena greatly increases helicopter rotor lift (efficiency at converting engine kw to lift), so the helicopter pilot typically wants to get into the translational lift environment to save fuel and reduce engine power demand as quickly as possible.  The helicopter is also less vulnerable to engine failure in translational flight mode - if the engine failed it is easier to safely auto rotate to the ground with the energy and increased lift of forward flight added to the stored energy of the rotor rotating mass.  Their is something in the manual called the &quot;death curve&quot; typically.  It is graph of height versus airspeed.  On one side, and as you get further from the curve, the helicopter is easy to safely autorotate to the ground.  On the other side, it is unlikely you have sufficient combination of altitude, airspeed and rotor rpm to land safely if the engine catastrophically fails (instantaneous loss of engine power).", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T11:07:29Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "S\u2206CHIN KUM\u2206R", "comment_text": "All the questions and it&#39;s explanation depends upon all the factors which are used as like helicopter and speed etc", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T10:54:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lnvalidM8 ?", "comment_text": "what is the constant speed? how heavy is the rope? what is this rope made of? is it air resistant?", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T10:47:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Koto-Sama", "comment_text": "for E to be correct you needed a parachute at the center of the rope and a weight at the end?", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T10:16:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Douche", "comment_text": "ok i have not wached the vid yet but I think the answer is b", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T10:15:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vaque", "comment_text": "right, all is interesting.

(it does at least have a stable core to play with). even if i am wrong i would like to know why. the thought is that we already see how the moon affects our our oceans tides. however since the moon is so close to earth that it&#39;s core should also be affected by events on earth, all day, every day, forever, and studying the moon&#39;s core could actually provide us with some clues about memory storage in space travel and how gravity works, and how to replicate objects at long distances, which is basically warp drive or teleportation utilizing quantum states of information. just a thought.", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T23:14:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "STRAWMAN", "comment_text": "Its not a riddle", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T23:03:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pin Head", "comment_text": "Anything put at the end of the rope like a weight then you have drag which would make the rope bend but the faster you go the rope will straighten and lift in a straight line", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T23:00:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Al Steiner", "comment_text": "I picked D because of time spent in the Marine Corps", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T22:51:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-_7y0WUnW4&amp;t=9m42s\">9:42</a> &quot;would be destruction to the aircraft...&quot;<br>That&#39;s probably what stopped Galileo from dropping weights off of a helicopter.", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T22:47:00Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "James Ru", "comment_text": "No you cheated the results.

As for these details, many users will trust on Veritasium prof and the professor knowledge, but I am not saying they are wrong, but I am determining that the consideration of the test for those questions, are in a way that leads to those results. A cable will not change that much the results, neither off axis. But there are other factors that will do in fact affect to a question that is quite peculiar with barely any details. For example the way the aircraft propels itself or the starting speed of the aircraft compared to the constant speed, those will be details that will change the results of the answer.<br>To put it in other words, we don&#39;t have a clear question of the details of the object or time that are implied, and it&#39;s a representation of the user to consider what is the rest, in which we open more variables and more users will be drawn to consider situations that are correct solved, but meant different by the professor who is testing them. Any pilot from any army, and including this pilot, will clearly mention that you shouldn&#39;t pull any string/cable/rope with enough strength from a stop because it will whip backwards to the rear propeller. And for a last consideration every option is quite correct, &#39;A&#39; could be made possible cause of the slow speed or the heavy weight of the cable, but is time considered, since will most likely turn to &#39;B&#39; at some point, &#39;C&#39; and &#39;D&#39; are exactly as Veritasium explained and showed, it will be harder/easier to see with a cable, but it will still happen in those situations, and &#39;E&#39; is self-explanatory when the aircraft will start from a stop, quickly turning into a &#39;C&#39; then into a &#39;D&#39; and then ending &#39;B&#39;.<br><br>Again he did not explain it bad, its just lacking some video prof of the correct interpretation of the people, the question was lacking many details and opened many physics questions, &#39;B&#39; is the answer for that specific poor question, and if we add more variables into consideration, many users/students will be right with the rest of answers.<br>If you plan to blatantly just deny my words or curse them or insult me, it&#39;s fine.

If you were cut the rope at a point and put a person at that point holding the cut ends in each hand they would have to produce the 2 tension forces at that point.  So while your empirical evidence seems quite clear cut, your explanation is missing this other force and so is not complete.

Why isn&#39;t scale regarded as a spacial dimention ? Nowadays scales are pretty much part of our daily studies, from studying atoms to supermassive blackholes. For example if I would ask for the coordinates of an atom sitting in your display you would give me x, y, z but I would still need scale, otherwise these coordinates could indicate the atom, your display, planet earth, etc. Also, if I&#39;m visualizing this right, gravity appears to be space-time moving in this spacial axis, from the macro towards the micro ? So why isn&#39;t scale the fourth spatial dimention and time the fifth ? Can you gather information to explain why it might be or why it isn&#39;t ? Would love to see a video on this.

I would like to bring some more aerodynamics into the picture. Heres my theory: The downwash creates a curtain of downward airflow which is zero velocity at the center of the rotor, and peak velocity at the edges of the rotor. When the helicopter now moves forward at the constant velocity, this downwash from the rotors combined with the airspeed, makes the resultant &quot;curtain&quot; go a fixed angle backwards? and the hence causes a linear application of drag along the rope. Theres also the airflow around and under the nose of the aircraft which should cause non-linear drag at the top of the rope (which probably doesnt happen if you account for the downdraft from the rotors.) If you notice the bottom end of the rope, its wagging in air and never stable since its likekly outside this curtain of downdraft and in turbulent airflow. <br><br>Id be interested in seeing a CFD model including the chopper, and its rotors producing downwash, and including the outwash effects from the nose of the helicopter, and how they interact with the downwash.

From experience having artillery pieces sling loaded and moved in the army, I would say that the presumption that the rotor wash does not extend is dependent on the weight and size of the aircraft. Having to carry and artillery piece amount of weight requires ALOT of downward thrust. Additionally, the shape of the aircraft effects how protected the rope is from that downward thrust.

Why is it B, with my limited understanding of physics and my fairly decent understanding of aeronautics? The force acting upon the rope as it moves is mostly uniform across the surface of the rope, there is the downward force of the rotor wash and the forward (in this case diagonal) force of the helicopter, which uniformly pushes the rope backwards along its length. Of course the latter is called air resistance, or more simply, drag. Depending on the length and speed of the rotor blades, the distance at which rotor wash would dissipate varies. The rope being 50 feet long, the end of the rope is no longer affected by the rotor wash in any significant way. Assuming the weight of the rope is uniform across the length, the amount of drag has to be uniform across it&#39;s surface. This causes the rope to drag behind the helicopter in a straight diagonal line, versus having any sort of curve.

I answered the survey before C, but now Im thinking that its B. I tried to think through a model of segments of the cable.

As you move up the cable, each segment has the same drag and weight plus the drag and weight of each other segment. All segments being uniform, these summed forces will have the same net direction.<br><br>Edit: at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-_7y0WUnW4&amp;t=6m24s\">6:24</a> so I&#39;ll disregard drag on the kettle bell for a second and go through the same process. The end segment now has the weight of the kettle bell plus the weight of itself and its drag. This direction is more downward than a free hanging rope segment. So the tension will need to be more upward. As you move up the rope, you are adding additional force vectors with slightly less downward component proportionally. I predict the rope will take the shape of D.<br><br>Edit after watching: so my original flaw when I answered the survey was... well I was lazy... but also I considered the infinitesimal end of the rope to have drag and no weight.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours.

However I don&#39;t think your explanation is very good. My attempt: There are actually four forces acting on each segment of the rope: drag and weight, which are constant for each segment, as well as two tensions: tension pulling the segment up coming from the segment above, and tension pulling down from below coming from the weight of the rope. This DIFFERENCE in tensions is the force that is being balanced by weight and drag. The difference in tensions turns out to be constant along the length of the rope. Think about the zero-wind case -&gt; there is a constant force pulling down on each segment of the rope. The tension pulling the rope up is equal to the weight of the rope below the top of the segment, and the tension pulling it down is equal to the weight of the rope below the bottom of the segment (which is shorter, and thus less). So the net tension on the segment is exactly equal, but opposite to the weight of the segment, because this is the difference in weights. The case with a constant air velocity is equivalent (drag plus gravity are always the same magnitude, and directed in the same direction, just like gravity in the case of no wind), so we get the same solution - a straight line - just rotated by the angle of the vector which is the sum of the gravity and drag vectors.<br><br>To me and others who I watched the video with, it looks as if you are talking only about tension pulling up - I think it would help if you explicitly broke out the tension into the pair of forces, and showed that it was constant along the length of the rope, and that the zero wind case is equivalent to the constant air velocity case - a little diagram similar to the ones you already had would be all that&#39;s needed.", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T15:36:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Red_Orange", "comment_text": "B was my answer within 5s of looking at the questions, just general knowledge.", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T15:35:14Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin", "comment_text": "The question posed states constant speed, yet in the video it is increasing in speed.

If the rotor was spinning faster, or if the blades were larger, or whatever would be needed to keep a heavier helicopter moving laterally, would the wash be stronger and extend farther below the helicopter? Please inform me if this is not the case, and if there&#39;s something I&#39;m unaware of that would dictate that the wash would either not be stronger, or that a stronger wash would somehow dissipate quicker, and not extend farther below the helicopter. Because if this does work how I imagine, I don&#39;t believe the weight of the helicopter is specified, and therefore I don&#39;t believe the intensity of the wash is specified, and if that&#39;s the case, wouldn&#39;t it be unclear whether or not the wash would be affecting the shape of the rope?

The video you took was viewing from the front of the aircraft travel which I feel was distorting the result of the rope, it would have taken the E shape if it was long enough, for the following reasons. A the length of the rope eventually over comes the air resistance, B the moving parcel of air is affecting the angle of the rope causing it to lean back further than if the air was still i.e. if the air is moving you need to factor this into the equation. You mentioned that it &quot;makes a diagonal straight line&quot; however the rope will eventually become heavy enough to create the S curve of E. But given the air moving towards the aircraft it would provide a straight line as seen in your video. Just my two cents.

The pilot says this at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-_7y0WUnW4&amp;t=1m12s\">1:12</a> and we see it at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-_7y0WUnW4&amp;t=1m58s\">1:58</a>. As forward speed increases the helicopter leaves its rotor wash behind, and so the cable moves through unaffected air. There is also the weight of the perfectly flexible cable.

Here&#39;s my engineering background take on this. Each unit length of rope (millimetre, inch, foot, yard, metre or whatever) has a drag force on it due to the horizontal movement through the atmosphere. It also has a force due to gravity acting on its mass. The resultant vector force on each of these unit lengths will be the same so the rope should hang in a straight line with the angle being determined by the drag force and gravitational force. The only issue is how long the transition from stationary to horizontal movement at a steady state takes for everything to settle down and does the downwash from the rotor disk have an effect. Well the rotor wash will have a limited range and the dampening effect of the rope moving in a viscous fluid (air) will quickly result in a steady state.<br><br>I have now watched the video and it matches what I thought.

The way you have it dangling out of the cabin leaves the top free to rotate, so it can be pulled straight in the overall direction of tension, instead of displaying a curve transitioning from a fixed end to the free flying end. Given the safety concerns in this experiment, I can see why you went with this approach, however if other people thought like I did, then I think it clearly misrepresents what is being asked. I am open to being wrong of course, but I would really like to see a vertically fixed attachment point (vertical relative to the ground when travelling) to be thoroughly convinced. I expect to see a curve that is some function of air resistance, gravity, and the stiffness of the rope. A rope with zero stiffness would be no different to the results in your experiment of course, but as the stiffness increases, you would surely see a curve approaching the majoritively picked answer. I mean, don&#39;t rent a whole-ass helicopter again on my account, but I do wonder if other people are as unsatisfied with this test as I am. No disrespect of course, your videos are always interesting and entertaining. And the shape with the weighted end was actually surprising to me. omg you know what, I bet if you ran this experiment with the top fixed as I described above, AND a weight on the free end, You would get something like the S curve, again dependant on the stiffness of the rope. I guess the best way to describe my reasoning: If you did this with a pole of 100% stiffness, there would be no question, we could all agree it would point straight down (if it was a fixed attachment point and not free to rotate, as mentioned). Similarley, a rope of 0% stiffness would have an infinitely small bend radius and so any amount of evenly applied force would cause it to be angled from the attachment point but otherwise perfectly straight. Of course reality is nowhere near these ideals, but clearly there is some in-betweens that we CAN test, in order to better describe this problem. As for a practical way to test this, if you WERE to approach it again, my suggestion would be a tube that the rope can be passed through but it is a tight fit (or can be tightened), and that this tube has some kind of mounting bracket that give a consistent fixed angle of dangle, maybe it would even be worth this being a variable angle so you could test with the rope exiting the tube horizontally forwards and back. And also different stiffnesses of rope to test (same density and cross-sectional surface area preferably, I have no idea how realistic that would be to find though)<br><br>edit: just to be clear, when I said not convinced by, I meant not satisfied with. Clearly, the result is true for this test case, only the statement of the problem I feel was ambiguous such that it has not been thoroughly answered. I answered C like most people, based on the assumption that the rope was fixed. I thought it would be because all of the rope would have the same amount of wind resistance, but the lower down the rope you go, the less mass from the rope above it is a factor, so it would be more affected by the wind relative to it&#39;s cross-sectional area to the direction of travel (but also each section&#39;s area of resistance would be changed since the angle from one section would be inherited by the one below it).

Since air density is exponentially higher in the -z-direction, and each segment of rope is being pulled in the +x-direction with nearly the same velocity, it would imply that the force in the -x-direction would become exponentially higher as the rope reached the ground, giving it the same shape we saw in &quot;C&quot;. As a sanity check, we should take this idea to its limits. A segment of rope moving in the +x-direction in exoatmosphere would have virtually no force in the -x-direction to due low air density, and would hang vertically downwards.

Based on the video, the helicopter wasn&#39;t traveling at a typical speed (90-120 knots more if tandem rotors) in forward operation. It was almost at a hover (come on, 60 knots is slow). The pilot brought up an interesting question about the rope coming into the tailrotor or into the main rotor. Neither would happen due to the weight of the rope (fast rope operation). If the rope weighed very little, it may wrap around the aircraft but we don&#39;t use little ropes, we use big fat ropes that can handle the weight of several combat equipped troops (fast rope). For sling load operations, the slingloads may oscillate during single hook operations (fore and aft). In this case the pilot just reduces speed to stop the oscillation. If the pilot in this test had reached typical operational speed (90 -120 knots), the rope would have looked like answer C, D, E, and pretty much all the answers. This is based on 17 years of flying single rotor and tandem rotor helicopters. In a tandem rotor system, we don&#39;t have a tail rotor to slow us down so our VNE (Velocity Never to Exceed) is well over 170 knots (or the official answer is &quot;we don&#39;t have a VNE&quot;). The CH-47 helicopter wants to go fast due to the tilt of the rotor system (9 degree front, 4 degrees aft) and the design of the platform (nose low). If this test were repeated at normal operating speeds, the rope would not be diagonal as shown in the video. What you had was a pilot who was being very cautious, not a tactical pilot. One of the reasons for the answer C being correct is due to forward velocity, plus the downward draft of the rotor system. The part of the rope that is closest to the helicopter (top of the rope) will move at the speed of the aircraft because it has no choice (attached to helicopter). The tail of the rope (bottom) will be aft of the top just like a flag in the wind (all over the place). Helicopters have a downward rotorwash that impacts (kinda cushions) upward lift (Effective Transnational Lift (ELT)). Yeah, I&#39;m not supposed to say &quot;cushion&quot; because it&#39;s not a aerodynamic term but it fits this answer. Which leads us to the big point that wasn&#39;t taken into consideration: rotarywing aerodynamics in forward flight. The rope &quot;hang&quot; will change based on the speed of the helicopter (forward velocity), the speed (and size) of the overhead rotor system (downward draft), as well as the weight of the rope.

It goes like this:<br>On the inverse square law for radiation\r<br>We know that radio signal strength decreases with distance according to an inverse square law so that if you double your distance from the source (a radio transmitter) the received field strength is decreased by four.  This comes from the fact that you can consider the wave front as the surface of an expanding sphere and the surface area of a sphere (field strength) is proportional to the square of the radius (distance from the radio transmitter).  This is true whether the transmitter&#39;s antenna is omni-directional (equal energy in all directions) or focused in one direction.  If it&#39;s spreading AT ALL the energy will decrease according to the inverse square law.\r<br>\r<br>Now consider a perfect laser where the energy is confined to a single narrow beam that doesn&#39;t diverge at all.  In that case wouldn&#39;t the energy arriving at the far end be the same as it was when it left?  It&#39;s not spreading out.  If so here&#39;s the crunch.  If the signal spreads to ANY degree it will follow the inverse square law but if it doesn&#39;t, it won&#39;t.  So at what point as we approach &quot;zero spread&quot; does the inverse square law fail?\r<br><br>This sounds like a Calculus question to me but I still find it confusing.", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T01:47:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarcasm", "comment_text": "Seems I overestimated the helicopter downwash, as I actually went with E, thinking they might contribute to some downward momentum at the top of the rope..

The increase in leverage with longer lengths is the same for both a torque applied by gravity and by air resistance, and the angle away from vertical for gravity and from horizontal for air resistance follows the same sinusoidal function. Because the forces scale in the same proportion to length, and because it is is perfectly flexible, it must be a straight line. It must be swept back to be in equilibrium because at dead vertical, gravity applies no torque, but wind force applies a positive torque.

I wonder if there is a bit more to this story...your explanation statement that says &quot;the ratio of air resistance to weight is the same at every point along the rope&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-_7y0WUnW4&amp;t=5m40s\">5:40</a>) is perhaps contestible. I would propose the air drag/resistance, Fa, is constant along the length of the rope, but the weight, Fg, varies linearly along the length of the rope due to the concatenating tension phenomena as you explained. A constant summed with a quantity that varies linearly along a spatial dimension still results in a linear output function (straight rope), but the statement that the ratio between the two forces is equal along that spatial dimension is probably incorrect. In fact I would take it a step further and argue that the implied general statement that the ratio between these two forces needing to remain equal is required for output linearity is probably not necessary--even if the air resistance varied along the length of the rope, as long as it did so linearly, would still result in a linear output function (rope in a straight line) since a linear function summed with another linear function still results in a linear output, even if the slope of those two summed functions were not the same (which would also result in a ratio between these two forces that vary along the length of the rope). Happy to entertain dissenting opinions on this though :).\r<br>\r<br>The introduced weight (and parachute) clearly introduce a nonlinear lumped parameter on the legnth of the rope, which explains the nonlinear output function. I&#39;ll eat my pride and admit this was not my initual intuition when you added the weight, but hey, nonlinear systems are non-intuitive :). You did an awesome job contextualizing this effect with the added mass and the parachute--honestly a lot of really great stuff here, but done in a very accessible way. Thank you also for not making me watch 10 minutes into the video for the correct answer (you&#39;re sticking to your long term promise of tantalizing video titles with informative content).", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T23:11:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lbb2r", "comment_text": "I still think the creation of the little text helicopter poll was the most genius part of this whole thing.", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T23:10:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maranatha-Lord-Jesus", "comment_text": "&quot;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&quot; Romans 10:9\r<br>Jesus Christ died on the cross for all of our sins, so that we may be forgiven and receive Eternal Life.\r<br>Jesus Christ is the only path to salvation, he lived a sinless life and went to Hell in our place so that we can be reconciled to God.\r<br>Please my Friends, Repent and Believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior now.\r<br>God Bless you all!", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T23:10:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J M", "comment_text": "NAILED IT!", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T23:10:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "servantking", "comment_text": "Yay, I was right!", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T23:10:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WhiteSammySosa", "comment_text": "The pilot hated every second of this.", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T23:10:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PalladianPD", "comment_text": "Before watching the result:<br>C; the drag force on each element of the rope is for the moment assumed to be equal.

Thanks so much for sharing this riddle and the experimental check. I agree with your explanation, though I&#39;d like to point one missing detail from it. You use the fact that the air friction is constant along the rope, but that&#39;s only true for a straight rope. Otherwise, the friction should change with the slope - it should be maximal for a vertical piece and minimal for a horizontal piece. So the configuration from B is a solution to the equation of motion, but you still need to show that there is no other configuration (achievable from other initial conditions).

As you climb higher, the increase in weight compared to the negligible increase in resistance points the tension upward, thereby increasing drag as you climb higher until their rate of increase for weight and resistance equalizes.

First because of responsibility. Most of accidents are created by people not respecting the law. If you remove those people from your sample, the safety a human driver has is incredibly high, and he can drive anywhere without needing to train for months, therefore, in same situations, a human driver is safer than a car.

A human driver can understand the law, which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case for the time being for autonomous cars, especially the Tesla ones.

Since I couldn&#39;t find a reason for why the air resistance would be different at any part of the rope, it seemed like whichever force acting on it would be constant, so I chose B. For D again, I chose intuitively. If there&#39;s a weight on the thing then it must do something to the rope; it can&#39;t just be ignored, that wouldn&#39;t make sense, as gravity still exists. So it was between B and D. Intuitively I thought the rope would have to act similarly to a sail - since it&#39;s attached on the top end, and the weight makes it pseudo-attached on the bottom end, it&#39;s like a flag or a sail that is fixed at the top and where you&#39;re holding the bottom. The wind would blow evenly from the front, but the rope wouldn&#39;t like to bend so much the closer it is to the fix points and so the middle would be bending the most while the outer parts would become more stiff.

It says that it&#39;s not impossible to get that answer.<br>Let&#39;s say I spin around holding a rope. If I spin around slow enough, the shape I will get seen from the top will look like a vortex. If I spin fast enough the rope will fully extend producing a (nearly) straight line. Which one would be the answer to that question then?<br><br>The way this question is stated is problematic in many ways and depending how you interpret it may have multiple answers.<br>First - the way the helicopter is drawn is problematic, cause it may suggest a very small (yet constant - as the question stated) speed. That would produce the answer A to be the closest and you would find a neat equation to explain why that is (one where the gravity and the force downward produced by the roters are so strong that they force the rope staight down). <br>At certain speed and other parameters (leaving asside how those constant angle/speed adjustments by the pilot were creating the environment close to the one in the question) you were able to produce the answer B and found an explanation why that is. But that already resulted in two answers being correct. I don&#39;t have a helicopter nor the budget to rent one so I can&#39;t create and test more scenarios to see if at certain conditions the answer would change. The experience of the pilot may give us a hint though since he was worried that the end of the rope could bounce back to the helicopter&#39;s roters - so maybe C or even E are possible if the parameters - like the speed of the helicopter compared to the power downwards and air resistance were big enough. <br><br>Seems like the pilot did pay attention and made constant adjustments and decisions for a reason. If the answer would be a clear B, that wouldn&#39;t be a problem until you&#39;d reach the level of the line being close to horizontal.<br>That&#39;s the problem of the question and in part of this video giving up too quickly - you found an answer, made sure that it fit the criteria of the question and was sound and ended at it. Worked backwards from one answer. You can prove a lot of things like that which aren&#39;t always true in a broader picture.

So my idea was that i&#39;ve noticed that the middle and the end of the string away from my hand would always move around because it has an thin string and the amount of air hitting the kite would make it lift off. I applied the same situation here but with a twist because i already knew when he said rope, It has to be soo thick that regular person can&#39;t normal use it. So it was obvious to me that the rope should be made out of nylons and stuff like that. The tension in nylon is great and can bend too, If we apply the same kite concept here, We use the help of kite to make the thin string move around in straight line than bending, except since there is already good air resistance and they say it&#39;s a rope so there has got to be a very good amount of surface area covering up in the air with the respect of the length shown in the diagram, when you are flying in a helicopter, It would totally make sense to be in the straight line as the rope is following the path of the helicopter resulting more air resistance hitting on  it in the other direction from it&#39;s path, It would need to hit it equally and the by the law of physics, Each molecules/object etc would have the same amount of gravitational forces pulling towards the earth, Further away from earth results lesser gravitational pull but helicopters just fly few thousand feet above the ground so it wouldn&#39;t matter much and if you keep adding up the vectors of air resistance vs the gravitational pull, It would obviously show a diagonal line. But since helicopters can&#39;t be flying at the same constant speed or atleast in this case because he is checking at the rope while driving so I&#39;m sure maintaining the same proper speed is impossible and in this case they show different results in the movement at the bottom of the rope. Maybe i might sound bit too nerdy but i just assumed the rope to be something like strong nylon as it made sense to follow one of the diagrams given by.", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T15:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Molano", "comment_text": "I thought it was the Steve Mould dispute :(", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T15:00:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Palmer", "comment_text": "only half way through but ...

There is gravity dragging it downwards, and also the wind blowing it to the right. Together, these two forces combined should be pointing downwards and to the left. <br><br>There is also tension dragging it right and up and tension dragging it left and down. Since the rope is flexible, the magnitude of the two tension must be identical. However, because the rope may not be straight, the combined tension should point inwards perpendicular to the tangent line of the arch. <br><br>Since every bit of the rope is moving at a constant speed, the total force acting on this segment must be zero.
