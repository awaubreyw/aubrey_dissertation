[{"comment_by": "Veritasium", "comment_text": "FAQ:<br>1. This is similar to the Magnus effect in that the relative motion of a spinning ball through fluid creates a force that affects its motion. It&#39;s different in that here the fluid starts the ball spinning and there is an equilibrium point around which there are restoring forces. In the Magnus effect the ball must be spinning to begin with and since the fluid is everywhere it can continually change speed and direction.<br>2. It&#39;s not the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect relies on entraining fluid from the surrounding area creating a region of low pressure. Here there is no water surrounding the stream to entrain (since it is a narrow stream).<br>3. Adhesion between the water and the ball is important - this is what directs the water flow over the ball.<br>4. The sum of the forces I show should not be zero but equal and opposite to the weight of the ball. Hence the forces of up and out from the initial contact with the stream and up and in from the spray add to make an upward force equal to weight (the in part of the second force is much more important than the up part)<br>5. It would be interesting to try this with a hydrophobic coating and see if it still works. My hypothesis is it would be much harder.<br>6. Apparently there are other fountains and toys that use this principle that I was unaware of.

I&#39;m a bit late to the party, but I only just saw this video. Your explanation makes sense (conservation of momentum as the water leaves the ball) but I&#39;m not so sure that the Coanda effect doesn&#39;t play a part... I think it&#39;s possible that the levitation happens because you have flow over the surface of the ball, which entrains surrounding air, generating a low pressure region where the water stays attached to the ball. Some water separates as it travels with the ball. The separation of water disrupts the entrainment of the surrounding air so the local pressure reduces compared to the start. When you integrate the pressure over the whole surface, you end up with a net force up and towards the stream. Similarly, you can take a piece of paper, hold it vertically and move it towards a running tap. As soon as it touches the water, the paper bends more towards the water. When the tap is running without the paper, air is still entrained but from all sides so the water runs straight down as it&#39;s in equilibrium. When the paper is placed with one side towards the stream and touching the stream, the dry side has no entrained air by the stream, only the wet side resulting in a low pressure and a net horizontal force further towards the stream. Try this out :) (maybe with a laminated paper, cause the paper gets soaked very quickly otherwise and stops working).", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T09:53:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lawrenzo Green", "comment_text": "I wonder what it would look like if you added frame lights like in magic shows.", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T20:22:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lawrenzo Green", "comment_text": "Mordecai and Rigby: \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2d", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T20:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "charles quesnel", "comment_text": "Put Teflon on the ball and try it", "comment_date": "2021-11-18T13:46:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Morris", "comment_text": "Inpirational", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T20:09:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mansoor Ansari", "comment_text": "I am going forward at the speed of light then What do I see when I look back?<br><br>And if I am going forward at half of the speed of light the do I see 1sec light blinking longer than 1sec(2sec)?<br><br>In theories I have read that NOTHING CAN GO FASTER THAN LIGHT?!", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T15:39:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "green", "comment_text": "I think it has a little to do with centrifugal force and the coanda effect.

Like I felt if I didn&#39;t hold it perfectly flat when placing it on the water stream, it should topple off sideways before it had a chance to balance - but actually you could be quite casual and it would still take.

It&#39;s possible that water on the surface of the ball creates drag as it spins around but that wouldn&#39;t be enough to offset the pressure from the upward stream.  I suspect that the weight of the water relative to the weight of the styrofoam is key to why this works.  It&#39;s likely the center of gravity of the sphere is changing with one side being impregnated with water and the other where the water is separating from the surface.

Which concludes to equality of the forces and which will definitely vary dependant on the force of the stream of water, the air resistance that affects the waters stream, the output of the hose spurting the water, air resistance on the ball (which is making the ball bob around so fluently because the air resistance is another factoring force that is being applied to make the equilibrium of counter-acting forces vary one-sided but due to the wind not being strong enough at that time is why it wasn\u2019t altering the forces enough to knock it off), gravity\u2019s acceleration due to the ball and finally because the ball when spinning obviously and visually brings some water sort of sticking to the ball (due to high enough speeds and friction etc etc.), that obviously pulls the bill down the tiniest bit altering the forces as well as the direction it wants to go (the stream of water (up)) because that\u2019s due to inertia. All these things and many more (I have wrote enough :p) can all alter the balls effect on the steady stream of water and if there\u2019s a slight displacement in a higher force equal or more than a counter-acting force, (like high winds something like that (ads the horizontal force being effected by)) then the ball will drop due to the help of gravity\u2019s acceleration towards fo the ground :) <br><br>Therefore the ball stays levitated by the stream!

For that to be the case there would need to be a much larger fraction of the original stream being redirected by the balls rotation. I believe that Bernoulli&#39;s principle is the main factor. As the stream contacts the ball, the stream is squashed/flattened which causes the stream to increase speed therefore lowering pressure, creating a pulling force. Laminar flow around the whole ball is not required, this is demonstrated by the simple ping pong ball on a string experiment, when the ball contacts a stream of water from a tap, the ball will be attracted to the flow immediately on contact before it gets encased in water. And if your stream is small enough you will reach an equilibrium point where the is barely any contact between the ball and water but the ball remains stuck against the flow.<br><br> I watched through the slow motion footage of you cutting the stream with your hand and if you watch carefully you should notice that just as the stream re-contacts the ball, before any of the water flies over and down, the ball gets &#39;pulled&#39; in towards the stream.

This is mainly because of &#39;Coanda effect&#39;.<br><br>From Wikipedia,<br><br>The tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops.<br>Here, the water is trying to entrain fluid from surroundings. When it comes near to a surface, it cannot pull air from surroundings which makes a low-pressure region between surface and jet. This is because, &#39;when something is emptied from its place, then something should fill the void to keep the balance.&#39;<br><br>Firstly, the ball starts to rotate because of the friction between water and ball surface which is just like a Tesla turbine. As the ball is being hit by the water on one side (not centre), it will push the ball to the other side because it comes in the way of the water. Once the ball starts rotating, the fluid following the surface don&#39;t adhere to the surface much longer and drift apart tangentially.<br><br>This is where the &#39;Magnus effect&#39; kicks in. The magnus effect creates a force perpendicular to the jet direction. This force pushes back the ball to remain in contact with the jet on one side.

Basically, when a fluid flows over a convex surface, it has a tendency to stick to the surface and suck the surface towards the stream. This also applies to plane wings (because air is considered a fluid in physics) when the plane wing moves forward. The air attaches itself to the wing sucking the wing upward.  If you don&#39;t quite get it then just search up Coander effect with spoon and any video will do. It&#39;s quite interesting to see what happens.<br><br>Thanks for your time and the video!

The necessary condition is the high surface area with respect to the mass,  It should work with anything circular in cross section.  The zone of stability is between 45 and 135 degrees. Those points reflect the maximum horizontal forces inside the system If no perturbing forces push the center of gravity from between those two points it will stay there as long as your water holds out.  Gravity provides the restoring force.  The forces are radial across the top and the spray is momentum.  The radial forces across the top sum to a vector equal and opposing the resultant vector of the stream, after removing the couple which rotates the ball.  The ball bobbing in the videos is a.response to variations in the stream and the wind load.  The restoring force at work. The heavy lifting in the phenomena is done by symmetry.  A sphere is placed in the right position to achieve this effect because it is symmetric about all three axis.  It can&#39;t be inserted incorrectly  A disc has to be placed at the center line.  Place it off center and there are no restoring forces and the disc will wobble and fall off. The water uses the ball to create a mass pump.  You provide the energy to kick off the process by placing the ball.  This doesn&#39;t scale well obviously.  And you can&#39;t approach the stable point from the center, the flow will accelerate the ball from the stream.

Therefore, due to the steam not hitting the ball right in the middle there is a torque created which is compensated by the torque of the water sprayed in a spiral. The surface of the ball is moving slightly slower than the stream of water so the water is slowed down which causes the torque on the ball. If the ball moves away from the stream the ball accelerates which breaks the balance of the horizontal momentum of the water and the water accelerated by the top of the ball loses less speed so it ejects earlier and less water is thrown from the bottom of the ball and at the same time the water reflected from the ball is reflected at a smaller angle so the two effects added together cause this unbalanced momentum and push the ball towards the stream. When the ball moves too close to the stream both of these effects are reversed which causes the ball to move away from the stream. Most of the upwards force on the ball is caused by the impact of the stream and the rest is from the water turning to the side and over by the attraction of the ball. There is almost no water accelerated upwards by the ball so there is no significant downwards force caused by this so the other effects are balanced by the gravitational pull of the ball by the planet.", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T10:34:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amit Sengupta", "comment_text": "60fps!", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T10:33:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Espen Johansen", "comment_text": "Does the walls have to be flat, or could you do this with a golf ball?", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T10:32:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abe Coulter", "comment_text": "can you explain about earthquakes.  about slip strike and mega thrust and so on", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T10:30:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jash440", "comment_text": "Do a giant circle", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T10:24:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "akaMyThought", "comment_text": "static electric levitation  is better, it will be how we will fly crafts in the future by changing the positive or negative electrons around the craft to move and levitate, just an FYI on the future I have seen.", "comment_date": "2017-06-27T10:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "willyouwright", "comment_text": "As the water bounces of the ball it has some stickyness and it pulls the ball in that direction. if you used a fluid that was not so sticky it would just push the ball away..

Water hits the ball, starts to push it up, causing the water to cling to the Styrofoam surface, spinning it away from the water source. The rotation of the ball starts to give it  stability and so the water clinging to the surface does indeed get thrown off the other side causing it to not stray from the water source, so does the surface tension and ration though. Anytime the ball gets close and hits more of the stream the rotation is slowed down thus just getting pushed by the water it moves outward. Anytime the ball strays too far its rotation speeds up throwing more water and basically wanting to climb the water like a treadmill.

That is what you thought. That isn&#39;t the case.<br><br>I am pretty sure what is going on has to do with water bonding with the ball and the suction effect it creates upon bonding. You know this bonding from the popping noise when a ball sits in your pool and you yank it out, for example.<br><br>So what is actually happening is, the water shoots by and some of the water creates a contact point where the water and the ball are now bound. Much like a vacuum.<br>The water,  still having momentum, tries to carry the ball up with it. But the ball is too heavy and the bond isn&#39;t strong enough so the bond breaks and so ends the vacuum. That leaves the ball behind. Some of the water shoots up and some of the water rolls with the ball. The ball would fall at this point but because more water is hitting the ball, the process restarts.<br><br>In conclusion, there is no other force beyond water pushing into the ball and then water pulling on the ball as it tries to carry it with it.

Two, when the larger ball was rotating around the stream it still likely kept its angular momentum in the direction it was first rotating at least for some time in which case the water would not have been redirected back towards the stream but rather to the side which would provide no force pushing the ball back towards the stream.

Under small flow rates it moves to a non central equilibrium position (often exhibits non-SHM oscillation) like in this video. However the concept of the ball flinging the fluid away from the stream, thus moving back, does not work; the ball cannot fling water under itself... from what my group could come up in a week was that the main restoring force is due to pressure differences between the movi fluid on one side of the ball, and the absence of a moving fluid on the other side.

You were on the right track when you explained the ping pong ball and hair dryer. If you notice the larger ball in the water stream is not throwing very much of the water over the top and down, most of the water is actually being thrown upward. In fact, in slow motion upon releasing the ball from your hand the ball begins to lift, even before any water at all has been thrown downward, before the rotation has been established.The rotation does give it a gryoscopic stability. But the two forces that hold it up are the impingement of the water stream, that is the mass of water giving it an upward reaction, and this also keeps the ball from moving too far into the stream. The water is also moving fast and gives it a low pressure, causing it to cling to the stream. So it&#39;s a high pressure underneath the ball combined with a low pressure on the side of the ball that keeps it stable. Gryoscopic effect eventually adds some stability. I don&#39;t see enough mass of water moving downward to provide the thrust needed to levitate it, it&#39;s not even enough to counter the larger mass being thrown upward, and certainly no upward thrust at all  before the ball is spinning up to speed.", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T19:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "6eff", "comment_text": "dislikes belong to those whose ball didn&#39;t levitate", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T19:33:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Wang", "comment_text": "WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T19:32:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Kavanagh", "comment_text": "What would it take to make this kind of system push something to space?

In actual fact a large force comes from the coanda effect, which is the suction caused by the boundary layer on the surface in the flow. If you dangle a spoon from a string and bring the curve under a stream of water under a tap you can see this effect yourself, noting how its not the pressure differential of the two sides of the spoon causing the spoons displacement. This demonstration of the ball in water is much the same. Its the suction of the boundary layer caused by the coanda effect, not the countering momentum of the water droplets, which itself would be minimal.

Care to discuss?<br>My first thought was along the lines of water surface tension between the upward stream and the layer of water on the ball that would act to tug the ball upward with the stream. (thinking out loud) If you set up the stream on your left and ball on your right, then the majority of the water will be impacting on the left face of the ball and flinging off in the upper-left quadrant. Thinking that the water flinging off would impart a tug to the upper-left as the water layer on the ball tries to maintain that surface tension. That up/left force (together a few more nuanced forces at play) need only be strong enough to counter gravity and the right-ward impact force from the stream to maintain a general equilibrium. The effective center of mass would also move toward the left face where most of the water is collected, so I&#39;d imagine there are other interesting effects at play here.<br><br>Also thinking that by the time the water has reached the far side of the ball it&#39;d have lost too much momentum (maybe not the correct quality) to be useful for pushing off of. The video even shows at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNHp8iyyIjo&amp;t=3m45s\">3:45</a> that the ball is starting to lift up before the water begins flinging off the lower-right quadrant. It even gets pulled left into the stream first (assuming he didn&#39;t impart any force himself) though I&#39;m not as confident in my reasoning on that part.<br><br>Final thought: if the water pushing off the far side were enough to lift the ball, could you replicate the effect with a small water stream directly under the ball to demonstrate how much upward force it&#39;d take to lift the ball?<br><br>Great video!", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:47:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vastrain s", "comment_text": "I call hax", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:47:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yav1n", "comment_text": "all this slo mo water is incredibly relaxing haha", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:47:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luuk de Ruijter", "comment_text": "isn&#39;t this the magnus affect with water?", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:46:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Furqaan Thakur", "comment_text": "Africa in Kids could have water that eaten which wasted you.", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:46:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rithik Gandhi", "comment_text": "Me: finally a video from backyard scientist.<br>oops wrong channel , right science", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:46:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "phaoyu", "comment_text": "So what you need is an optimised wetting between liquid and ball.", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:46:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jukeb0y", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s try this with an hydrophobic ball!!!", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:46:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T.A.", "comment_text": "I want more content!", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:45:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laurence Ranson", "comment_text": "it looks like the magnus effect is pushing it into it", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:45:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yeison", "comment_text": "awesome", "comment_date": "2017-06-26T16:45:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frederik Huber", "comment_text": "You could check if that explanation is correct by covering the ball in oil (or another hydrophobic substance).

That brings the ball&#39;s center of mass inward toward the water stream which make the ball rotate around a center that is slightly toward the stream of water.  If you think about it, that will cause the ball to rotate around an axis that pushes it in toward the stream of water.  This naturally balances in a feedback loop.
