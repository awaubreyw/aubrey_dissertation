There are numerous advantages to that over pilling yourself with supplements, such as: 1. More stable source: you are sure that most of the vitamin is active (also the so called protiens products and even the natural protein sources are not stable orally!). 2.Fibre: good for bowl and Wight control. 3. Modest amount: less side effects (applies to amino acids* intake as well). 4. Gastrointestinal relief (usually high alkalinity and less concentration). 5. Won&#39;t increase your appetite too much (bcz of the concentration difference again).<br><br>Some people will argue sugar intake will increase.. OK this will be bad when you only drink the fruits, where usually no fibre there and lots of sugar bcz of many pieces of fruits needed for a one cup<br><br>*notice I said amino acids bcz I don&#39;t quite understand why people say proteins (unless if they were injectables). Proteins are very sensitive collection of amino acids, and have two big issues if taken orally, they will be degraded by stomach acidity and they won&#39;t be absorbed systematically because they are very big (the latter issue could be related to vitamin B12 with some people).

Im sure they took allot of time to make however in future projects i think it could be better spent elsewhere. Perhaps you could find a different more effective way to break up the video and achieve a similar effect in future projects. That said, it was the only part i didnt like about the documentary, which is a great accomplishment given how nit picky it is. Overall really good work. <br><br>Also, although the streaming quality was good, i did not like the service you used to publish the documentary and would definitely prefer to see it on more traditional services such as the google play store and itunes store. That said they did take paypal and didnt require me to make an account so i was happy about that. And the price to both buy and rent were more than fair and well with it.

I genuinely enjoy your videos, however, I have a small gripe regarding your advertisement of Vitamania. You advertise yourself as a doctor on your website link, which, I know to be technically true due to your ph.d. When people link to your website they may see you as an authority on medicinal studies, even though your ph.d is in physics education research. I am not trying to say a ph.d in that is not relevant to the movie you make. The point I am trying to make is that when a layperson sees Dr. In front of a name on a video about health topics they regard that person as an authority on the matter (e.g Dr. Oz). Although you at least ARE in fact a Doctor, whereas Oz is not. I am concerned your advertisement branch went a little overboard in trying to sell this movie, and you may be unintentionally marketing yourself as a Ph.d in medicine to those who do not know better.", "comment_date": "2018-08-15T13:05:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "user255", "comment_text": "Golden rice could save those kids.", "comment_date": "2018-08-15T12:54:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "user255", "comment_text": "Of course you can overdose vitamins!!

I now make my own vitamin drink with fresh vegetables and fruit in the blender and I drink that in the morning I also add turmeric powder and the dash of Virgin Olive Oil to my drink... a pill a day doesn&#39;t give you the benefits of fresh vegetables best to get the organic if you can and be sure you wash your vegetables thoroughly before you eat them... just to let people know about my own experience I want to save other lives before they end up like me...", "comment_date": "2018-08-14T14:14:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VIRAJ NAGRE", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6Bg4GzCGs&amp;t=1m28s\">1:28</a>......CRIMSON IRONY !!!!", "comment_date": "2018-08-14T14:11:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Srikanth Premkumar", "comment_text": "Hey you are in my home town... that&#39;s awesome...
