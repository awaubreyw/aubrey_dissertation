The layer closest to the skin is pulled along nearly at the speed of the surface itself while the layer furthest away is hardly in motion. The entire sandwich of layers influenced by the surface itself is quite thin, but if it is in laminar flow, it provides lubrication allowing the body to slide through the water. It is very difficult to establish laminar flow. The slightest irregularity, a bump, sharp edge, or natural roughness is enough to spoil laminar flow and cause turbulent flow. Turbulent flow, in which water in contact with the skin or fabric swirls violently in a tangle of microscopic eddies, causes friction that robs the swimmer of speed, power, and efficiency. It is unlikely that the human body can attain laminar flow in all but a few minor places.

Just, laminar flows are not only a game. In aviation they&#39;re kind of a holy grail. As the airfoils in an aircraft wing are able to  drastically reduce the shape drag, ideally you want to have laminar flow to reduce the skin friction drag (in contrast to a golf ball where you need to reduce the shape drag). But as it was rightly said in the video, at the flight Reyonolds number of a large commercial airplane there&#39;s no chance to keep the boundary layer laminar along the wing chord. Much research has been done in this direction. Some airplanes though can do that, in fact they are specifically designed and built to achieve laminar flow over 60%+ of the upper and lower wing surfaces.... Fancy to know what kind of aircraft can do that? Those are the modern high performance gliders (see my channel), whose airfoils are spefically designed to delay the transition of the boundary layer as much aft as possible. Thanks to the laminar flow (and to therir high aspect ratio wings) modern gliders can fly with Lift to Drag ratios of over 50, which means for every mile of altitude loss the glider will fly a distance of 50+ miles.

Maybe they should try it with a live fish and see how it makes out, does it get a measurable benefit and if so, how much.  It could help explain why some fish, salmon for instance, can travel such long distances up rivers to spawn.  What I really want to know is if the turbulent flow helps them when they have to jump up falls or dams.  Maybe in a dam the flow could be adjusted to the optimum level that would help the fish the most so more would survive to reproduce.  Just dreaming a bit here.... dam operator sees the first fish and calls down &quot;Hey Joe, here come the fish!  Turn the flow to the big green arrow.

I have experimented a good bit with aerodynamics with both aircraft and automobiles.  A vortex generator creates a small tornado which in itself is a low pressure zone which by its nature tends to stick to the surface and causes the laminar flow to stick closer to the upper surface of the wing.  At lower speeds and therefore higher angles of attack this helps by creating more lift due to the tornadoes tendency to stick to the surface also by causing more airflow over the ailerons which makes the aircraft more controllable.  At higher speeds the aircraft can be flown with less angle of attack a produce less drag still maintaining level flight.  When vortex generators are installed properly the aircraft can fly slower and enjoy the benefit of slower stall speeds, better handling, higher to speed and/or lower fuel consumption.", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T18:38:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GhostTitanium", "comment_text": "my fluids final is in 3 days", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T18:34:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yourmum Ghey", "comment_text": "But is it better than even flow", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T17:14:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damien Doisher", "comment_text": "Not to your heating systems it&#39;s not lol", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T16:26:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Garrett Reynolds \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8", "comment_text": "Ah yes Osborne Reynolds, the man who made the greatest number in existence.", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T16:06:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "real road ministries", "comment_text": "I shall now use flushable wipes.

Sure enough, on day 3 it rained. What I gather from this is that in ancient times, saints had mastered the technique of causing turbulance through huge number of people engaging in chants using specific scripts that led to phonation that travelled higher up and cause rain clouds to form and encourage precipitation. Long and loud group chants involving praise of lord Shiva and or lord Vishnu (Sri Krishna) have been the foundation of vedic life. This system of chanting has been used prolifically to ward off diseases in Ancient India. I just felt that the application of turbulance in ancient times and studying cosmic chaos thru turbulance is something that got blended into my thought through your video.

The teeth are really teeth, 100&#39;000s of them, small but also razor sharp. cause very energy efficient, sharks can swim also fast, but only for short time.  The Dolphin skin: very smooth, bolstered by a chambered layer with low viscosity oil, which absorbs any difference in pressure and hence keeping the flow laminar. Dolphins can swim very fast, yet need more energy for the same speed ... which is not an issue for them as mammals. Ordinary fish are kind of in between, with some cheats like the mucus on their surface.<br>So, as always, the purpose of the structural stuff is important.<br>yet, generally I prefer turbulence, not only in flows, but also in the abstract realm, as they are the seeds for order, compartmentalization, and organization, and such they are at the bottom of self-organization", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T21:14:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mona Lu", "comment_text": "Did anyone else thing of a Tesla valve when seeing These semi-turbulent clouds towards the endlich of that fascinating Video?", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T16:32:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mona Lu", "comment_text": "I wonder, why they have installiert turbulence generators permanently.

And with more jobs everywhere, everyone will have more for each other and dollars will go further everywhere. All the kids playing on dad&#39;s monopoly game will have a fun life and get back to serving one another.

Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there&#39;s solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320.

One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work.

In cruise flight the speed on top of the wing is above mach 1, and when further back on the wing the speed drops back to below the speed of sound it creates a shock wave which induces flow separation which we call shock stall. The vortex generators make very strong turbulent flow (that is correct) which reduces the flow separation due to the shock wave and consequently the aircraft can fly faster.", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T20:31:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Palella", "comment_text": "you are biased and paid off by Big Turbulence", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T17:22:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "~Reiji", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zI9sG3pjVU&amp;t=4m09s\">4:09</a> Why is there an anime girl moaning in the background?", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T13:31:12Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Will Gordge", "comment_text": "If you go canoeing look at examples of vortex shedding created by the disturbance of the paddle in the water, you can see the water spirals directly behind the paddle&#39;s path and the turbulence caused in its wake later on.", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T12:10:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bob John", "comment_text": "Was I the only one hearing KSP music at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zI9sG3pjVU&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a>?", "comment_date": "2021-02-01T17:48:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Rich", "comment_text": "In my 10+ years of experience working on fighter jets I came to the conclusion that dirty jets fly better.

Turbulence can&#39;t be defined by predictability. That you can predict von-Karman wave shedding of turbulent flows isn&#39;t a contradiction to the definition at all. It&#39;s the other way around. Laminar flow is just defined by the simplifiction of an unseperated flow be absolutely ensured true by reynolds number. So laminar theory is predicted to be reliably applicable. You will have no risk of harmonic periodics cause you material break unexpectedly fast. It&#39;s a safety and reliablity standpoint driven by attaching wings on aircraft and put people in and fly over cities. As you noted turbulent flow is everywhere in nature. <br><br>My fluid dynamics professor actually warned us of the desire to narrow down on laminar. Creating effects by laminar flow is the beauty of sth science toys and tricks we can do based on it&#39;s spectacular exceptions from a natural state. Turbulent flow does nothing spectacluar. Given that we all have encountered Tsunami and Hurricane footage destroing human habitats before.<br><br>For my biz in tidal energy flow is turbulent anways. Turbulent flow does have way higher kinetic energy in a 3 dimensional way including all 3 translational and 3 spin axis. Waves periodically forming is also always given. The fractal nature eventually just means you don&#39;t see them or notice their periodic length. Whitewater kayakers and surfer instinctively notice and exploit them.<br><br>That&#39;s only a technical limitation of sensors needed to trace all molecules in a flow in real time simulataneously. You can still simulate and nicely predict where all the larger  more relevant pressure vortex field distributions (energy and force direction) in total go. Limiting the technical questions down to laminar allow you to completly eliminate the time axis and work it out with a 2D static snapshot. A vastly different view in terms of tech needed to grasp the calculus with pencil &amp; paper. Maybe pocket calculator too.<br><br>Where and how large or small the periodic shedding of vortices in a turbulent flow is can be predicted with computer power. Calculate what resonating exitation in solid or flexible surfaces to ecxpect and strenthen the material accordingly to make it last. W/O we couldn&#39;t build any WWII propeller high speed fighter aircraft, jet fighters, reentry spacecraft like the Spaace Shuttle or the SR-71 spyplane. <br><br>The pain is with the math lovers when to cut out of the zoom in / zoom out of what you want look at. It&#39;s about number of permutations in the resolution you want to calculate. Chaos theory about amazonas butterfly wings trigger a hurricane in Florida holds no meaning for applied fluid dynamics engineering here.

Relax and chill. know when to use charts and tables i/o of a computer does it.<br><br>Laminar is the rare and beautiful exception. Sth that can still be done in an exam with a pocket calculator in minutes. You are taught the nature of things starting from the ultimate exception that never really happens anywhere. You are only close enough to lowest turbulence occuring that is plays no role anymore. There is always turbulence everywhere. It&#39;s just not plainly visible on your current zoom level and it has no impact on your experiment. That why exam question can be done w/o a computer and no one does want you to have a device capable to google and communicate in one.

I love your content, but have to say, you didn&#39;t do a great job explaining why - even a dead fish - can swim upstream.  In the section where you describe periodic vortex shedding and the  von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Vortex Street lies the answer.  You are way more knowledgeable than me, but you never discussed the high and low pressures created by laminar and turbulent flow.  For instance, you only discussed the turbulent flow over a wing, but not the laminar (like) flow underneath it thereby creating low and high pressure points or lift.  In water that horizontal like model is turned on its side.  During the periodic vortex shedding section you can see the low pressure areas created by the shedding and it&#39;s predictable as you describe.  My point, doesn&#39;t the fish sense the low pressure points of water rushing downstream and swims in them and avoids the more laminar like flow of the remaining water.  The von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Vortex Street shown in the clouds shows the path a fish would take.  I think if you could produce a video of the dead fish swimming upstream with the florescent die you would see the fish transition from one vortex to the next - staying between them (maybe on a tangent with the vortex).   Again, in the portion where you introduce periodic vortex shedding you can see the path required to take to move upstream.  This could also explain why the fish seems to wiggle as his swims upstream in addition to the wiggle created by his tail.

It is a trumpet of old, yet remains the trumpet of this time also. For My servant is soon entering his seventh year, and My Word and this Trumpet soon after. Lo, it is the seventh, and shall be blown for seven without ceasing, even as this seven sounds continuously before the time. <br>Behold, is it not also that which I have revealed which remains holy in My eyes, the fulfillment which has been long, followed by three which shall come in rapid succession, the fulfillment thereof short yet everlasting, even as the seventh with an eighth yet to come?<br><br>Therefore, thus says The Lord: I have trumpeted the call to awake, yet who has heard My call? Who has given heed and walked according to the will of The Lord? Wicked and slothful generation, DEAF CHILDREN, you have forsaken Me! For you have filled this world with every kind of evil; behold, you have reached new heights in wickedness! Thus I must blot out the kingdoms of men! I must wipe them away and cast them from My sight forever!... Never again shall they arise! Never again shall the nations do evil in My sight! Never again shall they walk proudly, shaking their fists toward Heaven in their self-proclaimed glory! Never again shall they revel in all these perversions and practice all these abominations, seeking always to satisfy their ever-increasing lusts as they pursue evil gain! FOR I AM THE LORD, AND I HAVE SEEN IT!<br><br><br>Therefore I shall speak, and this Trumpet <br>Shall sound continually until the time;<br>And when it is finished, another shall sound...<br><br>And oh what a cry shall be heard, <br>Oh what bitter weeping shall fill the streets;<br>And like the sound of a plague of locusts <br>Devouring every green thing, so shall the <br>Sound of gnashing teeth devour the air; <br>Behold, it shall break out in every <br>Corner with a great noise!...<br><br>Yet I shall continue to speak, and in My hot <br>Displeasure I shall pronounce judgment upon them!...<br><br>And whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, <br>The voice of YAHUWAH shall be heard!<br><br><br>For I tell you the truth, this Trumpet before you is but the beginning, a whisper from The Almighty, a still small voice spoken in the ear. For the day is coming quickly when I shall speak My name aloud! Behold, I shall open My mouth and into the air I shall speak, and the heavens shall tremble and the earth shall shake violently! For none in the earth know Me, not one sees Me as I truly am. Yet all shall know Me! For by My judgments they shall know, and in My Mercy they shall see, says The Holy One, The God of Israel, The God of power and fierce jealousy, The God who has come forth from His sanctuary to punish, The God of Judgment!<br>Behold, The Mighty One of Jacob has spoken in His authority, yet few have given heed, few have bowed down to give Me glory, few have cupped the ear. Therefore I shall speak louder, and the sound of My voice shall increase throughout the earth, and the days shall be turned into darkness before the Great and Terrible Day of The Lord! For in My anger, I shall turn My face against this awful generation, and in the fierceness of My wrath, I shall bring down My hand hard upon all peoples of the earth! And all these tall mountains shall crumble under the weight of My presence, and all these lofty hills shall be bowed down... Behold, the giants shall fall! Says The Lord. They shall be crushed beneath the weight of their fallen riches! Says The Almighty. <br>Therefore look among the nations, O foolish people, and watch, O most wicked generation, and be utterly astounded, be horribly afraid! For The God of Recompense is risen up, The God of Glory is come out! Behold, I am risen up in My vengeance, I am come out to repay! For I have looked and I have seen; yes, I have beheld your hearts, and I have looked upon all your doings, and I HAVE SEEN IT! For nothing is hidden from My eyes, neither are My ears dull of hearing! <br>Therefore be dismayed, O unfeeling generation, be dismayed, all you who have shown no mercy toward your neighbor, and tremble in fear at the indignation of The Lord! For behold, I shall kindle a fire in your courts that can not be quenched, and it shall rage, until every abomination is consumed and every wicked way perishes from before My face!... Let their faces be blackened with soot! Let the multitudes fall in their weariness! Says The Lord. For who can endure the Day of The Lord?! Who is able to escape the wrath of God when it comes?! Who has the stamina to flee continually, without respite?! Yet those who wait upon The Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint, as it is written.<br><br>Excerpt from: <a href=\"https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/The_Last_Trumpet_before_The_Time\">https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/The_Last_Trumpet_before_The_Time</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:50:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sobreaver", "comment_text": "I like turbulence everywhere !

I think this subject needs an uplifting spin put on it. And I mean exactly that. Since you hit a golf ball with a wedge a lot of rotation is imparted on the ball with the lower edge traveling forward dragging (put intended) air with it. The air on the bottom of the ball is slowed down, relative to the ball, and the air on the top of the ball is sped up. This creates lift just like the sails on Jacques Cousteau&#39;s boat and much like an airplane wing. Thus, like a glider with wings that will travel farther than a ballistic glider that does not have wings, I propose that the dimples on a golf ball aid in creating lift which helps the ball travel further. They do this by increasing the skin friction drag so the spin of the ball is more efficient at creating lift than a smooth surface. Thus by adding drag the dimples help the ball travel further.", "comment_date": "2020-09-01T03:19:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Black", "comment_text": "Where can I get a list of all the problems with $1,000,000 prizes for solving?", "comment_date": "2020-09-01T02:35:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carol Tedford Pruitt", "comment_text": "Um, miss?

For higher angles of attack, which is where the VG&#39;s are effective, the flow boundary layer transitions to the turbulent state very close to the leading edge. The effect of the VG&#39;s is to re-energize the already turbulent boundary layer, which prevents separation (and the dangerous loss of lift that result from this). As long as the boundary layer is &quot;energetic&quot; enough, it does not separate. So the function of the VG&#39;s is simply to re-energize the already turbulent boundary layers, which delays separation.  The result of this is that the lift can get higher (the airplane does not &quot;fall out of the sky&quot;) than it would be able to without the VG&#39;s. <br>VG&#39;s are also used in other applications, such as on wind turbine blades. But in all cases they are used to re-energize already turbulent boundary layers. <br>The transition from a laminar to a turbulent boundary layer can be &quot;forced&quot; using small roughness elements, which are usually much smaller than VG&#39;s. Airplane gliders use specially made &quot;zig-zag-tape&quot;/turbulator-tape for this. This is typically 0.5mm high.

The P-51 mustang performed so well in part because of it&#39;s laminar wing. Gliders all have laminar wings now.<br>And there are even experiments (by DLR) performed to use boundary layer suction to give the vertical stabilizer of an airliner laminar flow to save fuel. Airbus also has a A340 prototype with laminar outer wings.<br><br>The reason why large airplanes don&#39;t use laminar flow is because disturbed laminar flow causes more friction than turbulent flow, and regulations say you need to be prepared for the worst. So using a laminar wing, although probably more efficient, causes you to have to carry more fuel. This is because you might encounter flies on take-off and have to carry those the entire flight with you, with the high drag penalty as a result. To deal with this, researchers are looking into ways to shed the effected part of the wing (around the stagnation point) after take-off or fold it away.<br><br>The effect of disturbances is quite large. This is why competition gliders carry bug-wipers, devices to literally wipe the disturbances off the wing. The effect of a single fly on the front of a solar car in the Australian race is several minutes, if it was carried the entire way.<br><br>So laminar flow is actually much more efficient, but it&#39;s harder to maintain. If laminar flow is disturbed to turbulent uncontrolled, it causes more drag than flow that&#39;s turbulent from the start.

BUT if you&#39;d increase the speed even further, a smooth golf ball would experience a similar drop, and the coefficient of drag would go even lower than with a dimpled ball, and significantly so. This is why golf ball dimples aren&#39;t really a solution for all kinds of applications. They depend on the scale, the velocity, and the balance/distribution between skin friction and pressure drag, among other things. For a golf ball these dimples increase skin friction, but the gains (at their usual velocities) from reduced pressure drag help more, but that doesn&#39;t hold true for e.g. planes.", "comment_date": "2020-07-17T10:01:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Teoria de Tudo", "comment_text": "One of the best videos I\u2019ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2020-07-17T03:19:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Idek Bruh", "comment_text": "Turbulent flow is beautiful, also better than laminar!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-07-17T01:34:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Achyut Arjun", "comment_text": "Wait...what?

In fact, every second order phase transition creates that: magnets at the Curie temperature, or fluids in their critical temperature (creating the &quot;critical opalescence&quot;). Actually, in 1987 a theory was proposed to describe complex systems in terms of critical phase transitions, since in complex systems you often observe quantities that extend over many scales. The theory is called &quot;Self-Organized Criticality&quot; (proposed by Bak, Tang and Wisenfeld). It&#39;s been a wide area of research over the last 30 years, and nowadays it&#39;s believed that the activity in the brain presents a sort of self-organization around (close to) the critical point. Other phenomena, such as solar flares, earthquakes, avalanches, etc, are also theoretically (and sometimes experimentally) shown to obey such laws of Self-Organized Criticality.", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T15:26:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sonu kr", "comment_text": "Wow!!", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T14:42:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hen ko", "comment_text": "everyone gangsta till the KSP music starts playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zI9sG3pjVU&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T14:19:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheMajorLee", "comment_text": "Laminar Gang!! xD", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T13:04:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Markimoop", "comment_text": "laminar flow gang rise up (but not too fast)", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T12:10:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trentsum", "comment_text": "Googles DeepMind Artificial Intelligence can probably help predict the final state of turbulent flow.", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T11:07:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "vamsi harish", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t understand a damn thing that explain in your videos..

You showed how the airflow reacts to wings with and without vortex generators, but I don&#39;t believe you made the connection between attached airflow following the surface and lift. Intuitively, stall will happen the more perpendicular the wing is to the airflow which seems to be its own kind of turbulent flow (as evidenced by the strings going wild) - so, the vortex generators are using turbulent flow to solve a problem originally caused by turbulent flow in the first place. At any rate, it is unclear to me how having more attached airflow over the wing allows for maintaining lift. Or am I supposed to infer that having more attached airflow helps maintain lift because it cannot be pushing downward on the wing if it&#39;s following the surface?

In the atmosphere warm air and cold are laminar until they meet each other or a ground obstacle. When a cold front collides with a warm front thunderstorms and tornadoes occur.  Newtons law of motion can apply to air flow just as easily as it does to an object.

One of the major properties of the turbulent flow is the varying speeds. Heck, that&#39;s even a trait of laminar flow.

What about with turbulent flow? Within each of those eddies, there are laminae. The flow within the Eddie is laminar (and bulk).

However the high-pressure gasses that follow need to be captured by the baffles to contain the blast and trap the gasses long enough for them to cool down, dissipating their energy before the gasses are slowly released. A good silencer must be made out of materials that can withstand high pressures and temperatures, and must have some degree of reducing the noise to hearing-safe levels. The technology has improved dramatically over the past decade, with new innovations in products like modular suppressors that can add or remove baffle sections to shorten or lengthen the overall dimensions, or 3D printed designs that can have internal volumes and geometries that would be impossible to manufacture with other means. There are even flow-through designs which try to reduce gasses that build up pressure and get directed back down the barrel into the weapon system (known as &#39;back pressure&#39;).

If you can justify throwing computers on top of computers to solve a problem, you can resolve length and time scales of turbulent structures/Kolmogorov scale, using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). This however, though, is very computationally expensive. As far as I know, there are no DNS solutions over an aircraft in cruise configuration; at high Reynolds number, due to low scales required. (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong here!)<br>Also, high Reynolds numbers does not guarentee turbulence. By linear stability theory, there are 2 important Re values we need to consider, let&#39;s call them Re0 and Re1. Now, due to some effects (effects like noise, gust, geometry etc.)<br>there will be disturbances occuring inside the fluid. These distubances are not important until Re_cr, or equally, Re0. The waves are stable <del>for sure</del> below Re_cr. However, the waves get amplified after Re0.(possibly into Tollmien-Schlicting waves, then hairpin vortices and then fully turbulent spots if Re permits)  Furthermore, the waves amplify until Re1 and then the waves are not amplified further. Now, the amplification ratio is A(remember that we do not know the value of initial disturbance but we can find the ratio), and ln(A) is generally taken as 9, which is a good estimate to obtain transition Re. (ln(A) is also known as n-factor). So, under right circumstances, there will be no transition even if you go insanely high Re.<br>Finally, there may be less pressure drag in turbulent flows, even though the skin friction coefficient (C_f) is higher, drag coefficient may be lower.", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T20:19:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Farrukh Saif", "comment_text": "Veritasium vs Smarter Every Day lets goooo", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T20:15:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray van Wayenburg", "comment_text": "The correct formula is: Turbulent Flow = America\u2019s Political System.", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T20:09:10Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Christopher DuVall", "comment_text": "More awesome until you are taking the MCAT and have to solve the math of it \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T20:02:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GamePoy", "comment_text": "Just keep those Muscular Mannies away.", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T19:55:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tosh B", "comment_text": "Unfortunately YouTube compression doesn&#39;t seem to like turbulent flow very much", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T19:51:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Monkey D Faris", "comment_text": "sometimes i wish youtube had a super like botton so i can press it on the videos i super enjoy , Thanks", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T19:50:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SnackWatch \ud83e\uddb7", "comment_text": "I saw laminar flow and was expecting Destin\u2019s appearance.

Vortex Generators\u2014<br>Aircraft mechanic and aerospace nerd here:  A high Angle of Attack at a high speed might rip your wings clean off.  You don&#39;t (typically) climb at a high AOA, although your pitch angle may be high, but that&#39;s relative to the ground.  AOA is the wing chord relative to the air stream vector \u2013 a metric based on a reference frame fixed to the aircraft itself.  Most controlled flight, (not including acrobatics or edge-of-the-envelope practice,) happens with a low angle of attack, and in those periods, vortex generators don&#39;t do anything useful.  They don&#39;t aid efficiency \u2013 they add drag after all.<br>A high AOA happens in low-speed maneuvers, the most common being landing.  If you can sustain lift at a higher AOA, thanks to adding VGs on the same aircraft, you can reduce the landing speed by quite a bit.  Business jets tend to be very slipery, and without the VG&#39;s on the wing they would land at even higher speeds, requiring longer runways, increasing wear on the gear and brakes, and increasing the hazards of the landing process (like stability if the air is... well... too turbulent at landing.) <br>Keeping flow attached at high AOAs also helps the ailerons to do their job, since they&#39;re at the back edge where flow separates first, and this helps the pilot keep the wings level at touchdown.  Er.. even moreso in...  Turbulent Conditions. \ud83d\ude00<br>One might climb very steeply, at a high angle of attack and low forward speed, in order to surmount an obstacle, such as taking off from a tiny valley airstrip in the mountains and trying to get over the mountain pass ahead of you.  But as soon as the plane levels off a bit and picks up speed, the horizontal stabilizer (I&#39;m ignoring pilot input, trim, etc.) will weather-vane the aircraft into the &quot;relative wind&quot;, bringing the AOA down closer to the chord line again.  VGs are useful in the same regimes where extended flaps are useful, and VGs enhance the effectiveness of flaps too.  <br>Just...

But I think I might be able to articulate my thoughts well enough for the concept (of my idea) to be undersood. <br><br>Turbulent and laminar flow are two sides of the same coin. The main difference is in their respective energy states and the number of interactions after/during disturbance. Increase the number of interactions, or the amount of energy exchange during the interaction, and you increase the turbulence. <br><br>Predicting turbulence is possible to a degree, but you would have to know: <br><br>a) the composition/geometry of the materials involved; b) the molecular positioning of all involved materials; c) the energy states; d) the direction/composition/energy/duration of the disturbing entity.<br><br>The problem is, in certain conditions, I imagine even quantum fluctuations can have an impact on the results. Even if you were able to measure everything to such a minute level, keeping track of each item, knowing how each interactions with another, and performing the necessary equations to predict the next stage of interactions, you would need to perform this equation billions upon billions of times simultaneously and instantaneously. We are not omniscient. <br><br>Maybe in a controlled situation where you have a pure fluid, that only reacts by way of kinetic energy but this interaction doesn&#39;t alter the fluid in any other way besides temperate and movement. It resides in a well understood and measured container, and is subjected to a short, well measured and understood sound wave. If you already know how the fluid behaves when subjected to sound, you could predict the interactions and state when,and for how long there will be turbulence. You could even extrapolate the movent patterns if the sounds were to be continuous. But again, there would come a point where the calculations required would become astronomical. Like trying to find the end of Pi. \ud83e\udd2b Maybe Pi has the answer?<br>Maybe all I&#39;ve done here is illustrate the difficulty in attempting to accurately predict turbulence.

Surface of sun on the other hand, consists of plasma, the so called fourth state of matter. One may argue that plasma is nothing but super hot gas, and hence a fluid, so you can still use the terms laminar and turbulent but consider this : fluid particles at normal temperatures have much smaller energy when compared to the super hot plasma particles. The energy in plasma is so high that atoms break into nuclei and electrons. So you can control the viscosity of normal temperature fluids by controlling their temperature but plasmas, they form only on high energies and hence by default have high &quot;viscosity&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:10:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "znyan", "comment_text": "you lost me at the dead fish swimming upstream wtf", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:09:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arpit Agarwal", "comment_text": "ChemE unite", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:08:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Smith", "comment_text": "I died when Destin&#39;s face popped up &quot;LAMINAR FLOW&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:08:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sm", "comment_text": "Dead fish??", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:08:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thescientist", "comment_text": "This was just one big burn to smarter every day", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:08:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "__", "comment_text": "Somebody hide this from Destin, quick.", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:08:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S H A S H A N K A", "comment_text": "The only thing i&#39;m surprised is about the dead fish swimming....But doesn&#39;t the dead fish float?", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:07:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dario Dominkovic", "comment_text": "The way i study and write my exams is literally Turbulent Flow", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T14:07:06Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Bill D. in Iowa", "comment_text": "Turbulence is better because it is psychedelic!

Both of you were right, both of you can agree to each other and both of you can disagree, which creates a wonderful dynamic and makes the whole material far more interesting.<br>Years ago, in Poland, a TV scientific program was shown, where two talented mans, Andrzej Kurek and Zdzislaw Kaminski presented the newest achievements in science and technology. This was so far, in my experience the best program in the world (far better than current Discovery channels). They presented different points of view, they discussed, argued in a very interesting way, showing sometimes opposite points of view. They died in car accident, and since then, no better program of such value was even made. BUT! Your short conversation with Destin showed the same dynamic, and brang lot&#39;s of joy to the subject. I think that if you are interested in spreading and gaining attention to the channel, you can try to prepare more such scenarios, where not only you are interviewing somebody, but also you can argue with somebody, presenting things which are not as clear and one-dimensional as it seems. I know that your channel and production is set in a bit different mood, because you are presenting the truth, the simple, yet beautiful physical world, and they - in Polish TV presented achievements of technology (which is different), but still, if you find somebody who has a bit different point of view, you can not only as that person but also take a stand where you know something, which is certain, and he/she knows something which is certain, and if those points of view, or discoveries contradicts themselves, you will have an astounding material, which also can generate lot&#39;s of comments and even go viral. Remember those balls? It was not about science, it was about technology. What if you find somebody to argue that this was actually a bad idea? We all know that technology has its dark side too, like the environmental impact, etc. So many areas to cover! :) So many opportunities! :) I would love to see what is THE TRUTH about nuclear energy, what the heck is true with the &#39;green&#39; energy, etc. Anyway, good luck, I love your productions, and I think Discovery and other semi-scientific channels can learn a lot from you!", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T12:41:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iris Candy", "comment_text": "Hello veritasium", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T12:40:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JhiArtz.", "comment_text": "Marbles", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T12:39:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "swancrunch", "comment_text": "so. where is my golfball-dimpled sportscar?", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T12:38:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julio figo", "comment_text": "very cool!", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T12:38:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon", "comment_text": "Didn&#39;t know I had this unfounded love for laminar flow when I should&#39;ve been loving turbulent.

If you think about it, it&#39;s pretty crazy that something will get less drag when it gets faster! Imagine being pushed back by a strong wind, then suddenly it becomes a giant gale but it&#39;s actually easier to move through! The phenomenon also has the cool  title of &#39;The Drag Crisis&#39;. <br>As a bit of fun history, it was Gustave Eiffel - designer of the famous Eiffel Tower in France - who discovered this phenomenon. He was a prolific experimentalist and had one of the first wind tunnels (like those shown for the experiments here) installed under the tower. What&#39;s more he used to drop balls of different sizes from the tower and measure their time to hit the ground in order to calculate their drag. Unlike Galileo and his similar experiment on the Tower of Pisa, Eiffel was looking for the effect of wind resistance/drag not for the constancy of gravity.<br><br>The design of the golf ball is very impressive, but there are other ways to improve the boundary layer than triggering it to turbulence. One that I particularly like is to suck the low momentum particles next to the wall THROUGH the wall (using a porous wall like a sponge). The fast (high momentum) particles from the free-stream then take its place, preventing separation. It&#39;s an old idea, and some prototype planes were designed with wings that did this during WWII to get the edge over enemy air forces. In the end, simplicity won out, and the moving flap took the winning place for controlling the flow over a wing. This stimulates the boundary layer over the wing by redirecting high momentum air from under the wing over the boundary layer, allowing the plane to take steeper angles of attack. &#39;Boundary layer suction&#39; as its called has since been relegated as a &#39;cool idea that isn&#39;t worthwhile&#39; since then. But thanks to modern simulation software we can find ways to use suction more effectively to get much greater effects.<br><br>This is what my PhD research is on, and you can see a video with some simulations on my channel if you&#39;re interested (though the production value is MUCH lower than Veritasium) and, alas, the flow is laminar! <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jX7N_si5TwE\">https://youtu.be/jX7N_si5TwE</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T08:21:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vighnesh Bhat", "comment_text": "Are eddy currents also turbulent", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T08:19:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kwint", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zI9sG3pjVU&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a> whats that fluid called", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T08:18:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fahad Mansoor", "comment_text": "Top 10 anime battles of 2020 laminar flow (Destin) vs turbulent flow (veritasium)", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T08:17:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Henderson", "comment_text": "I&#39;d like to see a video on the fractal geometry present in Turbulent Flow.

First of all, people might understand something very wrong from what he says here... Yes the blood coming out of the aorta is turbulent, but the very essence of nornal blood dynamics is that it HAS to flow in a laminar manner, since turbulent blood flow causes many troubles. People with high blood pressure basically have problems with their blood vessels, either due to them being incompliant or atherosclerotic, and THAT causes turbulent flow and thus many health problems later on. Atrial fibrillation in the heart causes turbulent blood flow, and that changes the dynamics of the blood and may cause thrombosis and CVA... And besides, since laminar flow is the exception by actually &#39;opposing&#39; to the number one rule in chemistry (the one that says the atrophy in the system has to grow no matter what happens), you have to respect laminar flow when you see it. In other words, turbulent flow is much more prevalent than laminar flow, and you don&#39;t have to make any effort for it to happen...

There&#39;s a section behind and under the curl of a wave that you can ride with little energy output. As the wave and water particles move forward, energy is funneled between the air above, and the surface below. A barrel is formed when this energy is funneled more precisely as it hits a reef for instance. This barrel exhibits both turbulent and laminar flow. Under and behind the barrel is a low pressure system with slow moving water. Completely under, the energy is forced out of line by the reef, and up and around this low pressure system. With nowhere else to go, besides being chaotic and turbulent, and moves over the low pressure system, in a line, to form the lip of a barrel, creating laminar flow. This laminar flow feeds back into the chaotic turbulent flow. So with enough energy, this creates a feedback loop, which creates the most gnarly, rideable barrels, that only require you to paddle into. To paddle into it, you use the low pressure system or a mini Eddy...

It&#39;s limited to low Reynolds Numbers.<br>If the case in point is a circular pipe, the value of Reynolds number needs to be below about 2100 in order to maintain laminar flow conditions. (it also assumes that fully developed flow conditions have been attained).<br>In other words you can double the diameter of circular pipe and reduce the mean velocity by half and the Reynolds number will not change assuming the viscosity and density is the same. (Re = D\u03bd\u03c1/\u03bc - dont forget that density is also a variable in Reynolds Number. Re does not equal vL/viscosity as shown in this video. Reynolds Number, is a dimensionless quantity so there are no units for the values you obtain. Cant leave out the density term, even if it&#39;s assumed to be constant).<br>Although Particle Reynolds Number is still a ratio of the inertial to viscous forces in a flow system, the value for D (or L) is not the size of the container but rather the diameter of the particles.<br>The example of the smoke stream emanating from a candle is a good case in point. The reason the smoke particles are initially in a nice neat column and then spreading out into turbulent-like curls much higher up from the candle flame is dues to the initial temperature difference between the candle fumes and the surrounding air and the fact that thermal equilibrium conditions are eventually reached higher up.<br>Referring to Reynolds Number without providing a clear outline of what the parameters refer to can be misleading. <br>The stream that flows from a candle flame initially cannot be assumed to be laminar merely because it appears as near uniform tube-like flow. Within the stream the fine particles are moving in a turbulent like behaviour. They are not flowing upwards in laminar sheets with linear velocities that never move across the flow. Very close to the candle wick there will be a flow regime that will be laminar in nature. And also at the boundary between the upward flowing column and the surrounding air there will be special flow conditions. This is not a good example of laminar flow transitioning to turbulent flow if you look deeper. Imagine lighting the same candle in the same Laboratory environment but increasing the air temperature? That is, the fumes are rising in very hot air rather than the room temperature air. Or indeed you can decrease the ambient air temperature to near freezing. Do you think that the length of the column and the behaviour of the &quot;spread out&quot; turbulent region higher up will change with different ambient air temperatures.   <br>One way to demonstrate laminar and turbulent flow is to set up an experiment with a transparent pipe that introduces a dye withing the flow regime. Observe the behaviour of the dye stream within the flow as you increase the flow rate.", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T01:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SinHurr", "comment_text": "Buy more bidets, cowards.", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T01:15:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rico suave", "comment_text": "Do the experiment next to regular, 2-ply, and cheap-o toilet paper now!", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T01:15:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Hauser", "comment_text": "some vids call for more than one like button to click", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T01:15:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I/O", "comment_text": "Of course turbulent flow is more awesome; there even are apps to showcase its beauty, such as the one used at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zI9sG3pjVU&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T01:14:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MainDepth", "comment_text": "Angry destin noises", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T01:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "We Post Viral Videos", "comment_text": "Whoa!", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T01:12:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "devjock", "comment_text": "CPU watercooler blocks also use this combination of laminar flow and induced turbulence halfway through the hollow cooling element, to increase heat exchange.

During the coronavirus pandemic, the city was hit hard and the number of people infected in Stuttgart ranked third in Germany.\r<br>\r<br>As Germany has now reopened, Falun Gong practitioners held their first Information Day on the busiest street in Stuttgart, K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe. Many people watched practitioners demonstrate the Falun Gong exercises to the beautiful music.\r<br>\r<br>A young woman carefully followed along with the practitioners&#39; exercise movements during the exercise demonstration. She took an introductory flyer afterward and said she planned to read more about Falun Gong online.\r<br>\r<br>A young man picked up an introductory flyer for his friend who likes meditation. Another young man talked with a practitioner for a long time and said he was interested in learning Falun Gong. He was familiar with terms like De (virtue) and karma, because one of his friends had spent six years in a Chinese temple.\r<br>\r<br>A middle-aged woman said she would like to learn Falun Gong. She was happy to know that Falun Gong exercise instruction is always free. She took information about a local group-exercise site and said she planned to attend.\r<br>\r<br>A woman asked a practitioner why the CCP persecutes Falun Gong. The practitioner explained how Falun Gong\u2019s principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance oppose the CCP\u2019s wicked ideology of struggling against fellow man and nature. The practitioner also explained how the CCP had fabricated lies to smear Falun Gong to turn the populace against practitioners, and how it had used the same tactics of deception with the coronavirus pandemic.

I used to build high performance engines for various motorsport applications. When it comes to air flowing through an engine, turbulent flow is better because if the air to to smooth and laminar then the surface tension is higher and the air tends to be more &quot;sticky&quot; if you will. Clinging to the inside surfaces of the intake runners and slowing down. You need to break that air up so i can flow more freely. The opposite is true in an engine when it comes to liquids. When it comes to liquids like fuel and oil Laminar flow is better. Turbulent flow in a liquid can cause cavitation and aeration and when you are talking fuel, this will decrease the energy output per volume as the fuel becomes less dense. And with oil aeration can cause it to become less sticky and loose lubricating properties. and in hydraulic fluids like transmissions and power steering aeration means the fluid can now be compressed more then it could before, and again, you loose your ability to transfer energy through that fluid.  Also in the boating world the body of water your boat is riding on, actually works better if it&#39;s turbulent. Again if it&#39;s calm and laminar it has a greater surface area and surface tension, the boat tends to stick to it more. This creates more drag and less efficiently. But if you can break that water up and aerate it as it rushes under the hull, you&#39;ll both be able to go faster and have greater efficiency. By breaking up that surface tension you also break up the drag. So like i said.

The study also demonstrated that pipe flow resistance is the sole source of pipe flow resistance, and explained the nature of blood pressure, and the Bernoulli Principle. This is the essence of the new science of &quot;Chaos&quot; that is explained in a book of the same name by James Glieck, who was the science editor of the Wall Street Journal. True laminar pipe flow is virtually non-existent in familiar &quot;Newtonian&quot; fluids such as water, gasoline, steam, and atmospheric gases. Your examples merely illustrate situations where levels of pipe flow turbulence are very low; if you were to double the flow rate of the water in your examples you would observe exponential increases in turbulence that would inhibit flow rates and exaggerate lateral forces in the delivering pipe. True laminar pipe flow mostly exists in &quot;non-Newtonian&quot; fluids which consist of particulates suspended in the fluid that inhibit the formation of turbulent flow patterns when the fluid is accelerated. Mammalian blood is an obvious example of such a non-Newtonian fluid. The morphology and neutral bouyancy of mammalian red blood cells causes them to spontaneously form &quot;aggregates&quot; or &quot;Roleaux&quot; formations when blood is accelerated, and these formations prevent the formation of turbulent flow patterns. This is the secret of superior mammalian exercise tolerance as compared to other classes of vertebrates. The mammalian heart is able to eject its contents into the aorta in less than a tenth of a second because its red cells abolish turbulent flow resistance, so that mammalian blood flow is truly &quot;laminar.&quot; The faster that blood is accelerated in arteries (or pipes) the lower its flow resistance. In contrast, the red cells of poikilothermc amphibians, turtles, and reptiles are much larger and are evolved to exaggerate systolic turbulence to prevent atherosclerosis at ambient temperatures below 100 degrees Fahrenheit, where blood lipoproteins become solid particulates and deposit on the interior walls of arteries and cause atherosclerosis. The Hof study has essentially refuted the Hagen-Pouiessele equation, the notion of &quot;shear stress&quot; and other such antiquated assumptions. <a href=\"http://www.stressmechanism.com/\">www.stressmechanism.com</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-11T16:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Z", "comment_text": "Pshh.

And because of this they can do things you might not think of. Like increase span efficency with roll and seem to be able drop below flying speed in lift. Now part of that former is the relatively poor span efficiency of swept flying wings with 20 deg of twist and relative reduction of span (to gravity vector) with roll. But, when looking at the lift produced by the mid-span sections and positive incidence at those attitudes of the inside tip producing lift as it  goes into turbulent Reynolds #&#39;s it seems the efficiency goes up dramatically. And the proof can be seen when they are flying with high performance sailplanes and the hang gliders top out above. One of my favorite things to do in small thermals was to punch the bar out to beyond stall and sit on the core lift at the verge of a spin and just go up. Relative wind was like 90 deg to the wing, basically spinnaker mode.
