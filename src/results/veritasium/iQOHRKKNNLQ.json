[{"comment_by": "Ahmad Q", "comment_text": "Great videos as always. I am a diehard fan and have learnt so much from your videos. Thank you!<br><br>The thing that&#39;s bothering me the most about free fall is that why aren&#39;t the feet of astronauts tethered to the space station?  The space station as well as the astronauts are both in free fall at the same rate of g even though the space station has a larger gravitational force just because of its mass and the astronauts have a smaller force. What allows the astronauts to float in the space station? To give you a scenario - if you drop a bottle of water on earth, you don&#39;t see the water all swirling up or floating in the bottle - it stays at the bottom as the bottle falls. Similarly, if there is a foam cup with like a coin in it and the cup is dropped, you don&#39;t see the coin floating in the air. Its not the active force of the muscles of the astronaut as everything floats like pen or water droplets in space station. Can you please explain this concept? It is bugging the crap out of me and I just don&#39;t understand it. <br><br>Also, Einstein&#39;s happiest thought experiment was a guy in an elevator who goes in a free fall if the cables are cut. He said this scenario is the exact same situation as if the astronaut was in a vacuum i.e. space. How does having force in one scenario equate to no force in the other?<br><br>Thank you once again!", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T01:03:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dharmendra singh Rathore", "comment_text": "Ok,  but can u describe that if iss run on this speed then how is this possible for a astronaut to service or change the any part of iss out side....?<br>Is that time iss stop at a place...?", "comment_date": "2022-08-01T03:55:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eliza Jayne", "comment_text": "The up and down diving airplane, simulated the space station left and right diving...<br>The neutral zone of magnetism...<br>Floats metals ...not humans ..", "comment_date": "2022-07-22T11:44:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eliza Jayne", "comment_text": "Floating is an illusion.<br>No such thing as floating...<br><br>Floating in tails no velocity...<br>Astronauts floating is created by velocity..<br>Same as a diving plane ...<br>Astronauts velocity is falling from left to right , compared to air plane dive up and down ...<br><br>The space station travels very fast so astronauts looking like they float ...<br>But it\u2019s velocity...", "comment_date": "2022-07-22T11:42:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eliza Jayne", "comment_text": "They are not weightless , just moving very fast ...<br>Floating is created by velocity...<br>The illusion of floating is actually falling sideways ...", "comment_date": "2022-07-22T11:38:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Praneeth", "comment_text": "Why do people in aiplanes don&#39;t float then?", "comment_date": "2022-07-16T05:35:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GuruOnNet", "comment_text": "Falling sideways.", "comment_date": "2022-06-08T17:56:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GuruOnNet", "comment_text": "The &quot;need to know&quot; is the best tool to knowledge.
