Studies have SHOWN that foragers only had to spend about 14 hours a week locating enough food to feed everyone in their communities--both meat and vegetation, so they had MUCH MORE leisure time than you are giving them credit for. One reason so many people have reverted to versions of the &quot;paleo&quot; diet is because our gut bacteria are better suited to it. Secondly, agriculture, especially GRAIN horticulture, introduced forms of food that HAVE VERY LITTLE NUTRITIVE VALUE. The best outcome from such grains is beer. While you might love bread and the occasional bowl of oatmeal, most modern breads are not as wholesome as ancient grain breads and soups (beer, undoubtedly, started as a form of soup, which is why Sumerians drank it with straws). We get more nutritive value out of vegetables than we do grains, but grains are addictive (carbohyrdate addiction) and grain growing is heavily SUBSIDIZED by the American government because, in good years, are relatively easy to grow and the RAMP UP the GDP for the country.

It is really, really hard but it is not impossible. \r<br>\r<br>The biggest idea I am trying to express is tunneling aqueducts from the coast, in this case the west coast of the USA inland to feed combination geothermal power and sea water desalination plants.  The idea seems to be so big that no one has considered it possible but I believe it is not only possible but it is necessary. For over a century the fossil water contained in aquifers has been pumped out to feed agriculture, industry and municipal water needs. The natural water cycle cant refill fossil water deposits that were filled 10,000 years ago when the glaciers melted after the last ice age. Without refilling these aquifers there is not much of a future for the region of the United states. As a result ground levels in some areas of the San Joaquin Valley have subsided by more than 30 feet. Similar fossil water depletion is happening in other regions all around the world. TBM and tunneling technology has matured and further developments in the industry are poised to speed up the tunneling process and it&#39;s these tunnels that are the only way to move large volumes of water from the ocean inland. The water is moved inland to areas where it can be desalinated in geothermal plants producing clean water and power. In many cases the water will recharge surface reservoirs where it will be used first to make more hydro power before being released into rivers and canal systems. It&#39;s very important however to not stop tunneling at these first stops but to continue several legs until the water has traveled from the ocean under mountain ranges to interior states. Along the way water will flow down grade through tunnels and rise in geothermal loops to fill mountain top pumped hydro batteries several times before eventually recharging several major aquifers. What I am proposing is essentially reversing the flow of the Colorado River Compact.

Before the advent of agriculture - hunter-gatherers did not spend &quot;all day every day just finding food&quot;.

But, those quoted words are simply false. Hunter gatherers may have had more leisure time than agricultural societies. This is not hard to imagine in a lush landscape and a less human populated world, not restricting a groups migration. Just one mammoth, by the way, could feed a small group for a long time, and they learned to preserve the meat in water and probably other ways. There could also be ample food to be picked from flora. This should not just be labeled &quot;spending all day looking for food&quot;. They knew where to look, and picking fruits and nuts from trees for your clan is not exactly back-breaking work.

This makes us dependent on industrial production and global supply lines, while making us extremely vulnerable to any disruption or change of policy. Most of all, the surplus derived from fertilizer and industrial agriculture do not liberate people because it is not distributed equally. If productive capacity and efficiency made us wealthier, the work week would be shrinking. Instead the surplus becomes concentrated, creating a class who drive up prices of scarce things like homes and land.

Poland has been an exporter of potash for quite some time. The peak of potash production in Poland was achieved in the 17th and 18th centuries. Polish specialists in the production of potash were so valued that, on the initiative of Captain John Smith, they were brought by English colonists to America. On October 1, 1608, a group of Polish craftsmen, specialists in the production of soap, potash and glass, arrived at the first settlement of English colonists in North America called Jamestown on the British ship &quot;Mary and Margaret&quot; and established the first manufacturing factories on the American continent. The craftsmen producing potash were therefore the ancestors of the present-day American Polish community. Ignacy Krasicki, the poet, expressed the importance of potash production for the economy of the Republic of Poland in one of his epigrams:<br><br>&quot;If there were no potash<br>There would be no inventory;<br>The treasure is not worshiped enough<br>We have gallons from the ashes. &quot; -<br>Ignacy Krasicki (1735 - 1801)&quot;<br><br>Between 1420 and 1620, the primary exporting cities for wood-derived potash were Gda\u0144sk, K\u00f6nigsberg and Riga. From the 1640s, geopolitical disruptions (i.e. Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)) meant that the centres of export moved from the Baltic to Archangel, Russia. In 1700, Russian ash was dominant though Gda\u0144sk remained notable for the quality of its potash. In the late fifteenth century, London was the lead importer due to its position as the centre of soft soap making while the Dutch dominated as suppliers and consumers in the sixteenth century.", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T13:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Impulse", "comment_text": "Report this video for misleading titles, great channel but bad misleading titles is a stunt on us the viewers so the channel can make more money rather than being incentive to be honest, people should report this type of behaviour so content creators will learn how to be humble and honest.", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T13:02:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Filia Jean", "comment_text": "Anything MAN MADE is not PURE or NATURAL", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T13:00:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wayne hale", "comment_text": "Alien art", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T12:37:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Renata Cantore", "comment_text": "Thank you for being (1 of) The Most exciting science teachers ever !!!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udca1\ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T11:48:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aranos", "comment_text": "One thing you have wrong.

Perhaps what we can perceive, for example, corresponds to only about 10% of all that actually exists. Even the tools and instruments that we develop to better observe, measure and understand our environment (including the universe) are tools that are developed on the basis of our perception and mental/intellectual power. For example, the most complex instrument an ape is able to develop is a simple stick. His intellectual powers are insufficient to grasp/understand what lies beyond &quot;stick&quot;. <br>So it may be that we will never understand certain things because we cannot perceive/grasp them. This is not contradicted by the fact that our instruments are constantly improving and we understand our environment better and better. And of course we should always continue to do research. But it can be, I actually think it is very likely, that there is a limit that is naturally drawn by our senses and mental/intellectual powers (see ape example). And the explanations for many things we do not understand may lie beyond that boundary and therefore remain hidden from us forever.<br><br>Ich glaube wir muessen akzeptieren, dass wir Menschen keine perfekten Wesen sind und mit den uns gegebenen Sinnen und Intellekt/Geisteskraft womoeglich nicht alles erfassen bzw. wahrnehmen koennen, was da draussen ist. Vielleicht entspricht das, was wir wahrnehmen koennen, z.B. nur etwa 10% all dessen, was tatsaechlich existiert. Selbst die Instrumente, die wir entwickeln, um unsere Umwelt (einschl. des Universums) besser zu beobachten, messen und verstehen, sind Instrumente die auf Basis unserer Wahrnehmungsfaehigkeit entwickelt werden. Beispielsweise ist das komplexeste Instrument, das ein Affe entwickeln kann, ein einfacher Stock. Seine intellektuellen Kr\u00e4fte reichen nicht aus, um zu begreifen/zu verstehen, was hinter \u201eStock\u201c liegt.<br>Es kann also sein, dass wir bestimmte Dinge nie verstehen werden, weil wir sie nicht wahrnehmen/erfassen koennen. Kein Widerspruch hierzu ist, dass unsere Instrumente immer besser werden und wir unsere Umwelt immer besser verstehen. Und wir sollten natuerlich auch immer weiter Forschung betreiben. Aber es kann sein, ja ich halte es fuer sehr wahrscheinlich, dass es eine Grenze gibt, die durch unsere Sinne und Geisteskraft/Intellekt natuerlich gezogen ist.

However, you repeat a common myth about earlier cultures we call &quot;hunter gatherers,&quot; saying that they spent every waking hour seeking food and therefore were not free like us to do things like art. It took a Native American tribe here in California about two weeks to gather enough acorns to provide their staple food for an entire year. The hunters were a small class of folks in the typical tribe, so that labor was not done by most of the tribe. As for berries and other foods that supplemented the acorn flour staple, the people knew where these plants grew, and sometimes planted them in accessible places themselves, though in the natural landscape so they did not look like our agriculture. So gathering these was more akin to stepping into your yard and picking some tomatos for tonight&#39;s salad. Far from being &quot;primitive.&quot; indigenous, tribal cultures knew how to grow and access plant foods in a way that was sustainable and so in harmony with the natural landscape that the &quot;sophisticated and advanced&quot; Europeans couldn&#39;t even recognize them. And, by the way, that is why museums all over the world do not have enough space to display all of the art they have gathered that was, and still is, created by the tribal peoples. The majoirity of the plant foods we have in our diet we learned about from those &quot;hunter-gatherers.&quot; And they did it without thrashing the ecosystem. So who is the primitive?", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T01:51:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Boxmeyer", "comment_text": "Fertilizer is in the news now in Aug. 2022.

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

The vivid colors are due to (harmless) halophilic bacteria (or maybe they&#39;re actually archaea? I always forget) which thrive in the ultra-high salinity conditions where no other life can survive, and they use an array of bright pink and violet pigments to perform a type of photosynthesis without chlorophyll (at least if I&#39;m remembering correctly, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read up on this stuff, so feel free to correct me anyone). <br><br>The whole northern portion of the Great Salt is also pinkish-violet due to halophiles (it&#39;s functionally a separate lake from the southern portion nowadays due to the railroad causeway that was build cutting across the lake in the 1950s, which cut off the north part from the in-flow of the Jordan River, so there&#39;s more evaporation and the water has gained a way higher salt concentration than the south, leading to a different ecology with less brine shrimp and cyanobacteria and more halophiles). It&#39;s a pretty surreal and spectacular sight, albeit one that&#39;s arguably the result of reckless environmental tampering from humans.", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T05:42:41Z", "likes_count": 123}, {"comment_by": "N why?", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t need to watch.

Current agriculture just borrows resources from the future to support people now, assuming that technology will be invented that will make up the losses from erosion, lack of topsoil, and overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. That\u2019s not even mentioning most of the lost ecosystem services or beginning to address \u201canimal agriculture.\u201d<br><br>The video also does not address the health problems associated with potash and other forms of mining (including issues with the water table in the area), usually suffered by poorer communities and Native Americans (check out the continuing problems with abandoned uranium mines on Navajo land in New Mexico for an important Pin Drop story). <br><br>There is a huge amount of water waste that goes into recovering potash. The use of water from the Colorado River is so skewed that the water that once flowed all the way to Mexico is now a dry riverbed before it ever reaches the ocean. Climate change will cause the loss of about 5-20% more water from the Colorado, and a majority of the water is used to support agriculture that is not well-placed (given the tendency to drought recently).

Or to explore virtually anything, after all. Peasant communities tend to be quite conservative, you know - for a reason. You need all your time and energy just to sustain and survive - you have no resources for...silly experiments.<br><br>Yes, modern agriculture with all the machines, fertilizers and science is labor-effective way to get the food. But even the couple of centuries ago being peasant - i.e. for 95%+ of population - means hard monotonous work from sunset to dawn. Pre-modern agriculture is much, MUCH more labor-intensive way to get food if compared to hunting-gathering.<br><br>Reality is grim: key advantage of agriculture - pre-modern one, even ancient one - is that piece of land may support much bigger population if cultivated. Somewhat about tenfolds more peasants that hunters on the same area. Peasants has worse, grim, unpleasant and often shorter life filled with hard monotonous work and almost always with much more infant mortality rate.

Check this out.  Potash is used to make soap, which pioneers and farmers  used for a couple of centuries.  But Native American&#39;s also used potash.  Likely they discovered this by accident.  The would boil corn in clay pot over a fire.  But ashes falling into the water made the corn softer and easier to eat, so I suspect later this was done intentionally.   [This comes from The Cooking School website] Hominy comes from yellow or white maize, also known as field corn. Dried hominy kernels are soaked in an alkali solution of lye or slaked lime. This process, called nixtamalization, removes the hull and germ, making the corn easier to grind and cook with. Nixtamalization also helps the kernels release more of their nutrients, including niacin (also known as vitamin B3), and makes them easier to digest, too.<br><br>To stave off starvation during the Irish potato famine, corn was imported from the United States.  But the corn sent was &quot;field corn&quot; used as animal feed.  This might have been a great help, but the Irish did not have the knowledge of how to prepare the corn to make it edible.  <br><br>Side note:  The Irish potato famine resulted from a period of wet weather, which created ideal conditions for the plant fungal  disease called  phytopthora infastans, which devastated the potato crop.  This weather was experienced all over Europe, but the famine was limited to Ireland, because farmers in these other regions had access to many other food sources.<br><br>See &quot;Myths of  the Irish Potato Famine&quot;  An observer of the time, in 1846, wrote the following in a letter to the Primer Minister:<br><br>    For 46 years the people of Ireland have been feeding those of England with the choicest produce of their agriculture and pasture; and while they thus exported their wheat and their beef in profusion, their own food became gradually deteriorated\u2026until the mass of the peasantry was exclusively thrown on the potato.. . . It was impoverishment under British rule that caused so many Irish to be dependent on potatoes, not a silly decision to plant nothing but potatoes. A poor Irish family might have had as little as one-quarter acre of land on which to grow crops for export, raise a pig, and grow enough potatoes to keep from starving.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T05:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adan Buffkin", "comment_text": "So what ur saying is I can make gunpower(mostly)", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T02:28:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr Claudio M Bikich", "comment_text": "Thanks for such great productions.

I thought you were going there with your patent. And KCl as a fertilizer will carry along the chlorine which is a no-no on fields so how is it modified before application?

They probably had much more leisure time than modern workers. &quot;Sahlins argues that hunter-gatherer tribes are able to meet their needs through working roughly 15-20 hours per week or less.&quot; When challenged that he didn&#39;t include time spent processing and preparing food (and activities like gathering firewood; which is unrelated to the point you&#39;re making about fertilizer in this video), Sahlins&#39; estimate was revised up to ~44hrs/week for men and ~40hrs/week for women on all types of work, including housework and food prep. Modern workers spend AT LEAST 8hrs/day and 40hrs/week on their jobs alone; if you include housework tasks like cooking, cleaning, shopping, and errands, that expands to consume a vast portion of modern lives- much more than 8hrs/day or 40hrs/week.<br><br>While you still have a point that abundant agriculture can reduce time spent producing food from 3-5 to 0 hours per day, because a modern worker instead acquires food by earning money at a differentiated task, you make a very misleading statement in the process of making that point which could give viewers a very misguided view of a different scientific topic.<br><br>I loved learning about the main subject matter in this video, but I&#39;d appreciate it if the supporting statements for your main point weren&#39;t misleading!

And what happens when two positive charge come close to each other?  They repel each other.  Now, times that by billions of atoms that all repel each other at once and you get an explosion.  A coulomb explosion.  This is why all alkali metals below lithium explode on contact with water.  You can&#39;t get hydrogen to burn without oxygen, and you can get alkali metals to explode in an oxygen-less atmosphere.  Thunderfoot has a great video on this, as do I.  You can go to my channel and watch my sodium and potassium videos and see that they exode under water with no bubbles of hydrogen to burn.  You can also fill a balloon with hydrogen and set it on fire and it won&#39;t explode like in your video.  This is a very common misconception.   So I can&#39;t blame you for getting it wrong.  It&#39;s only been discovered in the last few years that alkali metals explode in water due to coulombs law and a coulomb explosion.

The only way to go in my opinion is a peaceful opioide drink and go to sleep. Never try to go with a stimulant or pills that might just make you puke and you&#39;ll think it was bleach in there. Death is there one thing in life that&#39;ll get you at the end, from being born in the hunting grounds of dinosaurs and snakes or a nice mansion, if you don&#39;t make sure it&#39;s nice for you at the end you&#39;ll probably wish more than anything at that moment that you had spent&#39;t your life better making sure you did and didn&#39;t fall yourself at the end, cruel and unthoughtful...

Storm clouds of higher charge send heat lightening and charge of higher electron charge move to clouds of lower electron charge to stabilize the electron balance in the atmosphere. We&#39;re energizing ground water tables with positive electron charge and telling storms not to come here, and with electron to magnetic earth ground charge a low depression stir where h20 reaches ground and which replenishes water like it should rarely happens, so it just evaps off, that&#39;s why lightening is more likely to hit the lone farm house rather than the neighborhood. With a fourth insulated conductor taking the returning current from each homes neutral bar back to the grid to power extra street lamps, etc, instead of energizing ground water tables which is a conductor, maybe the world will have more...

And with more jobs everywhere, everyone will have more for each other and dollars will go further everywhere. All the kids playing on dad&#39;s monopoly game will have a fun life and get back to serving one another. One kid will sell ice cream cones again because the other one is hired to paint houses, so he hires someone else to work on theirs, and people can build boats and people can go on boat rides again, with more people working more people can actually get a paid vacation and start saving for retirement (I&#39;ll take a retirement pll), but with everything shut down, it&#39;s a game of who wants to buy it all up for paper when it floods and collapses<br><br>Grow too much food so when the food truck is empty, it takes back the extra food with blemishes for fertilzer on indoor crops where there&#39;s no need for pestcde as there no bugs indoors, you can grow any crop with with above  or below ground (mirrored clay wall) vertical farms, magnifying glass panels at ground level, solar 24/7/365 growing seasons, indoor fresh water fish farms, indoor whaling, grow grass and put cows and chickens on it all year round (won&#39;t even stink up a metropolitan city in a high rise) plant dirt and grass and cows where torn down factories left concrete waste slabs) in a building grass can be grown in many floor to ceiling returnable plats on a conveyer, that&#39;s takes it up to the dairy floors for food where the cows eat it at 3&#39; above the floor, the floor has a squeegee system and the cows are herded from one half of the floor to the other for cleaning: an automated squeege cleans the floor and empties it into a special for drain: the cow manure goes back down in a pipe for fertilizer : ) the floor has a floor washer, like a car wash, but with clean spayed water on the floor and a squeegee system : ) So good<br><br> Salt water can be separated with oxygen being released like a rain forest to the outside air while the electricity generated disinfects waste water as it makes energy (NASA does this to make cabin oxygen while it releases everything else to space) Everyone uses a small steam distiller to disinfect and remove salt at the sink for drinking and cooking, everyone gets soft water to their house from the ocean, (already has natural salt in it) drag pipelines to every continent, more jobs, and divert river system maybe to deserts to take sea water rise from melting ice caps and maybe restock what used to be an ocean, natural sand filter at least, just don&#39;t put sharks in there and you can surf : )<br><br> NASA uses electrolysis to make cabin oxygen from water and they release the hydrogen gas to outer space, you could use the h as clean energy and release the oxygen to the planet as a rain forest, drag ocean soft water to municipalities, they use a small steam distiller at the sink for drinking water, everyone&#39;s off toilet to tap, and you use electrolysis to disinfect the waste water and make energy. You split the ocean stream for indoor fresh water and salt water fish farming. You build or convert 40 story buildings for indoor farming. Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there&#39;s solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320. You grow too much food so the empty good truck picks up the blemished felt and vegetables for fertilizer. You can have a cow floor, a dairy farm and a chicken floor in what was an office building. One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work. Now they both work from home, they can get paid more and write off an office in their home, empty office building can be converted to indoor farms, and the sprinkler system can be used for irrigation. You can grow every crop in the world, everywhere, indoor, with every climate and 24/7/365 agriculture, and not even smell farm animals in a building <br><br>For what it costs to build housing here and grow food on welfare, we can pay people who want to go to another country and build indoor farms and drag ocean lines and build clean energy waste water stations. Who wants to get paid to go to south America and maybe even live there?

It said that the amount of hours spent &quot;sustaining ourselves&quot;, eg. gathering, farming or today working was the lowest during the hunter-gathering phase, where we supposedly only spent a couple to a handful of hours each day, leaving the most time for creative activities, socializing etc. Then farming came along and &quot;won out&quot; because it was so much more scalable and reliable, but on average <b>increased</b> the daily workload of humans massively. Today, most industrialized nations where people work 40 hour a week land somewhere in between. You mentioned that hunter-gatherers spent &quot;all day every day&quot; searching for food, and I wonder if any research was made to back up that statement or if it slipped through as something that &quot;seems plausible&quot;.

Those are issues that go beyond the story of potash, of course, but addressing them directly is called for because Derek&#39;s old school history about the development of the arts and sciences is mystifying. Agricultural societies do not free up people&#39;s time to follow artistic or scientific pursuits. On the contrary, more people toil than ever to produce food to sustain life and more of people&#39;s time than ever must be devoted to achieving a viable subsistence (in early agricultural societies) or to gain a wage/income (in our world) that is sufficient for a life without deprivation. Hunter-gatherer societies qualify as the original affluent society (Marshall Sahlins) in which all the people&#39;s wants were fairly easily satisfied.<br><br>There is also a misjudgement about how art and science figure in societies at large. &#39;Free time&#39; isn&#39;t the driving force behind the development of art and science even if curiosity (and the boundlessness of curiosity) is indeed very much at play. But, the paths followed by a curious mind are always conditioned by the prevailing needs within particular forms of life. Fortunately for us, a curious mind will also be very attuned to features of our world and our form of life that act as ostacles to the satisfaction of our needs.

Also, there is plenty of scientific evidence nowadays about the disastrous impact of gliphosate and other chemics for our health (cancer mainly), which are only prohibited in Europe.

Hunter-Gatherers despite popular narratives only needed to spend roughly 16-24 hours per week foraging for food (depending upon geographic location, resource availability, etc). Humans with the advent of agriculture continually destroyed the edible biodiversity on earth, eradicating hundreds of botanicals and vegetables which thousands of years ago would have provided swifter access to a diverse food repertoire, further offering varied vitamins and nutrients. Notice now how people are abandoning monoculture farming (ie: the classic American corn breadbasket), and trying to go back to polyculture farming and harvesting. Perhaps there are applications in using potassium fertilizer in these polyculture-style farming regions, but we already know they are unnecessary, as polyculture farming on its own helps to mitigate pests and offers greater sustainable productivity.

Agriculture indeed supports more people than hunter/gathering does, but with a poorer diet we have not yet been able to evolutionarily adjust to. One theory suggests that agriculture developed not as a way to feed more people, but as a way to allow some people to accumulate wealth and power by taking a portion of what the others produce.

Humans and our findings are inefficient, for we have and are destroying and have been destroying the biodiversity of the life here, with our farming. And if anything automating life only takes away our purpose, instead more people arise, by the billions, and more are destine to work for a tiny variety of food ingedients, that they have little choice but to accord, for they will starve if they do not buy from the coglomerate seed companies produce supermarket sellers. All the while thrust into a system that doesnt just take away from life but removes the definition. We have evolved like all organisms here with our planet - there is no other home for us. But there is this goal, this fight to escape from our destine fate - death. There has to be more... more... more. For all of our history, we have had everything we need. And anything else just takes a way from the fundamental nature of life. We are stuck here, and a bunch of you think this is good. The soil erodes with industrial farming practice. Most of the neccessary soil animals simply cannot exist, and so they cannot do what do best breaking down, converting this into that, and building healthy soil molecules, with miles of surface area, porosity. In one tea spoon of soil, and not of any industrial farm, apparently has more organisms in it that there humans here. What is the point of getting even better at farming, when we already have too many people? Surely the math serves rather obviously: food + people - predator - illness = more people. More people + food - predator - illness =? Even more people + more food - predators - more illnesses = I wonder what the answer could be. Perhaps it works? Here is another for ya people = less biodiversity. more people = even less biodiversity. And so on... Organisms that have been here for 100s of thousands of years if not, millions of years are dying faster in the last 30 years than I imagine in of all human history certainly far exceeding human civilization. And we are suggesting possium mining is good for the planet - good for people? There is nothing  to do besides eating, shitting, procreating, and dying? everthing else is to help these four things fundamentally, and anything besides this you are designing a house? making this making that, better this better that. longer life. But truly there is nothing more to life than your fundamental capacity to live, and the bodily functions accordingly. We are entirely reliant on external food minerals etc. And are thus symbiotic in the system. But we are so egotistical that we remove ourselves from the animal kingdom as if we are more, suggesting we are not animals where possible because technology has evolved, a technology that has only made it easier for us to grow in population, only made it easier to impose on the natural world, and interfere with the fundamental delicacy of the systems of life. Only made it easier and more effective the abilty to cut down forests, to poach. What ever we do, there 7.8 billion people, and as an idividual you can do a lot of harm, imagine what 10,000 could do, imagine 10,000 all huddled up together. I don&#39;t think even 10,000 gorillas exist, nevermind 7.8 billion. How many species could we put together of mammals, as many as possible in diversity could exist and still not exceed our number with just one single species? And we have not the capacity to understand, never mind the capacity to respect life, for most are scared of spiders, and many dust. Why even exist at all when you denounce life, something that you are, they are our kin, they are earthlings. But no we are the top of the food chain they say, we are above life itself, and we are going to explore those empty space rocks and live there where there are no birds to be heard, and no home for us. Sure our goal is to live forevor, and to develop technologies to be able to travel through time and to different planets with life, etc. We have dreams - because reality is distasteful. it does not satisfy. dying is probably the most influential idea in our history, and it is this that propells us with our advances. But I say it is pointless. Even if you should find immortality eventually your home, eventually the universe will decay. And more importantly why does any of this exist at all? Maybe they will stop dreaming, but there are already too many. You are probably one of them. Bunch of idiots - I mean it with the greatest sympathy. But we are all just autonotoms. Hopefully we catch a break and it works out, for we only have this one life, and so far considering human history, I am feeling imensely unlucky, a place I suppose is shared by us all, par from you blissful ignorant folk.", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T05:10:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brendon Miratana", "comment_text": "Brilliant", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T05:09:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pika pool", "comment_text": "i love these iam subcribing just discovered  today", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T04:51:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austin Russell", "comment_text": "You can see them really well from the overview at Dead Horse Point.", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T04:27:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis Bickle", "comment_text": "Production is next level on this one", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T03:50:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryan Rebleza", "comment_text": "Very informative, good job YouTube !

Thought it was for extraction of rare element salts which are differently soluble in water and precipitate at different concentrations. So the algae growing in there give the colour of water depending on species of halophilic algae or archaea or brine shrimp which change depending on the elements present in that water. Btw. Extraction of potassium is better done from the sea as it contains about 10 percent of dry salt.

But, I agree with the other commenters concerned about the \u201ccorporate\u201d feel seeping in to this channel.  It\u2019s becoming clear that the creative content creators that made YouTube great are now being targeted and \u201ccontrolled\u201d by corporate interests or \u201ccloned\u201d and counterfeited by corporate knockoffs.  For example, I saw one corporate YouTube channel about hunting for gold nuggets that featured young Asian females in bikinis standing knee deep in a creek with stainless steel fine meshed kitchen strainers allegedly finding large golf ball sized gold nuggets with ease.  The location was reported as an undisclosed island in a war torn third world country.  It was clear to me that these nuggets were just rocks spray painted with gold colored paint.  The underlying corporate messaging was clear.  \u201cGold is expensive because it\u2019s found only in remote areas of the world plagued by war.  But, you can come to YouTube and watch young girls in bikinis find it with ease in a creek as corporate created content.  The channel had over 70,000 subscribers!  That kind of idiotic content is the future business model for YouTube.

It&#39;s a total waste in fact. The county only allowed a potash factory to be installed there because the local economy was based on uranium mining and milling, an industry which had just collapsed when the US gov&#39;t suddenly stopped purchasing uranium. So the locals were desperate to keep destroying their own landscape for money. This is what you get. Guess what? If this mine/factory didn&#39;t exist, it wouldn&#39;t affect the price of potash in the world at all, there wouldn&#39;t be any shortages, and in fact this factory produces potash at such an uneconomical rate, it&#39;s far cheaper to obtain from other places and other mines. Nowadays This factory makes and sells salt. Which, yeah, also not worth the impact. Since there&#39;s a whole lake full of salt a hundred miles away with no evaporation ponds necessary, or rather it&#39;s a big natural evaporation pond. Also potash is not really as important to industrial agriculture as nitrogen, that&#39; pretty overstated that these evaporation ponds serve any useful or functional purpose beyond making money for the people who own them.

Science has produced a huge number of ways for a few to profit, but many of those benefits do not reach those who really need them.<br><br>I really wish we lived in the utopia a lot of science communicators present, but sadly Covid has only re-confirmed for many of us that the distribution of necessities is highly imperfect and no amount of science advancement for &quot;billions&quot; in profit, changes that. Last week we got a call from a holocaust survivor in our community, who has a broken wrist and had no food in the house and we used our connections within food saving groups to help her out - no amount of science tech gives her freedom, as even before Covid her options for food were limited by inequality of financial means, social mobility and a lack of free elder care that means support relies on volunteers or being able to afford to pay for a carer. Distribution and assistance via volunteers is tough, too - we maintain our own vehicles to do so, most of which are from two plus decades ago and do not benefit from the advancements in modern, expensive vehicles.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, this is a rant that&#39;s gone rather off topic, but the overly optimistic and unbalanced nature of the close really got to me and I had to vent, regardless whether this comment will ever be read...

Dr. Derek Muller, I have a question for you, which you might want to pursue and help give us answers to. I have studied agriculture and understand the importance of Potassium; it&#39;s one of the 3 major macro-nutrients included in virtually every type of fertilizer. Access to isolated nutrients changed the game completely... and now I know how Potassium was discovered and isolated to begin with (thank you). But every type of fertilizer refers to it&#39;s &quot;NPK values&quot; \u2013 the ratio percentage of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorpus (P) and Potassium (K) within the fertilizer itself. These 3 nutrients benefit different aspects of a plant&#39;s growth (and the balance between them is vital). So, now my questions is &quot;How about Nitrogen and Phosphorous? How were they discovered and isolated?&quot; Can you explore this and the historical impact these discoveries had? As an agriculture specialist I think it&#39;s funny to think they started spreading tonnes of Potassium across fields, completely oblivious about the other two macro-nutrients and virtually throwing the soils nutrient content way off balance. I mean, it&#39;s the very balance between the three which is so key to producing good results to begin with. So what about Nitrogen and Phosphorous?", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T12:00:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cody Lavis", "comment_text": "thank you for teaching me how to make a bomb without the FBI knocking on my door.", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T11:58:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Kavanagh", "comment_text": "Lol the Chinese own the potash mines in Canada \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6.

I&#39;m not sure if you have to keep it that way in order to compete with other popular programs, but personally, I&#39;m finding it more difficult to immerse in the informative content this way.

It&#39;s like I watched a whole bunch of stuff kind of rush by but haven&#39;t really had the chance to let it sink in or appreciate the setups, the camera shots, the information provided and so on.

I think it&#39;s likely that it&#39;s pumped up from the ground. Those pools are clearly evaporation ponds, exposing as much surface to the sun as possible with the goal of letting the water evaporate. So there&#39;s probably something in the water that is being extracted here. My first guess would be Lithium, but I&#39;ve never heard of a Lithium mine in Utah, or anywhere in the USA. So what else could it be? I&#39;m going out on a Limb here, as I now very little about Chemistry, but let&#39;s have a look at the elements close to Lithium in the periodic table. Especially those in the same row. Natrium and Potassium come to mind. Natrium Chloride is Salt and mined in basically the same way that we see here. But that&#39;s also nothing special and happens all over the world. I have no idea if Potassium can be mined the same way as Lithium and Natrium, but I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume. Also Potassium is enormously  important as a fertilizer in agriculture. It&#39;s basically what made modern agriculture possible and allowed the immense population growth of the last century.

What I don&#39;t get is why it has to be so over the top with the cinematographic and so under with the science and so dramatic and all over the place to make links with things that have no importance, have no sense like the Washington&#39;s signature or the gas explotion in mines. One of the most deep investigations about the potasium reaction with water that I know, and I really love, it&#39;s from Thunderfoot and it&#39;s really amazing how good it is even if the &quot;image quality&quot; or &quot;the production value&quot; is not the same as this video. This is why I left the mainstream media to look for other alternatives that the content, not the esthetics, is more important but more and more YouTube creators are heading to a really low quality content but high production value and filmography or just pure drama and a huge amount of sponsors and merch... I understand that this kind of production involves a lot effort and resources but I really wonder if those things are made in the name of the content or are really just for the sake of it, for the sake of the views and the vicious circle of more views equals more money, equals more production a greater videos but the core is lost cause in this kind of &quot;canned&quot; productions a lot of things are stripped out in favor of others things that not always work with the content and in others really is against. Like over the top music to enlarge some shot that really laks mening and could be copletely let out. Or completely manufactured scenes where some art director said that &quot;.. put behind the camera and act as if you are the one taking the shot...&quot;, I imagine they said, but in the next shot you not even know how to replay the footage...\r<br>\r<br>I feel like I lost time watching it and I don&#39;t get anything aside of a shallow content with over the top image, production and filmography.

We do not need to add all the fertilizer to the land. Yes it will make plants green and grow but there are much better methods of growing our food that actually helps the land and does not polute our water. They way we grow the majority of crops is destroying the soil.  When you add all this fertilizer it henders and even kills the beneficial microbes that give the plants nutrients. Many nutrients, that our diet is so poor in now. Not to mention that fertilizer is used on monocrops because this is not how nature grows so they have to add things to the soil to get any results. Then you have more pest and weeds come up so they then try and kill these while killing all beneficial organizims and poisons our food. Not to mention all the run off that gets into water ways kills life there all the way to the ocean where it destorys the ecosystem. Causing blooms of sometimes harmful alge and getting into the fish we eat.   And none of it is nessecary!! It is just what corporations want everyone to believe because thats how they make there billions. Most monocrops are also grown using tillage which leaves the soil bare, causing tons of topsoil to get blow away every year and desturbs all the beneficial micro systems causing them to die.  We must change the way we grow our food. It can not continue the way it is, it is just not sustanible.  We need regenerative methods, these are proven to actually increase yleld, provide divirsity, and increase the amount of topsoil and its water absorbtion. This cuts down on the need to irigate and also decreases flooding.  Don&#39;t believe propaganda like this.  Learn more about regenerative farming methods.

Quick correct for the end though: moving from hunter-gathering lifestyles to agriculture did not free up time for prehistoric humans. In fact, the adoption of the new lifestyle made them work longer and harder and caused malnutrition for many generations. Why? Well, hunter-gatherers spend some of their time gathering for a diverse array of food. When they succeed at a hunt, that&#39;ll typically feed the group for a while. This lifestyle doesnt feed a dense population groups are small. Modern anthropologists confirm that surviving hunter gatherers today do indeed have shorter work days than farmers did. <br>The new lifestyle was successful because it produced societies that had inherent advantages over their neigbours: they produced more food, which means they were more numerous and could expand - thus the lifestyle expanded. Famines tended to affect these societies more though, as they couldnt just move to a different area, as quickly all areas of food producers were filled with people, as densely packed as normal non-famine condition farming would allow. Furthermore, farmers had less food diversity in their diet than hunter gatherers, who collected from many availably sources of a large area. Food producers concentrated their efforts and all their time on the limited stuff they could produce.<br>Yes, that lifestyle also allowed for specialists to arise: with a much larger production, some members of society could specialize and become non-food generating leaders, priests and artisans. It&#39;s part of how sedantary food producer societies developped larger collectives, tribes and eventually what we call civilisation.<br>Only recently has the farming lifestyle become one that the individuals benefit from fully. Nowadays, we reap the rewards for which pretty much 10.000 years of ancestors of food producers lead a shorter, less easy life than they could have as hunter-gatherers (who, evidence shows, were taller and healthier on average than similar food producers)...<br><br>Just to clarify for anyone that reads this to the end: in no means should the length of the comment make this a criticism of the show as a whole.

One exception: Kaolinite surface mines (of which there are plenty around here) - these are pretty amazing up close and personal, not to mention pretty photogenic (all the colors of the layers! It feels like the surface of Mars or something), too (just don&#39;t tell on me, because these are off-limits, but that hasn&#39;t stop me!)... You see, there&#39;s almost always water involved in these (the whole process of &quot;washing&quot; the kaolin clay is pretty interesting, but too long to describe, and to be honest, I don&#39;t understand it well quite yet, but it&#39;s a &quot;density&quot; thing, some things float, some things sink, you know all that), and the water is (you probably guessed it) blue! Or at least appears to be blue (reflects the sky).

Not only are potassium gradients and their conduction across transmembrane ion channels critical to the dynamics of electrical impulses (action potentials) of neurons, they also establish more complex neural network properties that generate oscillatory rhythmic patterns of activity (known as central pattern generators) to orchestrate our heart beat, respiration, locomotion, and state-dependent gating of different modalities of information processing to and from specific circuits across the brain.

And there&#39;s no reason to believe ancient hunter-gatherers did. Only a few hours a day actually. The rest of the time is spent doing other things, though. <br><br>And there&#39;s no reason people couldn&#39;t have specialized, with some spending all day hunting while others spent all day making arrows, or processing leather, or weaving baskets, pottery, etc. So specialization isn&#39;t the power of agriculture. <br><br>It&#39;s actually just productivity within an area. People don&#39;t want to commute more than half an hour each way, which is true today and was true historically based on the distances between and areas of control of ancient villages and the sizes of towns. So a particular area of land has a certain amount of productivity as a wild space where wild animals and fruit grow. But grasslands and pastures can be made far more productive for humans by herding grazing animals. Forest can be made to produce more food if you cut down most of the trees, clear the land, and plant crops. Not only does this technology improve the amount of food one person can produce per year, it improves how much food can be wrested from a particular acre per year. <br><br>Agriculture, while not required for specialization to occur, instead all but demands it. When all the land in a given area of control of a village is being worked optimally, there will be population growth, and any extra people will be idle. Typically they will then turn to some other way of supporting themselves, trading their work product for food. Specialization improves productivity of each person. And by demanding specialization, agriculture is an impetus for that. <br><br>Settling down instead of being nomadic results in other developments like the concept of property rights, regulation of the day, cultural reinforcement. This encourages improvement of a particular owned region by its inhabitants: dwellings, industry, fortifications, civic structures, roads. Nomads don&#39;t care about this stuff. And here we&#39;ll see soil fertility improvement through soil amendments like potash and manure. Without agriculture people are just far less likely to settle down and do these things. But these developments improve the resilience of the community and begin to build civilization. <br><br>Perhaps as a consequence of agriculture, but perhaps a driver of agriculture, domestication of animals and plants makes them more useful; bearing more fruit, tolerant of drought and pests, extending their growing seasons, making processing easier by reducing chaff, making them tastier or less poisonous, increasing their durability. Long-term storage of grains, pulses, legumes, etc. is foundational to long-term survivability and economy. <br><br>So there are many reasons why agriculture was a vital step for hunter-gatherer societies. But they would (and did) carry on just fine until each was inevitably crushed underfoot by an agrarian-to-industrial society.", "comment_date": "2021-01-29T05:25:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MayurPatel", "comment_text": "very insightful and thoughtful video and the the channel of course, thank you Derek for this one", "comment_date": "2021-01-29T05:23:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Caithness", "comment_text": "Where can someone get their hands on that potassium?

He definitely liked big explosions in every way.  When I took his class, everything was set up and ready to go just like the years and years before, except that time, when he released the bundled up potassium, he tripped over his own feet and hit the barrel of water.  Basically, instead of the explosion going straight up like the video here, it ended up blowing out sideways, which took out a huge window.  The whole damn school had to be evacuated, if I remember correctly he was my first class so the time would be around 8am, mid-November and just pouring rain.  The weather only got worse, and we couldn&#39;t enter the building until the Fire Department cleared everything, so the teachers called over to the transportation room in the elementary school and asked them to start and open the busses.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..<br><br>Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed..

However, it could have been interesting to open on a less oriented point of view on Potassium.<br>It indeed is the root of many good things that &quot;free&quot; humanity from the burden of finding food. But our society today is completely altering the benefits, by its over exploitation. Firstly, as of it is produced today, it creates a lot of local pollution, and is sometime a big health problem for local communities. Potassium in the soils are finite, and deforestation (second way of production) is also a major problem for biodiversity. Secondly, it is mostly used in monocultural fields, which are one of the roots of the problem of soils defertilization (which potassium helps to combat). However, other agricultural techniques as permaculture or sylviculture (forestry in english i think), respect way more the natural harmony between plants, with less fertilizers added, and same productivity rate. Potassium has been a launching pad for humanity (as coal or petrol).

I did not know the story behind the association of actual pot ashes with potassium but now I have something new to share in my presentations.  :)", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T15:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arnisvitols", "comment_text": "Congrats so much for joining youtube originals team :)<br>This is high quality and value video.<br>Happy to see this and cant wait for next.", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T15:19:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u262f\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc18\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc2d\u262f", "comment_text": "The Sheep and the Goats\r<br>Jesus Christ Said:\r<br>31 \u201cWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.\r<br>34 \u201cThen the King will say to those on his right, \u2018Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\u2019\r<br>37 \u201cThen the righteous will answer him, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?\u2019\r<br>40 \u201cThe King will reply, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u2019\r<br>41 \u201cThen he will say to those on his left, \u2018Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\u2019\r<br>44 \u201cThey also will answer, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?\u2019\r<br>45 \u201cHe will reply, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\u2019\r<br>46 \u201cThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T15:19:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juen", "comment_text": "Great Topics and story but sadly production and editing are not good.

This narrative of our ancestors is now somewhat put into question by scholars such as James C Scott. It is not obvious that agriculture in proto-states was an overall positive for those practicing it (due to the high labor cost and lesser resilience it entailed for people who relied before on a variety of food sources). The reasons for certain people to even use agriculture in the first place are actually quite difficult to understand; these reasons might range from change in climate, location and type of nearby bodies, local abundance of food and even political regimes. Agriculture is by no mean a clear-cut progress for any type of society. I believe people such as Derek, who have an ever growing audience and public visibility, should pay a lot of attention to the narrative they push, especially when not doing the research it should entail (as scientific deontology prescribes). The narrative of technological progress as being absolute, disconnected from the reality of societies in which scientific and technological leap actually occurs, is now quite dated and should not (in my humble opinion) be propagated anymore.", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T12:16:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allampati Subbaratnamma", "comment_text": "But,all resources will be overed?", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T12:13:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sammy Rovalino", "comment_text": "Amazing production Quality", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T12:11:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Yazdan", "comment_text": "You deserve every single cent you earn from YouTube \ud83d\udc4f", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T12:11:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aniruddha Chakraborty", "comment_text": "How is the linear momentum conserver in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMDJA4UvXLA&amp;t=4m50s\">4:50</a>?", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T12:11:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elijs Dima", "comment_text": "Comment for the algorith, the title &quot;These Ponds Help Support Half The People On Earth&quot; got me to watch this vid.", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T12:11:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "gaurav oswal", "comment_text": "Its a great show .

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..<br><br>Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed..

For me, this video was considerably less informative than most of your other videos.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<br>[15]Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<br>[16]Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br>[17]Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>[18]For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br>[19]Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>[20]For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>[21]Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<br>[22]But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.<br>[23]Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br>[24]Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br>[25]Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.<br>[26]Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.<br>[27]Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:<br>[28]But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.<br>[29]And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br>[30]And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br>[31]It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:<br>[32]But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.<br>[33]Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:<br>[34]But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God&#39;s throne:<br>[35]Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.<br>[36]Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<br>[37]But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.<br>[38]Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<br>[39]But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br>[40]And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.<br>[41]And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.<br>[42]Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.<br>[43]Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<br>[44]But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>[45]That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<br>[46]For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?<br>[47]And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?<br>[48]Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.,,", "comment_date": "2021-01-27T23:59:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Major Tom", "comment_text": "here comes youtube originals to destroy another of the channels i like.

Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous.

In 2005 they drilled a set of interconnected horizontal boreholes through the potash bearing strata using the same tech used for horizontal oil and gas drilling. A small point of clarification, but the majority of the evap ponds are actually sodium chloride and the KCL is separated in the plant a few miles east via an amine bubbling process. The remaining sodium saturated water is actually recycled back down the pump shafts. KCL is preferentially soluble in water and this keeps the sodium byproduct from building up.

Most of the things that I really like about a regular Veritasium videos--namely how they respect the intelligence and attention span of the viewer--aren&#39;t present. This new show is way overproduced, way too loud, and gimicky in such a pandering, intelligence insulting way. Which is a shame, because I think the content of this episode is really interesting. I realize you might not have a ton of creative control on this project and I also know that you&#39;d be a fool to pass up on a youtube original (totally get that) but please don&#39;t feel like you have to reinvent the wheel to grow your channel in the future. The things that drew me to your channel (and probably a ton of people like me) wasn&#39;t the production value or the scale, but rather how you tackle interesting topics in a straightforward, yet laymen friendly manner.

Actually they worked less than the average person in industrialized societies, at least according to the best knowledge available in anthropology. In his book &quot;Work&quot;, James Suzman talks about the relationship that hunter-gatherers had with work. His main object of study, the Ju/&#39;Hoansi, worked an average of 17h/week looking for food in the Kalahari Desert plus 20h/week in domestic work. And this is mostly true for all living hunter-gatherers societies. Most people in the &quot;developed&quot;/developing world work 40-44h (not even counting domestic work), that is waay more than the time we used to work back then. Probably most of people in hunter-gatherer societies had more time to engage in cultural activities such as creating art and music, and spending time with their family and friends.
