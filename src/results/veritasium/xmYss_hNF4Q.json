That type of structural rim seems to be pretty vital as i believe it held the top and bottom of the sides at its original width. This (I think) then meant that the sides were held further apart and it therefore couldn&#39;t achieve the equilateral triangle the huge drum achieved. I would think that if you got a taller barrel but kept the same structural design and diameter, it would crush itself into an equilateral shape like the big barrel.\u00a0@Veritasium\u00a0I challenge you to test my hypothesis.
