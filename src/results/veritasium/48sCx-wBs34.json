Once the earth is snow cold, it means that there is temporarily nothing keeping deep space cold increase velocity from us but more planetary space. The cold has been radiating since the beginning of time and we still haven&#39;t frozen. The earth is much more enormous than we were taught; since snowflakes are otherwise possible.

The reason for both of these ideas are intimately intertwined, and are shockingly purely arithmetic consequence of a simple geometric formula.<br><br>According to the Euler characteristic, for any polyhedron the number of vertexes minus the number of edges plus the number of faces is equal to 2. For example, a cube has 8 verticies, 12 edges, and 6 faces, and 8-12+6 is 2.  Also, note that for any polyhedron each face must have 3 or more edges, and 3 or more edges have to meet at every vertex.  This point is really obvious if you try to build a 3d shape with 2 edges to a face or 2 edges to a vertex-- it just doesn&#39;t work.<br><br>Let&#39;s say you have a regular polyhedra with p edges per face, and q edges per vertice. In this case because every edge is shared by exactly 2 faces, and every edge is shared by exactly 2 vertices, pf=2e and qv=2e. If this is confusing, imagine a cube. A cube has 6 faces, and every face has 4 edges. But because every edge borders two faces, it has (6*4)/2=12 edges.  The same math applies to the vertices.<br><br>You can rearrange the above to get f=(2e)/p and v=(2e)/q. But because of Euler&#39;s characteristic of polyhedrons, v-e+f=2. Simple substitution yields (2e/q)-e+(2e/p)=2. If you divide the previous equation by 2e and rearrange, you get (1/p) + (1/q) = (1/2) + (1/e). Now, if each face has 6 edges or more, it means that p \u2265  6, which means that q \u2264 3. However, that means that each vertex would have 2 or less edges, which is impossible. Thus p&lt;6.  And because each face must have at least 3 edges, p\u22653, each face of a regular polyhedra must have exactly 3, 4, or 5 edges. For similar reasons, 3\u2264q&lt;6, so each vertex of a regular polyhera must have exactly 3, 4, or 5 edges meeting at it. Checking these numbers against the formula shows that there are only 5 combinations of &quot;edges per face&quot; and &quot;edges per vertex&quot; that give a number greater than 1/2, which will be exactly the 5 regular polyhedra.<br><br>Now, that&#39;s cool. But what if we had a polyhedron with somehow an infinite number of edges? In this case, because e is infinite, 1/e becomes zero, and you&#39;re left with (1/p) + (1/q) = 1/2.<br><br>In this case, there are 3 possible answers. You can have {p,q}= {3,6}, {4,4}, or {6,3}. Let&#39;s take a look at p=3, q=6. In this case, it means that there are 3 edges per face, and 6 edges per vertex. The only way to draw this is to have 6 triangles around every vertex. And.... if you put 6 triangles around a single vertex, then the entire thing flattens out and the triangles tile the plane, creating your infinite number of edges. Similarly, {4,4} gives a plane of squares and {6,3} gives a plane of hexagons.

You can see, how the quality dips down, as the algorithm struggles to keep the number of refreshed areas to a minimum, but the picture is just too much noise, to keep a good quality, at the given bitrate.<br><br>As an (shortened) explanation for those who do not know: Modern video codecs obviously are trying to keep the size of a video-file down. One way they do this, is by cutting the image into tiles, which is funny, given the topic of this video. <br>The algorithm then looks at these little pieces and compares the current frame with the next one. If a tile matches...or closely matches the one at the same position in the next frame, then only a reference to that tile is saved, which takes up less space. So one tile is then effectively used twice, because they didn\u2019t change between frames.<br>The more you compress a movie, the more it tries to find matching tiles and the \u201eloser\u201c the rules for \u201eWhat is matching?\u201c get. That also means, that the quality gets worse, because the tiles get matched with others, that aren\u2018t QUITE the same and at one point, our eyes notice.<br>The desired file (to be exact the bitrate) size then dictates the number of original/true tiles can be saved, compared to just a reference.<br><br>What does that mean in this context?<br>Well 1, a compressing algorithm LOVES videos, that display the same thing, over and over again, because that means a lot of same-y tiles.<br>And 2, the more the picture changes, the more original tiles must be saved. However we just established, that this number is finite. Not only is it finite, the algorithm has to spread each tile evenly, it cannot spend every tile in the first second, because then there is nothing left for the rest. That rate, in which the tiles are \u201espent\u201c is basically, what the bitrate is.<br>Number 3: Knowing that, we also know, that the bitrate is also finite, which means, if the number of changed tiles per frame exceeds the number of tiles the algorithm can spend, it is forced to widen the rules (remember the size and bitrate cannot be increased), as described above, which leads to a blurry video, the higher that difference is.<br><br>That noise he created CONSTANTLY changes and quickly spends our tile-budget and that is why it starts looking blurry.<br><br>Why am i writing this?

All descriptions that talk about a multiverse in a &quot;scientific&quot; fashion seem to assume that the basic, rock-bottom laws of physics that occurs in OUR universe also occurs in those others, such as the many possible variations in string theory or the Everett Concept for Quantum Mechanics.  These are MUCH too conservative.  If there can be one &quot;Big Bang&quot; (or however the universe we know initially came into existence), even if it is at the far end of a chain of previous &quot;bangs&quot; (Eternal Inflation concept or Penrose&#39;s concept of a cyclic universe or some such alternative), there is no reason at all that there would not be an infinite number (what would limit it?) of other bangs or burps or whatever you may call them, creating things that would mostly be totally inconceivable to us in every way, since they started with nothing to do with our universe in any way whatsoever.  They would be totally inconceivable to each other, too, if some sort of intelligence existed in any of them.  The term &quot;multiverse&quot; is not big enough:  I use a shorthand term for these &quot;infinite multiverses of multiverses&quot; as the &quot;omniverse&quot;.  I assume that it has NO RULES WHATSOEVER, creating what in our universe is the &quot;quantum foam&quot; verified by the Cassimere Effect, but here the &quot;foam&quot; are entire universes with entirely different rules and concepts that we cannot sense or describe in any way whatsoever.

That is known as the Infinite Monkey theorem. However, if we assume it takes the monkey an infinite amount of time, then to do it twice it would take two infinite amounts of time. However, adding something to infinity will make it equal infinity because it <b>is</b> infinity. So that means the immortal monkey will type all of Shakespeare\u2019s works in order an infinite amount of times. That\u2019s like this and like pi: If given an infinite number like pi, the number 3 will repeat an infinite number of times. 314 will repeat an infinite number of times. 31415926535 will repeat an infinite number of times. Pi will repeat an infinite number of times inside the digits because it is an infinite number. That means that the infinite pattern will repeat an infinite number of times within itself just due to it being infinite. <br><br>However, I\u2019m sure I made a wrongful assumption somewhere and that\u2019s why I\u2019m commenting.

I know some of you who are yet to try it are still doubtful about Facebook as a platform but from my point of you the growth levels and potential is nuts compared to YT/Twitch. YT is for videos which is why if you look at the difference between YT and Twitch streams the difference graphically in quality is insane. FB is somehow even better than Twitch. YT streams apart from a few of the bigger names anyone literally people streaming on potatoes with like 100 subs are viewbotting to like 10k viewers and its just dumb so that is why I don&#39;t want to stream on YT On top of the fact that graphically its poor and it massively effects video views streaming and uploading on YT. Twitch however I cant fault. I loved Twitch. The reason ive moved away from that is because it is insanely cliquey. Meaning if you either arent in with the big guns orrrrrr you don&#39;t have insane growth on YT to bring people across to Twitch then you will struggle. MY Twitch was doing fantastic on Blackout but that isn&#39;t going to help in the long run vs new CODs. I would massively encourage you guys to try FB It is realistically the exact same as twitch. I do not use FB Social media. I don&#39;t like or care for it. Facebook Gaming is totally separate. It has its own gaming app separately to the social media platform just like Twitch which is accessible from both iphone and android stores. The community is older meaning less stupid children trolling which YT is full of... I literally don&#39;&#39;t even have mods on Facebook. I needed them on every other platform. View wise over the last week just on streams alone ive had roughly 600k views on Facebook. Which is more than i would have had on both YT and Twitch. I will be really trying to concentrate on getting a regular video schedule for you guys on YT. Especially in time for Cold War! I&#39;ve invested heavily in equipment and the quality of what will be coming from me going forward will be insane. I&#39;ve had alot of comments about how good the stream is looking recently too so trust me when I say that I will be putting everything in to making sure the Siimssyy Fam achieves everything it can do going forward and COLD War we will be going huge! Big content new series for videos challenges blah blah blah we will be trying to bring original content and ideas to the channel so you arent just seeing rinsed and repeated content on this weapons best on every video. You heard it here first 2021 is SMSY Families biggest year yet! With that being said TODAY IS MONDAY. Which means 1 thing &amp; 1 thing only SUPPORTER GAMES! Whilst in an ideal world it would be great if it was everyone who was a supporter on FB I do of course still let YT members/Twitch subs join in on the fun! A member is a member at the end of the day! So if you want to come play with me today then join the fun as I am live now on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/siimssyy\">www.facebook.com/siimssyy</a> I hope you guys will come join the movement! The SMSY fam has grown expediently in the correct way in the past few months.

Some examples<br>- Around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=12m30s\">12:30</a>, the 440 kite and 272 dart count approaching phi. Couldnt you just build what you want with just darts or just kites and skew the ratio away from phi?<br>- Around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=14m10s\">14:10</a>, the straight lines drawn seem somewhat arbitrary. What is the reasoning behind drawing them there in those places? And in those angles? Could the parallel line effect happen with any lines?<br>- The fibonacci sequence around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=14m50s\">14:50</a>. Thats just because you picked exactly 34 tiles (13+21). But with one more, its either 14+21, or 13+22, so you got one number out of the sequence. Im a bit lost, as to whether in JUST when you count parallel lines whose count equals a number in the fibonacci sequence (ie when you count 55, but not 54 or 56 lines), is when you will see that the 55 is a sum of 34 longs and 21 shorts, or 21 longs and 34 shorts?<br>- Finally, around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=16m10s\">16:10</a>, where you stated that if you use both the kite and the dart, it will never work? How can you prove that? I think its just that that particular arrangement didnt work (ie bad luck) but I think if you rearrange a few or the hundreds of new blue and red pieces you placed, you can get that new pattern to work! I really dont see how, around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=16m00s\">16:00</a> when you got just the light blues and the greens, the chances of the pattern screwing up or not all rests on whether you place either the red, the blue, or both.<br><br>I mean, it might just be that im just not getting it.

Because of the 5-fold symmetry, there&#39;s no way that they can form anything (under the vertex pairing rules that prevent the trivial rhombus tiling) that&#39;s a shape that will tile the plane by itself, since that would require symmetries of a triangle, square, or hexagon.  But saying that it &quot;never repeats&quot; is just horribly misleading, because there are only a finite number of different possible vertex patterns, which obviously must repeat all over the place.

WAR was commissioned by our government and expressed as academic deconstruction from 1979 - 2014. Deconstruction is a conceptual Marxism. We are now in construction - a conceptual communism . The avant guard group Fluxus conceptualized academic freedom as ANTIFA for our government and to produce tensions for civil war and population reduction. John Cage was the principle conceptualist. I studied under academic warlock Bill Nolan of photographic memory. Our museum college of art became SACD Atlanta / SCAD. Nolan predicted at graduation in 1978 that no new axioms could be invented in visual art history painting until a new dimension in physics was discovered. 2012 and 2014 I invented new form through inventing two new conceptual arts in visual art history painting . They are self evident truth and are new axioms in visual art history and from which new civl rights for visual art, artists and art history based on art history can be established. New civl rights for Computer Handicap Recognition and Icon are part of the mix. I filed a City of Fort Myers, Florida Art and Culture Grant sponsored by the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation and administered by the SWFL Community Foundation. in 2019 I invented the formula for establishing civil rights for visual art, artists and art history based on art history and is before my City of Fort Myers, Florida. The curation for what became academic Fluxus began in 1995 to refute Foucault , Walter Benjamin and academic philosophy. Academic Fluxus has flipped to conceptual arts for democracy this past 1 16 2020 at the Bob Rauschenberg Gallery . Our simulated cultural reality was designed by John Cage and is The CAGE - the Stars and Bars of the Confederate Battleflag. Rauschenberg designed the &quot;void&quot; and created a false center of cultural and perceptual gravity to throw the Pursuit of Happiness and our democracy into self destruction. Art metaphysical academia has always been secret and as the need for secrecy was invented by Leonardo Da Vinci. He was the first to depict visual turbulence. I extracted new form from turbulence and in a forty year secret competition with NASA and WAR. I pioneered submitting new form in visual art history painting through local government to get around the academic prohibition on the recognition of a new form or new conceptual art in painting. 2014 academia believed it was impossible for an individual to assert their own art history as art history and started &quot;construction &quot; - conceptual communism to celebrate the victory of conceptual cultural Marxism - deconstruction . i am very challenged and also oppressed by my City and Grant authorities. <a href=\"http://markcranford.com/\">markcranford.com</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T03:20:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Sanders", "comment_text": "Thank goodness someone else wasted all of their own time, so I wouldn&#39;t have to.", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T03:00:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pawe\u0142 Audionysos", "comment_text": "That is all fascinating but, how a student found a set of 20 426 tiles in 1961?

It is really amazing. I do have a question for you though. You mention that there is an infinite number of Penrose tilings that are all distinct from each other. This made perfect sense to me when you showed that you can make arbitrary choices while constructing a Penrose tiling that will lead to long-range effects and change the tiling entirely. However, then you went on to say that there is a set of local &quot;vertex rules&quot; that are strong enough to make sure you don&#39;t make any mistake. Does that not mean that you can &quot;uniquely specify&quot; a Penrose tiling by just a set of vertex rules? This, I believe, cannot be true because you would need an infinite set of rules to specify a Penrose tiling uniquely. This would also contradict another point you made in your video that you can never tell two Penrose tilings apart by just looking at a finite portion of it. This means that I could never find out what those &quot;vertex rules&quot; actually are for any Penrose tiling, no matter how big a portion of the tiling I take into account. I would hope that physical materials do not have an infinite set of rules about how various molecules align with each other. This leads to the question: are there actually perfect quasicrystals in nature?", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T02:21:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tsar Nicholas", "comment_text": "dude i swear to you i heard the halo reach ost on here", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T02:19:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Milehighkei", "comment_text": "Clark Richert is a painter that was experimenting with this pattern in the early 60s, several years before Penrose published his findings.", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T02:16:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DL Dissolving", "comment_text": "SMOKE METH EVERYDAY", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T02:14:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "legato7798", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=11m48s\">11:48</a> - &quot;It&#39;s FUTILE&quot;  ?!

It resembles like the eternity symbol wrapped in 2 decagons fused together. <br><br>We should expand that. The part with Aa is just one direction where they expanded after the core pattern - it&#39;s not part of the core, which is inside those shapes I punned &#39;eonogon&#39;s and the stars. From the stars we see their relation to both the decagons, and &#39;eonogons&#39;, and the small pentagons. Then we can expand beyond the &#39;eonogon&#39;s, like the 2 decagons up beside the top &#39;eonogon&#39; did (and the basic tiles, the pentagons). <br><br>The core pattern should always be expanded in 5 directions at the same time, then we&#39;d see it works. Here it was only expanded upwards towards the decagon with the Aa letters - with the 3 stars, 2 decagons and all those little pentagons over the &#39;eonogon&#39;, plus the line between then and the stars in the core pattern of 6 stars. Just compare all the 5 sides of the 5 cornered core shape: 4 sides were not continued, on the top side was. <br><br>When continuing the pattern to each 5 directions at the same time, the abstract underlying great pentagon, into which corners the new shapes would come, is alternating between having a top corner (like first the decagons forming the corners of an underlying pentagon around the central star) and a bottom corner in the next phase (like the stars after the decagons).<br><br>Decorating floors and walls (with bigger tiles) would be beautiful with it.

But if anyone wants to have a go at this pattern? - I tried quite a while ago (while I was bed bound with illness unfortunately - I had already done an E8 by hand...). It was too difficult in the end, and I couldn&#39;t discern if it really had anything interesting. But the process started by taking an e^x curve and then essentially converting it into approximately a straight line of y = 0.5*x by converting the axis into degrees (so infinity would be 90 degrees on each axis) - this is perhaps the most interesting thing as it had a bearing on how neatly the pattern came out in the end.<br><br>Then I basically wrapped that graph onto half of a hemi-sphere going from -90 degrees to +90 degrees on the x-axis, and 0 to 90 degrees on the -axis. This then gave approximately a fibonacci curve of the y=0.5*x graph I had when viewed from above. Repeating this a further 180 degrees gives you another fibonacci curve that meets the first one - so that it forms two spiral arms. Do another repitition of that to get another hemi-sphere underneath - to get a full sphere - and then the four fibonacci-like curves all meet at their end points in one continuous line.<br><br>Then what I did was to repeat this 60 times onto a dodecahedron - starting by rotating the x-axis (about the y-axis) 5 times (72 degrees each time), and then rotating this 3 times (or 6 times...? - I can&#39;t remember?) about the x-axis to give three evenly rotated circular rings. You basically end up with a pattern you get on a football/soccer ball made up of 12 pentagons and 20 triangles - but made from these 60 fibonacci-type curves...   I adjusted them ever so slightly so that they all line up at the tangents where they met one-another, which goes back to what equation is best to describe them originally? (i.e. going back to the e^x question earlier).<br><br>As they looked like fibonacci curves I continued them on into full spirals and again found that they all seemed to match up. I guess I could&#39;ve tried any number of combinations of patterns, but I was doing it by hand so chose just one.<br><br>I didn&#39;t stop their though. I tried drawing it again on computer and then put inside hyperversions as well as another 60 spirals going in the opposite direction on each hyper-sphere - with ever smaller hyper-versions skrinking down to infinity. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have an equation for the curve that I thought felt like the best fit along it&#39;s whole length to give the best pattern. But I basically had a two-dimensional fibonacci-type spiral that gave the illusion of projecting off into the distance (a false perspective), that was mapped onto hyper-spheres in theory an infinite numebr of times - and this appeared to produce all kinds of patterns as different curves joined up with each other as sphere was rotated. I was more trying to make something that looked cool - but I seemed to have ended up with a really difficult maths problem I couldn&#39;t solve (or reduce to a simpler form) instead.", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:41:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Meronek", "comment_text": "These aperiodic Penrose tilings seem like they would make amazing bathroom floor patterns.", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:39:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Master Ed", "comment_text": "I think my eyes have just gone kaput", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:39:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lou San", "comment_text": "I finished the video to the end and I don\u2019t know why?", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:38:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil Tessier", "comment_text": "I haven watched the video yet but I see repeating patterns in the thumbnail", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:37:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ronnie", "comment_text": "That scp illustrated music starting at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=1m58s\">1:58</a>.", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:36:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "glass water", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=15m00s\">15:00</a> well thats illuminati confirmed", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:36:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dustin Wood", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not a pattern of it doesn&#39;t repeat", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T14:36:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BobWidlefish", "comment_text": "How many things are possible that we think is impossible?

Not quite. The Golden Mean is an irrational number, and therefore can not be expressed as a fraction, or in another word, as a ratio. 440 over 272 is a fraction, which is a ratio, therefore a rational number. When factored down to its simplest form, it is equivalent to 55 over 34, which also happen to be two adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The ratios formed by dividing adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci sequence by each other approach the Golden Mean, but never actually reach it. So it would be accurate to say that 440 over 272 is found in a sequence of numbers which approach the Golden Mean, but claiming equivalence is a mistake. With all that aside, dividing 440 by 272 yields a fraction which begins with 1.6176470. The decimal quantity which represents the Golden Mean begins with 1.6180339. Close, but no cigar.

Just because we know something doesnt mean that its finite and just is and so there is no way around it or alternative views. Yes there are rules that we follow but what about finding better rules or exceptions to the rules. I think we have this holy grail mindset where we have found one aspect of something and we just shelf it as is and move on using it as a rigid unbreakable reference.  Its like when Richard Browning, who reinvented the personal Jet Pack, went to scientist acquaintances and showed them ideas and designs and the first thing they did was say cant be done cus all the forces and mechanics would just lead to self failure. All of this with out actually testing or making the device, welp X amount of years later and he has a world renowned company thats doing live test for random people.

But if one pattern is infinite wouldn&#39;t it also contain the other infinite kites and darts patterns? Making it a singular kites and darts pattern? I know that there are different kinds of infinity but for like, example, pi, couldn&#39;t we just say because pi is infinite, it contains every string of number which means there&#39;s an infinite amount of pi? ((I know that&#39;s not how pi works it&#39;s a really bad example but that&#39;s the first thing I thought of that was infinite.) Let&#39;s move away from the pi thing. The kites and darts pattern - for one specific pattern to extend the entire length and width of space and continue so on would have literally every single other infinite kites and darts pattern which are also infinite and therefore take on the same length and width of space and so on. So wouldn&#39;t that just be one singular pattern? Or they just happen in different &quot;parts&quot; of the pattern? but wouldn&#39;t that make it an aperiodic tiling? or am I missing something?

So, 72 and 36 which both different is 9, so equal to 18, so to 9. So, the difference is to connect to a circle that is not even, except the center radius or diameter that rotates the center. So, it is connected to the ratio of horizontal and vertical, so both are even, h and v, that is. So, the square is connected to 360 which connects to the circle, so the circle and square are connected to the pattern above that has 5 sides. So, 5 is connected to 10, so 5 is half, so half of the whole which has a diameter up and diameter down, so it is 5 to whole. So, there is a pattern of the infinity of non-pattern which connect to the circle since there is no straight line but a straight line is so small so it has 90 degrees but you can&#39;t see it, so it represents a whole, so a straight line and degree at the same time. So, the dot on the pencil is a circle right, so it has 4 radii but so small, so it has 4 straight lines but you view as a curve, so that is what you can&#39;t see but see a straight line which a straight line show a pattern into a circle as a whole, so small and big that meets so same as the fractal pattern. The more details you know, the connect you will see, and the more understanding, which connects to design that has a pattern, well, not a simple pattern but the smallest that build up from the smallest that is connect to 5, so it could be 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, but only one that is 5. So, seems come down non-period pattern come from two different patterns, so that is a pattern of two down to logical way which is the same as one that is constant, and different that is non-constant, so that is the second one that represents the non-constant constant, so come down to two from smallest to biggest. That is a pattern as a fractal pattern. <br><br>So, 5 is perfect for two since you have 5 to 10, so 1 is 1, 5 is 1/2, so it has two different, down to 50 percent up to 100 percent, that is a pattern. A fractal pattern as analog. Or a physical pattern. And 180 and 360 are connected to 2 and 3. So, both total is 5. Lowest fractal pattern. So, the baseline is 5 as total connects to 1 + 2 = 3, so beg, middle, end, so it is smooth connect to 3. Start, process, end, so that is the physical pattern as represent that is 3 which people use as 3 in the pattern. 72 and 36 are connected to 3 and 2. So, that means you use 5 so you will find a period pattern, so infinity non-pattern which is a more impressive finite pattern even finite is large. The above which has a pattern like a star, rectangle within the same degree on the same plane, but as a whole for each series of the whole is non-pattern, like star to next star in the next section is a non-star, and even it is a star, but that star is higher angle up or down, or so. Ok, I am wrong, so there is a pattern of the whole within the same degree and the same plane, but It is not about the whole itself but the depth of the whole which is a layer up or down, so the later up which shows a straight line which has 3, 4, 5, in connecting to the number of color lines that is 3, 4, 5 with pattern picture that I could for different color lines that is 3, 4, 5. That match principle which the whole is not really whole but a section of a unit which is different to a whole, but has a depth that is 3D that is a pattern. So, the whole is the 3D section of 2D. To section itself of 1D, the knowledge which adds to the unit as 2D, so the whole as 3D. It is connected to a triangle which has 3 like 3 times that equal to 9, so connect to the circle. Well, there is a pattern to find which I find above from the triangle. So, match the shape that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, that is a bi-line but different layer which has different deg. Three same bi-line down to 3 as a pattern. There is two same bi pattern, 3 bi pattern, and 2 bi pattern, but those pattern that is 3 and 2 are different of 2 patterns. 3 same and 2 same, so two different in connecting to 5, so match half of whole to whole. So, basically, it is a geometry pattern in a unit of straight lines. So, straight lines have two different, so will equal to 5. 1 of one kind and 1 of another, and both two 1&#39;s so that is 2, so in a total of different is 3.<br><br>3 represents the different same as bi-line is the same, but a non-bi line like horizontal and vertical is different so as 2, to rotate from either V or H to next either V or H to become a curve around so that is different. H, V, and complete C are different as 3. So, that is why there is a constant difference since it represents the whole of the units. The dart and kite both is same bi-line and same width, but bottom line is different as both are up and down, so represent three. The geometry that is different as two and line that is different as a whole so the end is not a square but shift square. That is 3 as a whole.

I also became fascinated with the artist, M.C. Escher and produced drawings which gave further insight into mathematics. One of the drawings was a revelation when I realised that by accurately drawing a Golden Rectangle with its largest square defined at one end, I could then draw diagonals from corners, and repeat the process again and again, including using the points of the square, with the basic rule that any new line must intersect with at least two previous intersections. I soon realised this could be done indefinitely and INFINITELY, and that in the limit, every point in the plane would be covered \u2026<br>It was, in effect, a two dimension &#39;quasi-crystal&#39;.

(This problem is known as the tiling problem)<br><br>But as an algorithm cannot just try all possible tilings of the infinite plane, we need to be smarter and reduce everything to finitely many checks.<br>The first thing Wang noticed, was that whenever a set of tiles could not tile the whole plane, it must already fail to tile a square of some finite size.<br>This is not too hard to show and only needs some (infinite) combinatorics, feel free to try it yourselves or reply if you want a hint!<br><br>For finite squares, it is easy to decide whether a set of tiles can completely tile the square: Just try out all combinations. This is of course ridiculously inefficient, but at the moment, we only care about whether it is possible, not whether it is doable in an efficient manner. Now, given a set of tiles, we can just try out whether it can tile the 1x1 square, then try the 2x2 square, next the 3x3 square and so on. If the set cannot tile the whole plane, we will eventually find out. If we can tile the whole plane, we will however try finite squares forever and never terminate. (This shows that the non-tiling problem is recursively enumerable, if you know these terms)<br><br>It thus remains to find \u2018finite\u2019 proofs that a set can tile the plane. Here, periodicity of tilings came in: It is also easy to check whether a set of square tiles can tile the plane periodically with period length n (say in both directions): Just try all possible tilings and check whether the opposite edges also fit together. Doing this for all possible period lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \u2026 once again would terminate if and only if the set can tile the plane periodically.<br><br>Combining these two \u2018algorithms\u2019 yields the following:<br>For n=1, 2, 3, 4, \u2026<br>    Try out all possible tilings of the n\u00d7n square.<br>    If there is no valid tiling, reply \u2018There is no tiling of the plane\u2019<br>    If there is some tiling for which the opposite edges fit together, reply \u2018There is a periodic tiling of the plane\u2019 <br><br>This algorithm terminates if and only if there either is no tiling of the plane or there is a periodic one.<br>In particular, if every set that allowed a tiling of the plane allowed a periodic tiling, this algorithm would be the decision procedure we are after.<br>This led Wang to propose his conjecture that this was indeed the case.<br><br>His student, Robert Berger, disproved Wang&#39;s conjecture a few years later by constructing his \u2018aperiodic\u2019 tile set and he even went on and proved that no decision procedure for the tiling problem could exist, by reducing it to the algorithmic undecidability of the halting problem. Berger&#39;s proof was pretty technical and lengthy and was later simplified by Robinson using his 6-tile set. Robinson&#39;s proof was however still lengthy.<br>Moreover, both also proved that the Periodic-Tiling problem was algorithmically undecidable and even recursively inseperable from the non-tiling problem (if you know what that means :D)<br><br>If you know what a Turing machine is, the following addition might also be of interest:<br>But Berger also proved a weaker result which easier to prove and (in my opinion) more usefull: The undecidability of the constrained tiling problem.<br>This is the following problem: Given a set of edge-coloured square tiles and a single tile that I already placed in the plane, can you complete this to a tiling of the whole plane?<br>What Berger did to prove undecidability, was to encode arbitrary computations via Turing machines into tile sets. More precisely, he used rows in the plane to encode the tape of a Turing machine and used consecutive rows to encode the evolution of the tape after one computation step. It is not too hard to produce a tile set that forces the row of the original tile I placed to consist of only empty tape symbols and forcing consecutive rows to be valid computation steps is also not too hard. You can try that yourselves and reply if you need help :)<br>Now, the tile set we get can tile the upper half of the plane if and only if there is an infinite computation sequence, i.e. if and only if the machine does not halt, which is of course undecidable. The lower half of the plane can be trivially tiled by introducing blank tiles or something like that.<br><br>The really nice thing about this construction is that it immediately restricts to time and space bounded Turing machines. If we have a machine that never uses more than<br>n tape cells and always terminates after time t, we do not need to worry about the whole infinite plane, but can restrict ourselves to such an n\u00d7t rectangle that we want to tile. In particular, if we have a machine that runs in polynomial time, we can transform this into a tile set that tiles some square of polynomial size if and only if the machine accepts on some specific input. The same works for nondeterministic machines, which shows that we can reduce any NP-problem to a polynomial-sizebounded tiling problem. As these are also easiliy seen to be NP, this proves NP-completeness, without needing to reduce the problem to some already known NP-complete problem.<br><br>The same trick works to prove NEXPTIME-completeness of the exponentially-sizebounded tiling problem and indeed NTIME(f)-completeness of the f-sizebounded tiling problem for sufficiently fast-growing functions f.<br><br>I hope some of the above text is ok to read.

IT&#39;S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES<br>ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK &#39;READ MORE&#39;)<br><br>There are some things that you should know:<br><br>1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:<br><br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a> &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot;<br><br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a> &quot;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:&quot;<br><br>It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.<br><br>2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:<br><br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> &quot;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;<br><br>Ro 5:8 &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;<br><br>Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It&#39;s the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That\u2019s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won&#39;t go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won\u2019t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.<br><br>3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).<br><br>Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.<br><br> Heb <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48sCx-wBs34&amp;t=9m22s\">9:22</a> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.<br><br>You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him. <br><br>Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.<br><br>Ro 10:9,10;13 &quot;that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;<br><br>4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:<br><br>\u201dDear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.\u201d<br><br>If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.<br>2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it&#39;s the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).<br>3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.<br>4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.<br>5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.<br><br>FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:<br>6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.<br>7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron&#39;s moving magnetic field.<br>8. There are probably no such thing as &quot;gluons&quot; in actual reality.<br>9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.<br>10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.<br>11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.<br>12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.<br><br>THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:<br>13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is &quot;gravity&quot;.  It&#39;s the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, &quot;gravity&quot; flips and EM goes to minimum, then &quot;gravity&quot; flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it&#39;s maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.<br>14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling &#39;gem&#39; photon) is the energy unit in this universe.<br>15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.<br>16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.<br>17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.<br>18. Everything is basically &quot;light&quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with &quot;light&quot; (photons).<br><br>THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:<br>19. When the electron with it&#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.<br>20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.<br>21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.<br><br>NOTES:<br>22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.<br>25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.<br>26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.<br><br><br><br>Here is the test for the &#39;gravity&#39; portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.<br><br>a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.<br>b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o&#39;clock positions.<br>c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o&#39;clock positions.<br>(The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)<br>d. Shoot a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.<br>e. Do this with the em fields on and off.<br>(The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results.)<br>f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.<br>(Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)<br>(And note:  if done right, it&#39;s possible a mini gravitational black hole might form.  Be ready for it.  In addition, it&#39;s possible a neutrino might be formed before the black hole stage, the neutrino being a substance with a very high gravitational modality with very low &#39;em&#39; modalities.)<br><br>(An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)<br><br>&#39;If&#39; effects are noted, &#39;then&#39; further research could be done.<br>&#39;If&#39; effects are not noted, &#39;then&#39; my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what &#39;gravity&#39; was not, which is still something in the scientific world.

We\u2019ve all lied and we\u2019ve all stolen, which makes us liars &amp; thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all. <br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death &amp; hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect &amp; sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, &amp; endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death &amp; rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..<br><br>So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, &amp; through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, &amp; the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved . <br><br>The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, &amp; also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; now the choice is yours.

I had fun putting together, homage to the fun I had watching :) ... Penrose number system is a set of numbers consisting of exactly two natural numbers and an infinite number of rational and irrational numbers between them, with the enclosing elements being one and the highest number of lines in a single tile. In a Penrose tiling system the ratio between the two tile types will always be a number from the Penrose number system. Golden ratio, being a member of the Penrose number system, appears periodically when increasing the number of tiles. The number of tiles needed to increment the total number of tiles to the next one with Golden ratio is called the Penrose sequence. Although the minimum number of tiles to have exact Golden ratio is currently only theoretical, with infinite number of tiles, the number of elements in Penrose sequence is by definition indefinite and therefore contains the exact Golden ratio. Such sequence could be compared to a set of natural numbers each derivative of an indeterminable lowest element from the set. Penrose alignment is a theoretical concept explaining practical parallelism in a Penrose tiling system with infinite number of tiles. If we define Penrose median as a straight line between focal points of any two adjacent tiles, any pair of such medians between any two sets is never exactly parallel and is defined as practically parallel relative to only two sets of tiles in a system with infinite number of tiles. That&#39;s why each new placed tile has to be either adjacent to the last placed tile or in exactly one of two possible positions when adjacent to any other tile.", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T13:38:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "pantopia", "comment_text": "\u2018There are no quasicrystals only quasi scientists\u2019 has to be possibly the best burn ever.

But when I think of a geometric pattern I tend to think of ones that repeat in some way, since that&#39;s by far my most common experience. Some examples of non-repeating infinite patterns: the fibbonaci sequence, or just all the integers in order. Or a tiling that contains at least one shape which is composed of multiple tiles and can be formed by at least two distinct arrangements of tiles; you can swap out one arrangement for another in some infinite non-repeating pattern. This realization kills the premise of this video for me. It also directly leads to the fact that there are an infinite number of distinct infinite patterns within a given family even though by looking at any finite section of one it is impossible to tell which infinite pattern you&#39;re looking at. (This may not be obvious to everyone, and a video on this may be interesting in itself.)<br><br>Then there&#39;s the classification of patterns used here. A pattern is said to be repeating if it is priodic, and otherwise non-repeating. But this ignores other forms of repetition, and symmetry. Even though Penrose tiling isn&#39;t periodic, it is symmetric and <b>any</b> given section can perfectly overlap with some other section if you allow rotation as well as translation. Which fits my intuitive understanding of &quot;repeating pattern&quot;.<br><br>Then there are the many many claims made with no evidence, no reasons, explanations, nothing.<br>A couple of examples: the ratio of kites to darts in a Penrose tiling is the golden ratio. A count of the tiles in an arbitrary blob shaped section being close is not much evidence.<br>And saying that Penrose tiling only almost has five fold rotational symmetry. The video shows a method of constructing Penrose tiling by starting out with a simple arrangement of pentagons which is perfectly symmetric, then splitting up these pentagons in a perfectly symmetrical way.<br>And claiming that the moire patterns demonstrate that you can&#39;t ever match two identical Penrose tilings. While an interesting visual, this was not an exhaustive search and did not even examine the one obvious symmetry (or almost symmetry, as the video claims) of rotating around the Pentagon at the center of the pattern.<br><br>And this may be more pedantic, but the storytelling didn&#39;t work for me at all either. At the end of the video I have no sense of a story at all, no sequence of events; just a very confusing look at Penrose tiling. Even after a second watch, for example, I see no connection between the city and museum mentioned at the beginning, except that they are in some way related to one of the people in the &quot;story&quot; but are ...never mentioned again?

The symmetries a pattern/tiling of the plane can have are called <i>wallpaper groups</i> and there are (up to conjugacy) exactly 17 of them.<br><br>For example you can create a tiling of the plane by repeatedly reflecting an isosceles triangle (with or without rotationally symmetric pattern on it) across its edges. This would give you the wallpaper group 3*3 or *333, where both groups have mirror symmetry and 3-fold rotational symmetry around the vertices, but only the former also has 3-fold rotational symmetry around the centers of the tiles. You could also create a tiling by &quot;rolling&quot; a triangular pillow (with mirror reflected patterns on each side) from face to face over its edges. This would result in the wallpaper group 333 which has three different 3-fold rotational symmetries around the points where the pointy ends of the pillow landed. Or you could roll a cylinder with a pattern on it across a strip of the plane and repeatedly reflect the strip to fill out the plane, which would give you the wallpaper group **. It has translational symmetry and mirror symmetry perpendicular to the translation.<br><br>Wikipedia has a beautiful article about this topic with example patterns: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#The_seventeen_groups\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#The_seventeen_groups</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T08:44:25Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jan \u010cuda", "comment_text": "Gyro Zeppeli aproves this pattern", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T08:44:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zimodo", "comment_text": "whats with the weird aspect ratio", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T08:43:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bilakshan Purohit", "comment_text": "It&#39;s similar when a magician tells you how he will perform a trick with insights but you still can&#39;t figure it out how he did that.<br><br>Science and Mathematics languages of universe.<br><br>I dunno this gives me felling to give answers to Time Travel and Interdimensional travel", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T08:43:08Z", "likes_count": 20}, {"comment_by": "Vicente Coentro", "comment_text": "Mind boggling", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T08:42:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tiesergrote", "comment_text": "amazing!", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T08:42:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Essney Allen", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t Pauling one of those Noble winners that went entirely crackpot in his later years?

Here many things of that happened to me and what I DID: \r<br><br>1- A Professor told me in the Class &quot;This circuits of AND, OR and XOR or impossible to build with CMOS in another way, only like that as we use it. It is impossible to mode these logic functions with any change. And if someone of you do that, should get NOBEL prize&quot; \r<br>And because in my Character I hate the world &quot;Impossible&quot; I came to his office a week later with 8 different possibilities of CMOS AND, OR and XOR circuits. He didn&#39;t want to believe. I sent him the simulations results. He didn&#39;t want to believe. He took then and asked me to come later. As I came back later he tried to tell me how this circuit is not efficient enough and how this is that etc and at the end I told him &quot;There is a difference between impossible to make another thing, and one is better than the other, and I proved that it is more than possibe and even the other circuits have better benefits in other appications and not always worse, so where is my NOBEL PRIZE?&quot; ... I did the impossible .. That was unfair!\r<br>\r<br>2- I was working on a similar project to the &quot;Neuralink&quot; or Elon Mask and I had to choose the best option of an ADC and design one good for the application.\r<br>Well .. I ended developing a totally new type of an ADC with less transistors and so less space and less power etc. But my discovery and development got shamefull ignored and I got a bad degree ... why? because the system I had to use didn&#39;t want to run the last simulation and no one at the faculty could understand why the system is not running and so I had to give the final result without that simulation + because my report Germany language was not on the native level !!!! .... I did the impossible .. That was unfair! \r<br>\r<br>3-  After long years of struggling ... I landed in Ecuador and first after two years of dying everyday and after I lost all what I had I could finally work as a Researcher at a University here because of only one person who believed in my .. that was the impossible\r<br>\r<br>4- I build a team of Chemical Engineers and in only 5 weeks I could proof that it is possible to make a very useful Bio-Plastic out of Bamboo and did it and had to pay from my own money to make it ... and got ignored. .... I did the impossible .. That was unfair! \r<br>\r<br>5- I have reactivated a long forgotten discovery of European researchers and build an electronics device to try my first tests and then got amazing crazy results even stranger than the original research and could develop a better theory of the happening, and am keeping doing it. You can see what I did in my posts on LinkedIn:\r<br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dercncplaner/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dercncplaner/\r</a><br>\r<br>6- Now the next Mission Impossible for me: \r<br>going to Vancouver trying to work on a company specialized on Stem Cells because I say it clearly: I can build a process to control the development Stem Cells to make Biological Logic Electronics and more.\r<br>\r<br>I am trying and trying and it looks like, that the fact of carrying a Syrian Passport will keep making my life hard and experiencing unfairness all the time\r<br>\r<br>Why this world doesn&#39;t look at what we do and ignore our documents which we are forced to have?\r<br>\r<br>But .. do you know what? yes it looks like impossible, but I keep going and will do it!\r<br>\r<br>And you too ...
