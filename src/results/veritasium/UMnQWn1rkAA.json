Think about it, isn&#39;t it just much too fascinating to ignore the fact that we are made of just up/down quartz and electrons, and somehow these combine in a way to create our amazing &quot;consciousness&quot; that can SEE and even INVESTIGATE the very same universe that gave us our existence in the first place? And this is even more interesting if you were to model the human race as one united living body, wherein every person on earth could be represented by a single cell, and they communicate with each other via internet.
