If entanglement was applied to light, it would not be isolated from its sun or galaxy it is passing, so E=h*f could be inflicted. ... Some have also suggested a bend-stretch around suns. ... So, for many, giving automatically the established answer that redshift is due to the expanding universe, would not feel fully concluded. ... And many would use Einstein to rather say there are no redshift inside the rocket, like the speed of sound inside trains refer to that frame and not outside the train. ... This brings us to inertia, in addition to superposition and entanglement. I have seen your spinning wheel, that seems to defy gravity, but by measurements not. - Have you double checked, because spinn was found to give redused gravity by some Japaneese in the 80-90s. And spinn give some non classical effects on sub atomic levels. ... So, here is the thing; In the multiverse, we have to assume entanglement can cansel out certain worlds and prioritise others. ... If a spinning wheel cansel out some &quot;directional&quot; entanglements but is engulfed with the ordinary entanglement to give about the same result, it should exist inertia that is more self contained, individualised, and to presume what supra-leading really is, encapsuled away from normal Inertia/tied entanglement, this subatomic spin-world ... And we should assume that this freeing from inertia goes even deeper, to teleport and travel in time, not just by info-based computer-chips. ... But then asking, &quot;freeing&quot; from interia was not the correct assumption entirely, but getting the inertia belonging to that and that world, which would be like adresses in space, time and even across paralell universes, then going for cancelling out space and time, because they do not exist, leaving us with relative adresses of frequencies, entanglement and rejoined inertia for where to travel or what time to send the info, counting on Earth as a framework enough to handle it, not needing the entire universe to calculate it. And besides, the universe would by superposition be baked into this much &quot;smaller&quot; frame. ... By the way, I noticed by combined YouTube clips that Schr\u00f6dinger was lesser keen on admitting the Multiverse early on, was then over-concluded by Max Born, but seemed to conclude more in direction of a Multiverse in 1952. ...

I was born by the river too, but without the silencing distracting tent. ... You forgot to mention Michelson and Morley as basis background for Einsteins C, speed of light. They found no friction in the ether, and the speed of light was the same in all directions. ... But now we know entanglement-inertia can be everywhere from immediate to for instance riples in the water or the speed of sound, and the speed of light can vary and even be tunnelled to many times the speed of light, while warp-reseachers wants to curve vacuum, saying it is not nothingness after all, perhaps a war-p that is cheating themselves, and the public, like noone bothers to evaluate if the quantum fluctuations statistically also could inflict on the redshift, this bobling sea, that could perhaps be described as a blink observation of the multiverse potentials. ...

My reasoning is fairly simple.  I speculate that the universe is expanding a &quot;relatively&quot; slower rate the larger it gets.  The actual rate might be uniform, but as the space gets larger, the percentage of added space is a smaller percentage of the distance from that point of origination, creating the illusion of slowing if we could see it in real time.  But, we can&#39;t see it in real time, because the objects are so far away that the light from the furthest objects dates back to a time when space was much smaller.  <br><br>Further, it is my understanding and belief that the rate of expansion of the universe exceeds the speed of light.  And, if this is true, then I also believe that the light from the beginning can&#39;t ever reach us.  All we can ever hope to see are the objects that are moving in the same general direction as us with relation to the expansion of space, and whose relative motion is not &quot;away&quot; from us at a speed greater than the speed of light. <br><br>So, this brings me to my question.  If my assumptions are correct, then looking further back in time would give us a picture of a universe with objects that are relatively closer together than they are now.  Obviously when we look out we see the totality at once.  We see objects only minutes old, and objects millions of years in the past all at once.  But has anyone ever filtered out the objects by time-slice such that we could essentially count and measure distance of objects of similar age?  The distance between objects is more or less what I am interested in understanding.  Does the average relative distance between objects of the same time-bucket decrease?  I would think it would if we could look back far enough.

If everything is expanding outward, and space itself is expanding (carrying us with it) faster than the speed of light, how is light then able to reach us from back in time when the big bang happened?\r<br>2. It is said that the big bang didn&#39;t happen in a &quot;location&quot; in space, but then I hear the same people also say that everything was once contained at a single infinite &quot;point&quot; prior to the big bang and then &quot;BANG&quot; everything that was contained in that single point is now shooting through space at incredible speeds and even space itself is expanding outward... Why do physicists say everything was once contained in a &quot;single point&quot;? How is it possible for a &quot;point&quot; to exist if spacetime itself was contained within that point?\r<br>3. Why do physicists say that the distant galaxies we see are &quot;old&quot; in the sense that they represent a time closer to the origin of the big bang? I understand the concept that the light we see from distant galaxies takes a very very long time to reach us, which means the light we are seeing is what that galaxy was like when the light first started traveling toward us, but how does this mean that the &quot;old&quot; galaxy we see has anything to do with the origins of the big bang, and how could we possibly measure how close that is to the origins of the big bang? \r<br>4. If we are moving with space at a greater speed than light (because of space itself expanding) this means that there are galaxies moving away from us that we will never see because the light will never reach us unless we one day learn to fold space ourselves, so we can&#39;t measure how vast space is exactly. Heck, some say space is infinite. How could we ever possibly know the origins of the big bang if we can&#39;t measure space? \r<br>5. How could we possibly tell that &quot;the universe&quot; is expanding &quot;outward&quot; if we can&#39;t actually measure the size of the universe in its entirety? Is it not just as likely that space (if its finite) outside of our observable universe is trillions of times bigger than our current observable universe and as a whole isn&#39;t actually expanding outward, and what we see isn&#39;t the whole story? For example, I could observe the atmosphere here in Australia and I could theoretically (with enough data) predict how the weather is going to behave long into the future, but if my observations were confined to the atmosphere within/above(?) Australia only, and I could not observe the outside world, It is not possible to predict the weather long into the future because it is only a small part of what is happening on a larger scale. Is it possible that the expansion of our current observable universe is just a small part of what is actually happening on a much larger scale outside of what we can currently observe? Isn&#39;t it just as likely that galaxies outside of where we can currently observe could actually be expanding through space toward us, as the &quot;Big Freeze&quot; theory that we will just continue expanding outward and eventually just fade into darkness?", "comment_date": "2022-07-07T08:31:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JP", "comment_text": "Sometimes I wonder whether a lot of Cosmology isn&#39;t just straight up BS.", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T12:46:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Conor", "comment_text": "Probably a dumb question and I\u2019ve got much to learn and if gravity from what I know pulls things in and dark energy pulls things out\u2026 is there an end/edge to space?

Now gather all the balloons together so they are touching, and suspend them in a vacuum so they float and surround each other and then create a process that inflates them from the inside.

If we r accelerating @ a constant speed then u r true but if d acceleration stops then ur theory could be debated by plenty scolars. 1 more example, if we r traveling in a bus n d bus accelerated to @ 60km/hr n now d speed becomes constant n we try to walk in d bus then we will only need same energy as we were walking on land.

I imagined the universe as a big empty box of nothing. Then I imagined that there were things in the center of the big box that were each moving out and away from that center point and also away from each other - perhaps from the result of what was called the big bang.<br><br>Years later I began to wonder if perhaps the box was expanding and the things inside the box were still moving out from the starting point within the ever expanding box. It was as if the box was expanding out on purpose to make room for the things in the box to continue traveling away from the starting point. If the box was not expanding then the things in the box that were moving  out would eventually reach the limit of the box and crash into the sides of the box.<br>So the real question had been is space itself expanding?<br><br>But the box could not have physical sides so what would happen if the things inside of the box  reached the limits of the box? Would they compress and stop moving? Perhaps the limits of the box are defined by some force that acted as sides of the box. Seems like I should have thought of the box as a sphere instead. So maybe the universe is like an expanding balloon with stuff inside that is moving outward from the origin point at the center of the balloon. The balloon is expanding fast enough to keep giving the stuff a place to move into. <br><br>The real question became - what is space expanding into ?<br>I could not imagine the outside edge of space. If I compare it to a fence and I am sitting on the fence then how could there be space on one side of the fence but not on the other side?<br><br>So I was stuck.

So you\u2019re getting bigger, but everything else is too, so you don\u2019t notice. 2) because is expanding, the SPACE ITSELF within you, ie the volume of space actually within your skin, is expanding, but you are not. Like the video says, only #2 is true. Why not #1? While space is expanding, electromagnetic forces still pull electrons in toward protons and nuclear forces still pull protons and neutrons toward each other, so atoms resist the natural expansion of the space they occupy and stay the same size. So that means if you could color space itself the same way you can add food coloring to water to see movement, and you colored the space itself contained within your body, you\u2019d stay the same size but you\u2019d watch the color permeate out of you skin and spread out beyond you. So that\u2019s why when you\u2019re standing on earth you\u2019re actually accelerating <b>*upward*</b> just like in a rocket ship - Gravity from the earth is pulling Space itself in toward the center, so if the earth didn\u2019t have a surface, you\u2019d naturally be pulled in too along with the space you occupy (you\u2019d be effectively at rest relative to the space you occupy, but that space is being pulled in), so because earth has a surface, it\u2019s actually pushing you outward relative to the space that\u2019s being pulled inward. Hence, there\u2019s a force (and therefore acceleration) pushing up from the surface against you, pushing you further outward against the space that\u2019s being sucked into the center for the earth, even though you appear to be standing still <br><br>Ok some of the language there probably isn\u2019t perfect, but I think that\u2019s mostly right.", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T02:46:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stig Henning Johansen", "comment_text": "My problem is that space itself is emty space.

It is a big problem for physicists when it comes to pursuing the theory of everything in physics.<br><br>Doubt arises. Do quantum theories and the theory of relativity describe the universe correctly.<br><br>I think they misrepresent the universe.<br><br>The theory of relativity contains concepts that man cannot understand. This is openly stated by the so-called experts themselves.<br><br>For example, the so-called the expansion of space cannot be described in words, nor visually.<br><br>The light has been found to be more elongated, i.e. more redshifted, from the more distant galaxy clusters the light comes from. This has been interpreted as galaxy clusters moving away from us the farther away they are.<br><br>Suddenly it could be concluded from this that we are in the middle of the universe and all the galaxy clusters are moving away from us the faster the farther they are.<br><br>This, of course, was not an appropriate view almost immediately after we had abandoned the country-centered model, whose erroneous view was that we were at the center of the universe.<br><br>No, we cannot be in the middle of the universe.<br><br>Something had to be invented and so it was done. Georges Lema\u00eetre, a Belgian astronomer and priest, developed a completely new view from the beginning of everything where at first there was nothing, not even space, nor time.<br><br>This new theory was called the Big Bang. According to the theory, everything comes from one point so that there was no energy at that point and space did not expand outward into an already existing place. That is, it is not an explosion in the traditional way. It&#39;s about something else entirely. Something you can&#39;t describe in words, not visually. It is therefore very special that this model has developed into a so-called a standard model taught as truth. That is, even if the event in question cannot be described in words, nor visually.<br><br>This was so special to me about 20 years ago that I decided to figure out how the universe really works. I did the same.<br><br>I assumed that space is an infinite three-dimensional ever-existing space that is itself nothing at all. That is, according to this premise, I had to be able to explain all observations using space-based, space-moving, and space-changing systems.<br><br>What is the change based on.<br><br>The change is, of course, based on the fact that the separate parts of the changing system move in relation to each other and that movement takes place somewhere. That place is this always-existent infinite three-dimensional space that is absolutely nothing.<br><br>And when space itself is absolutely nothing, then then it cannot change in any way and thus no space is needed in the background of space anymore.<br><br>How, then, do we explain that the farther the lights come from, the more stretched the cosmologically redshifted. That is, if space does not expand.<br><br>Well, simply so that there is no separate matter and four separate forces, as is currently assumed.<br><br>It must be understood that everything basically consists of one and the same thing, which in itself is a pushing force.<br><br>The substance consists of congestion areas of this pushing force so that these congestion areas circulate this pushing force with all other corresponding congestion areas.<br><br>Recycling requires nothing more than what is being recycled because these areas of thrust congestion are able to slow down the pace of thrust within themselves by their thrust.<br><br>Thrust congestion areas consist of even smaller thrust congestion areas, and since these smaller congestion areas circulate this thrust force, then a system of these smaller congestion areas automatically has an internal pressure that causes the thrust force in it to dissipate into a larger and larger space area. . That is, it expands outward in space into already existing space.<br><br>This recyclable pushing force also consists of separate pushing force peak areas that recirculate the pushing force.<br><br>And thus we can say that the atomic model is pushing new ones.<br><br>The nuclei of atoms expand and circulate the expanding pushing force with the cores of all other atoms expanding in space, and thus they push each other away from each other in the same proportion as they expand.<br><br>For this reason, this has not been realized, nor observed.<br><br>The trick is that this recyclable expanding pushing force is in the form that our devices cannot register it. This explains the mystery of light. That is, the wave of light and the nature of particles.<br><br>The waves of light expanding in space are dark to us, meaning we cannot register them.<br><br>However, with the help of registrable photons, the wave nature of light has protruded.<br><br>The expanding waves of expanding light consist of zillions of discrete expanding densities that circulate with each other this expanding pushing force. To form a single expanding photon, these separate expanding densities of which the dark expanding waves of light consist are required.<br><br>The zillion is not the right number in mathematics, but it illustrates well that it is a very large number of discrete expansive densities.<br><br>It is good to understand that light has a very large mass, but almost all of the mass of light expanding in space is in these dark waves.<br><br>And it is precisely because of this that it is very difficult for registrable photons to measure mass.<br><br>Electrons are also generated from these densities which make up the dark waves of light for us.<br><br>That is, from this expanding dark pushing force that the expanding nuclei of atoms circulate with each other.<br><br>Physicists studying matter do not cause an existing electron to detach around the nucleus of an atom, although the physicist thinks so when he emits light of suitable energy towards the nuclei.<br><br>That is, physicists have not realized that they themselves are causing new electrons to emerge from the dark expanding pushing force that protrudes from the expanding nuclei of atoms.<br><br>The photons they send face this expanding dark push force at a suitable distance from the expanding atomic nucleus, and as a result of the interaction, the expansion of the dark push force densities accelerates to explosive and thus the zillion discrete densities combine into a new larger entity, the new registrable.<br><br>Alright. On this basis, when we start to perceive the universe from a small scale, we also get to build a large-scale model of the universe so that we have the opportunity to develop a functional theory of everything in physics.<br><br>Jukka Savorinen", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T21:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jukka Savorinen", "comment_text": "The way the universe works in Savo terms.<br><br>Recycling is the A and O of everything<br><br>Everything basically consists of one and the same thing.<br><br>What it all basically consists of is in itself a pushing force.<br><br>There is no separate substance and four separate forces separately.<br><br>The atomic model and worldview will be revolutionized in the near future.<br><br>A direct observation of how galaxies are born from the middle / inside out proves the current theories to be incorrect.

It&#39;s misleading and wrong to use redshift as just a photon, or just a number, without explaining how it is measured.\r<br>\r<br>Without that background, this hypothetical meandering explains nothing of the origin of an expanding universe.\r<br>\r<br>My book Cosmology Crisis Cleared (published on Amazon), identifies the fundamental mistake causing the failure of cosmologists to agree on a value for Hubble&#39;s Constant. After 92 years of trying, this is a crisis.\r<br>\r<br>To clear this crisis in cosmology:\r<br>Astronomers must recognize every galaxy and quasar has its velocity measured incorrectly.\r<br>\r<br>This is because they are measured just like a star in the Milky Way.\r<br>\r<br>The velocity of a galaxy or quasar CANNOT be measured in a spectrum like a star. The 3 spectra are too different. Only a star of the 3 has a photosphere surface for attaching atoms. \r<br>\r<br>In the video, absorption lines are mentioned.  These lines apply only to a star including our Sun, but never to a galaxy or quasar. When not a star, all absorption and emission lines are from atoms in the line of sight. It is a major mistake to assume any shift of these lines apply to the huge, bright object behind the atoms.\r<br>One should note there are many galaxies and quasars with a high z value. Protons can be superluminal, but not massive galaxies and quasars. Every z&gt;1 is the proton&#39;s velocity when capturing an electron, becoming a hydrogen atom and emitting the Lyman-alpha line.\r<br>\r<br>For all galaxies and quasars, the mistake is we measure the velocity of only atoms in the line of sight. We never measure the velocity of the primary object behind those atoms.\r<br>\r<br>I can explain why the method being used since the first redshift measurement in 1912 is wrong. Unfortunately, its use persists to this day.  That is the main reason why some still believe in a ridiculous, expanding universe, based on the stretching of its invisible, undetectable fabric. This is the wrong explanation for consistently wrong velocities.\r<br>\r<br>The book analyzed over 600 galaxies. \r<br>Many galaxies have their spectra presented to reveal the process of obtaining their velocity and distance.\r<br>The consequences of this measurement mistake on cosmology are severe. \r<br>The wrong velocity values drive many theories, so they must be revised after getting correct velocity measurements.\r<br>\r<br>Among the theories affected are the universe expansion and the big bang.\r<br>\r<br>I didn&#39;t provide a link to Amazon for the book, because I have stated its important conclusion.

It couldn&#39;t just have and end, right? you couldn&#39;t travel to the end, and then fly in your ship to the other side, could you? so like counting to infinity, or travel to infinity, the universe HAS to be expanding in order to-be infinite. however, there is a problem with this. if it were &#39;traveling&#39; than that would mean there is end to it. but no. its a function of both space and time, and just like how you travel at a certain speed by traveling at a certain distance in a given time, the universes expansion compensates by travel virtually at an infinite speed. it has too. I can make this make sense by giving a example with light. if the universe wern&#39;t traveling faster than say light, than shooting light into space, eventually that light would catch up and then &#39;pass&#39; space itself. what would happen to that light on the other side? explode? maybe? maybe that&#39;s how the universe was created in the first place; by exposure to light=God", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T07:50:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Humphrey Bumblecuck", "comment_text": "So space expands not matter/etc<br>But what about frame dragging?<br>Does the other stuff expand also?

YES space is expanding, YES we are\u2026 if mass did not dynamically curve spacetime.  We are indeed being pulled apart, but our mass actually consumes spacetime (i.e., gravity) that holds us together.  The rate of expansion of spacetime is so incredibly small compared to gravitation, it is only noticeable at galactic scales.  But it is happening at the small scale nonetheless.  It is actually wrong to say that the universe red shift is only applicable at the large scale.  One of the central dogmas of physics is universality of physical laws, as well as relativity.  Relativity would not work if the physics were different at the very large scales than local scales.  Besides, this contradicts Lambda-CDM cosmology that holds that spacetime does indeed actually inflate.  This video potentially leads people to the wrong conclusion that the reason why the red shift happens is because galaxies are moving through space away from one another, but that\u2019s a wrong picture.  Especially since the red shift shows the universe\u2019s expansion is accelerating.  If the red shift were only due to a series of doppler shifts due to relative motion between galaxies, and not the introduction of additional spacetime between galaxies, then it becomes impossible to explain how galaxies are accelerating in their motion through space.  What force is actually accelerating those massive galaxies?  Expanding spacetime is the only thing that explains the acceleration of the red shift without invoking some literal force pushing galaxies apart.", "comment_date": "2021-11-14T00:29:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. James Olack", "comment_text": "Too much theory for me.

However, there is a problem with the description of the falling man <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DrBQg_n2Uo&amp;t=5m23s\">5:23</a>.  First, if he starts falling at the top, the colour he sees is the colour the photon ends up, which is red, say (the video said &quot;blue&quot;). And at the bottom he is moving fast in the opposite direction to the photon. The Doppler effect (referred to in the video) is dependent on direction - if he ran into the photon low down the tower it would be bluer for two reasons - his velocity and gravitational blueshift. So that&#39;s not the right reasoning - the colours at the top and the bottom don&#39;t agree.  Of course it would be the relativistic Doppler effect if anything (because that&#39;s the relevant physics) but this is still a direction-dependent effect that is opposite to what we are looking for. As he falls, the relativistic Doppler effect would  blueshift photons that are already more energetic because of being lower in the gravitational field (as observed by building dwellers), so this is not what we want! What works to make the photons look the same colour at all heights is the special relativistic time dilation, gamma. Let&#39;s check this.<br><br>The gravitational redshift is to first order a factor of (1 + gh/c^2), where h is the height below the top of the tower, our chosen reference (which happens to be where the falling man is stationary)<br>The velocity of the falling man is sqrt(2gh), so gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 2gh/c^2) at any distance below the top, which is to an excellent approximation (1 + gh/c^2). <br><br>Thus this factor applied to the frequencies observed by observers in the building makes the photons the same shade of red as they were at the top of the tower.

But I am still so bad at math that I can&#39;t read symbols on equations like they are distracting me and confuse me. Yes i managed somehow through school but only by imagination and making it feel right or just practicing but always each step learned why I do that. But now I can&#39;t solve equations and how could I do physics and leave law at almost 30 years old.<br><br>Why Am I telling you this? Because I was always a kid with lots of imagination. And what I saw now what Einstein found out I had exactly this in my mind why objects move through space around other objects.<br><br>I even had this imagination that objects fall down with elasticity  to break trough the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of space what I think is dark matter over all.<br>My English is not native but I will try to explain.<br><br>The universe is flat plat and it&#39;s material is dark matter with dark energy.<br>there are other universe and each of them are below the other.<br>This flat universe is elastic. So if something is in it, it falls constantly down. It stretches the universe. Here comes the clue: If the objects falls down and sinks into the abyss of universe it also stretches into the other below universe flat plat. And it sinks and sinks for like trillion and more years.<br>And Then it breaks and all the content from universe 1 comprehends into a small drop which contains all essence of the universe with all information and it drips into the next flat universe plat causing the big bang which is not Bang or explosion, it&#39;s just this small drop intrudes in a new blank universe plat causing to enhance and activate the universe plat and the information in the small blob (like a tear which falls from you eyes) causing to begin processes which led to almost same creation and developing of past universe.<br><br>If you ask why? I can explain too. The universe which I think is flat and already a system in itself. It&#39;s content is blank because nothing introduded so far. But his material is pure dark energy fields and dark matter which have properties. Properties like a straight system of almost eternity small points of energy fields which wait content to drop into the playing field to activate and work. The universe and is small particles are all connected like you pixels on the screen. Exactly that&#39;s how I would describe it. The universe and is particles are like the pixels of your screen. And each pixel is a worker and creator. It only waits for orders and commands. The dark matter and energy is the fuel for all these pixels to work and create all together simultaneously something which you see as objects and atmosphere.<br><br>And when this drop comes into the next universe it&#39;s like sperm giving life and content to a blank clear system. Then everything will arrange in billion or trillion years and will develop with trial and error a perfect system because each pixel is working while each pixel always connects and communicates with each other pixel and all pixel together in the whole universe as an overall super entity pixel.<br><br>Like I sad I see this for the first time but I always thought that we are sinking and falling. And that&#39;s why we think we expand but in reality we only fall constantly down and stretch the universe which is elastic. Causing to stretch many other universe flat plates under our universe to stretch.<br><br>Think of a elastic something gathered above the same elastic thing. If you put a heavy weight on top all level of the elastic thing will fall stretch down and object will fall.<br><br>But then there is a limit were the first on top universe rip apart and all content information of this universe will comprehend back into a single drop which will now fall down and enter a new under neath universe causing to give it live with the informations from the old universe how it is gonna have to work and the pixels which activate because they get information and the dark matter fuelling the dark emergy to work and giving them maybe somehow of consciousness because every pixel like I sad is communicating each mili second (in reality it is real life and it can&#39;t be described with a number because it&#39;s love without a single delay) and each pixel of full knowledge of each other pixel which is trillions of lightyear away and connected to the whole system as a whole.<br><br>We are falling not expending!<br><br>And that is why light is always everywhere and for as humans always faster than everything. Because it&#39;s everywhere 100% of the universe. It is the light from the energy exchange and interactions from all the pixels which work and the dark energy giving them fuel to work and energyze. That&#39;s why it is so fast because it was always everywhere. It&#39;s like the ocean contains water and if we humans thought that water=light, we would measure the speed of the water and see that it&#39;s faster than anything else when in reality it is not fast its just everywhere before now and after.<br><br>And what I forgot each pixel knows over time how to work due the information of the past universe and each pixel will give each atom and particle orders how to work and react and how to behave. Like a switch from a DNA which can&#39;t turn on our off. Every little pixel in the universe has orders and properties and behaves like he has too.<br><br>So basically the future is always written when we live in the present. The present is the future and there is no time like we humans invented. It&#39;s just we are living life and simultaneously with the universe.<br><br>And I think if some of pixels get failures and malfunction that&#39;s why sometimes we get sick or other accidents happen because some particles failed or got desynchronized and can&#39;t connect live without a delay with the other particles in the universe.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what how I do it but sometimes I can see future events to occur like a soccer game where I know that a team will wijj exactly 5:1 or will winn first halt 3:1 or the bar team will win 2:0 and so on or know which persons I will see next in the next day Whig I didn&#39;t see in years.<br>and other stuff. Call me autistic and hyper sensitive that might be the case. Some friend in school told me in a game where we should say stuff about others and guess who that is that I am a mysterious guy.<br><br>I sometimes get answers from someone else or wish something to happen and it happens and in the past I was scared because strange things happened and occurred like I wished or imagined. But i got used to it.<br><br>A couple of month before I asked this strange power that he has to show me what it is all about and what we have to do as humans and what&#39;s our goal.<br><br>The first 2 nights no answer but than on the third night he answered me in my dream and took my hand and showed me what is all about.<br><br>In summary if you die you will exist as a conscious of many particles flying around and seeing everything oj earth but you can&#39;t interact. You also can&#39;t gather knowledge. You only can take everything you gatherer as a human and all your knowledge and education will stay fixed and continue on you new entity beeing which consists of many particles like a invisible cloud connected together.<br><br>I REPEAT EVERYTHING YOU DO TILL YOUR LIFE WILL the only thing you can&#39;t take with you after death. That&#39;s what he shower me. The key and goals of human existing is to gather knowledge and if you for the energy of your consciousness, brain and thoughts is not vanished. It will live in the particles which connect and put everything together and you living on and watching. The bad part is her I REPEAT you stay this way. You are physically trapped and mentally trapped. You can&#39;t access new knowledge or make new memory&#39;s or train you capacity or whatever You stay as an observer which can think but can&#39;t do nothing.<br>He showed me that a small exception exists.

So, let us talk first about the light, wavelength, and the Energy of the light beam. Planck&#39;s law says that if you have energy depletion for any reason then the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is going to increases from white to blue to green to red, to microwaves to the sudden darkness. This is actually what we are observing and even they call it the Ryle effect. Now let speak about galaxies. Are they on unstopped trajectories motion? Yes. So, these motion for a full rotation needs time. What will happen when this trajectory time for a full rotation because of the distance will be 10 times shorter than the time needed for a light beam to arrive on Earth? That doesn&#39;t mean that when the light arrives the galaxy source will has to change position? Yes. Isn&#39;t possible for that reason some time in the Earth&#39;s historical time at the same moment we to see 10 idols of the same galaxy source? Yes, this is possible because we have already seen it. Well, does the light of these 10 idols have the same energy in these beams? No, of course not because time has passed and there are time differences between these time differences in the appearance of these beams. That means that the beams will have a different wavelength in appearance, from blue the most recent to red the eldest, and all of this because of the different energy depletion in time which is passing. If the distance of galaxies follows the Ryle appearance then the group of galaxies will be mainly blue if they are near the observer, other more far greens, other more far yellows, other reds other invisible wet but with microwave radiation expressions and others invisible, for now, at all. But in the future after 1000000 years with the same equipment, new galaxies will become visible as their light will arrive. Also, if the energy of an idol depletes a lot this idol will suddenly disappear with the speed of the instant moment. What is the main explanation given of this optic phenomenon which I describe as a Doppler phenomenon not only in space but and in time? That we have an expansion of spacetime and that makes light to red shifting. If this was correct, then again from the law of Planck&#39; there will be no energy at all in a beam to carry the light even of the nearby galaxies.

If this is the truth, then in a vacuum the speed of light is every time the same, and that also means the same wavelength, because different waves lengths mean and different light speeds. But in a vacuum, the speed of light is a constant that even gravity even God couldn&#39;t affect or change. So, that means that in the Proust experiment or the environment was causing the redshifting or the measurements because of the same speed of travel of the experiment beam and the signals beams are the same and for correct measurement you want e signal to be at an instant speed.

Anything to exist in the physical world needs hight (y), length (x) and width (z), which are unseparable and considerd as first dimension which is SPACE. <br><br>When we have a space, next question is what is in that space!, that is the next dimension of existence, which a physical material with which it is made-up of. For the convenience to express this dimension let&#39;s call this as EARTH (Physical object with a known mass, hight, length  and width).<br><br>Okay, now we have a physical object covering certain space, The next question you can ask is what are the properties of this object. Those are the next three dimensions of existence. Let&#39;s elaborate each of them, any object has its own electric charge, which we commonly say temperature of an object, referred as FIRE, third dimension. And the fire dimension of an object influences next two dimensions which are AIR and WATER. Don&#39;t take them literally,  dimension AIR basically represents the flow of energies within the physical object and the transaction of energies in and out of that object. The WATER dimension is the representation of the arrangement of individual atoms and their fluidity within their physical form. <br><br>Many physicists and modern metaphysical observations predict the existence of 10 or more dimensions! Yes it&#39;s positive because any existence in the physical world has its opposite non-physical existence which needs non-physical dimensions, which are opposite but not the same! and a transitory dimension leads existence to nothingness!<br><br><br><br>The next level to this (only for those who can perceive this!) When we say space!, space can not exist without time, for instance if we define two points in a space, to travel from point A to point B you need a certain time to cover that distance. If no distance, means no time, means no existence of space-time. Therefore,  in the physical existence there is space, that&#39;s why there is time. <br><br>Next layer to that (caution! Only for seekers of ultimate truth of existence). Time can exist only in circles, that&#39;s the reason the whole visible universe looks moving in spiral shape and expanding endlessly. Because that&#39;s the transition between non existence (form less nothingness - that which is not) to existence (a form - that which is) happens in the singularity and then which expands outword, that&#39;s where the theory of relativity and time dilation comes, but not how they explained!.  Just imagine a circle drawn on a paper,  the central point of that circle is the singularity where there is no time and space exists, because in that point there is no distance to travel, so no time! And now check the outer line of that circle,   fir instance! to travel 30\u00b0 you need to travel a long distance so need more time, but to travel the same distance of 30\u00b0 close to the central point of the circle you need to travel less distance means less time. That&#39;s how the time difference works and that&#39;s how these is no time exists at the centre.

In fact photons DO get stretched, the redshifting is NOT due to the doppler effect! Doppler shifts are caused by an object\u2019s motion through space, whereas a cosmological redshift is caused by the expansion of space. In Hubble\u2019s law, the original interpretation of redshifts was that they were due to Doppler shifts by receding galaxies; this works because for small redshifts, the Doppler shift can account for the recession of galaxies in expanding space. However, the full properties of expanding space, described by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, must be taken into account for larger redshifts. In fact, at redshifts (z) greater than about 1.5, galaxies are observed with recessional velocities greater than the speed of light!

Same with the observer in the accelerating spaceship. Their time is slowing down as it accelerates thus changing how they perceive the photon who is always at the same speed. The outside observer, on the other hand, are stationary compared to the source of the photon thus are not affected by shifting of their own time which remains the same thus why they see the photon inside the spaceship as non-changing.

If you say that space expands, giving it a definition whereby a specific geometry or grid is assigned to divide its volume into sections, then mass must also conform to that grid of measurement. But you&#39;re saying the opposite. You are defining a realm of existence, one that matter does not have to conform to. Doesn&#39;t that strike you as...odd? Mathematics yields an expected result based on repeated observations, but they cannot tell you WHAT is going on, and so you always end up guessing without evidence.<br><br>Observations can mislead you, no differently then how the observers of the past witnessed ships falling over the edge of the earth - because that&#39;s what it looked like to them. At LEAST they had that going for them - the fact that they were describing something they observed the best way they knew how. And yet, scientific observations SCREAM a very round, nonhomogeneic and anisotropic universe, and yet cosmology has fought tooth and nail AGAINST what they were seeing simply because they did not like the implications of it.<br><br>The flat earthers could even write equations to describe how long it would take for a ship to completely disappear, and from that calculate how fast the water was flowing over the edge, assuming that the ship was not under power, and so on. There are only two differences between cosmology and flat earth theory: one is that cosmologists say that the ocean and every unseen thing inside of it was expanding between the observer and the ship, without that expansion affecting the ship and the observer, so as to yield a measurable result; the other is that where flat earthers claim the earth is flat, cosmologists claim that the UNIVERSE is flat. That&#39;s quite convenient, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s about as convenient as Lorentz&#39;s contraction of length was in the day of Michelson and Morley.

When talking cosmological scales you hint at the GR definition of expansion. Explicitly, this is the divergence of 4-space in terms of scale, the distance between 3-space points moving forward in time does not increase in the transitional sense, rather the energy density decreases. This results in a change in the relationship between space and time that looks like an increase in distances if the rate of advancement through time is assumed to be constant.<br><br>However, when talking about classical scales you imply that expansion takes on the traditional definition of something stretching, like a balloon expanding. Though your conclusion that expansion does not occur on these scales is correct, your reasoning implies that the fundamental effect does not apply either, this is incorrect. Since it is scale that changes, not true 3-space distances, expansion would not have the kind of effects you describe. Atoms would not stretch apart, the short but complicated reason is that the maxwell equations exhibit conformal invariance; basically the electromagnetic forces in atoms would accommodate the relative scale change. As with all GR effects, they are essentially transparent to the local observer, and since we are necessary collocated with ourselves, we wouldn&#39;t notice if we expanded.<br><br>That being said, our local energy density it too high for 4-space divergence.

Before you dismiss this idea, please let me complete the explanation.  Light travels as a transverse wave similar to ocean waves.  For a moment let\u2019s compare a tsunami event to redshift.  As a long low amplitude wave moves through the deep ocean it travels fast and as it reaches shallow shores the wave slows, shortens and gains amplitude because the earth under the water is pushing the wave upward toward the wave if you will.  Now to reach earth, light from a far galaxy must travel for billions of years through space passing by an untold number of gravitational sources that produce a perpendicular force on the light as it passes through the gravitational fields.  Since the light is not polarized and the gravity sources would come from all sides of the light, the gravity would produce the opposite effect that land\u2019s influence on a tsunami waves would produce.

In the doppler effect observed in sound waves, the observer is moving respect the emission point, so the distance between the emitting and the receptor is changing in fact, but the spatial dimension remains at the same scale, so the wavelength of the sound wave is being stretched or elongated, respect that linear dimension. We can talk about changes in wavelength.<br><br>But if we are talking about an expanding universe that means the expansion of space containing it, the 3 dimensions of space are being elongated at the same time, so, the wavelength of radiation remains the same related to that three dimensions, so the change of wavelength observed cannot be interpreted as a change in the scale of space itself.

The photon is a structure made of magnetic field in empty space, and this structure at a given frequency is defined by an inverse length parameter \u03b1. I will now say that the length is typically the wavelength \u03bb (~ 1/\u03b1 ~ c/\u03bd). So \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 the photon occupies a volume of the order V ~ \u03bb**3.

I believe there is some type of a linkage in the sense of classical physics, but I have no specific ideas in this regard thus far. For now just accept this proposition which should not be found too objectionable: Whatever the photon-makeup of light is, it must always hold for ligh to remain light.

At greater distances there is not enough energy available for photons to exist in a connected continuum. The light-photon linkage fails when the intensity falls below a threshold.<br><br>PHOTON BANDWIDTH \u0394\u03bd<br><br>The bandwidth \u0394\u03bd which we are forced to introduce above is in fact exactly what is called for from any view of the photon as a free-standing magnetic structure. Consider (in principle) translating such an isolated structure at the velocity c past a light detector connected to a suitably fast oscilloscope. Then an electromagnetic pulse will be recorded \u2013 a pulse which begins at zero amplitude and ends in zero amplitude. When this time-domain pulse is fed to a spectrum analyzer or is digitally transformed, one obtains its corresponding frequency spectrum. This gives the dominant frequency \u03bd and the badwidth \u0394\u03bd.<br><br>WHAT HAPPENS NOW?<br><br>Driven by the light-photon linkage \u201cmechanism\u201d the light spontaneously moves to lower frequencies and maintains the condition (3).

The most plausible guess is that the part of the universe we observe appears homogenous, but it is, in fact, not.  Most likely, larger gravitational clusters outside our &quot;pocket&quot; are distributively tugging on our view at all points, relatively smoothly.

The misconception that perplexes most physicists is that space is some form of Euclidean Geometry where time is a dissociative attribute.  In reality, space and time do not exist without each other and the expansion of space-time is visible in everything you see - electromagnetic radiation is proof that the &quot;Big Bang&quot; is an ongoing process.  The idea that the Big Bang was merely a moment in the past is complete non-sense: there was no space or time before the Big Bang and there is no &#39;present&#39; time without expanding space. When I see any light source, I realize that photons do not accelerate from 0 to C (the speed of light) instantaneously; rather, light IS propagated by the relativistic expansion of space-time itself.<br><br>As for material objects, the perception of permanence is merely an illusion.  Just touch your own skin and you will find that you radiate heat. In fact, every atom in your body is in perpetual motion with electron clouds that surround nuclei in a constant state of quantum flux.  Without the expansion of space-time, the forces that hold material objects together would cause an instantaneous collapse resulting in micro-miniature black holes.<br><br>In reality, at an atomic level, both you and I are mostly empty expanding space with forces and energies (that cannot exist without the expansion of space-time) that would literally become zero without the flow of time.  On the quantum level, space-time is quite different, but that&#39;s a discussion for another post.<br><br>One last thought to ponder: the acceleration which we feel and attribute to gravity IS the direct result of the relativistic differential of space-time in which the presence of matter decreases the volumetric expansion (which results in acceleration vectors) of space-time at the quantum level. If the density of matter increases to the point that quantum flux is disallowed than time and space collapse and we have the birth of a black hole.<br><br>In other words, we can all feel the expansion of space-time and we call it gravity: and we can all see the expansion of space-time and we call that light.

We know that the expanding universe is energy driven (hence - dark energy).  This is undeniably true because increasing the distance between objects increases the gravitational potential energy.   Energy is force times distance so this dark energy manifests its self as a force.  Orbits are not in equilibrium.

In order for the detectors in the rocket to \u201dsee\u201d the photons they need to absorb/consume the photon, because you can not \u201dsee\u201d a photon passing by, you can only detect it by consuming it. So the external observers can never \u201dsee\u201d the photon from their point of view, because they would need to be in the direct path of the photon, so they will need to be in the same place as the observers in the rocket. There is no outside observing point at the same time with the inside the rocket view point. The external view point is only an imagined view point. So I think the thought experiment is misleading from the start, because it is never possible to perpendicularly \u201dsee\u201d a photon, that is just our imagination imagining how it would look like, but no one can really see that photon from a distance. There is no way of observing a photon other than by consuming/absorbing it.

If this is the case , then it should be easier for the universe to introduce new space into areas with less bound objects .

Yes exactly. Therefore, the radiation from them becomes redder (the frequency of the light falls). The fact is that in accordance with general relativity, the speed of time depends on the magnitude of the gravitational potential. The higher it is - the time flows more slowly. And in the early universe, which was more dense, gravity was higher. Therefore, the time then (if compare with the current moment) went slower. How much? Well for the most distant galaxies, we get the redshift about 10. Therefore, time passed 10 times slower. And since the times recombination (when the relic radiation appeared) Universe expanded 1100 times, therefore time accelerated 1100 times. There is a direct linear dependence on the scale factor.<br>\r<br>So the cosmological redshift is GRAVITATIONAL\r redshift!!!<br><br>The video showed that the gravitational redshift disappears for a free falling observer.

The aspect of a photon that it has mass slightly increases, the energy aspect slightly decreases. That expresses itself in a longer wavelength, partly because the photon then has a minuscule inertia that resists the undulating wave effect, and also because part of its energy has become mass and so it&#39;s less energetic. We don&#39;t yet have the instruments to detect the tiny mass of photons, but proof of its existence can be found in every experiment that purports to prove general relativity using the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation. Light &#39;bends&#39; around massive stellar objects because it&#39;s attracted to them through gravity. All galaxies are enveloped by a shell of photons that are far enough away to have acquired a little mass, but still close enough for that great collective mass to have an effect on the peripheral stars, an effect that has been observed and explained with the invented &#39;dark matter&#39;.

Are electrons on the surfaces of all matters a fact? Is the line of sight electrons repel each other with Coulomb&#39;s force a fact?\r<br>\r<br>This repulsion force is the conductor of radiation and induction. It works like an invisible body less massless rigid rod between matters.\r<br>\r<br>When surface electrons oscillating at the radius direction, they carry oscillating longitudinal electrostatic force/radiation/radiant energy/EM wave/photon. The repulsion force between the line of sight matters causes surface electrons to oscillate at the same frequency simultaneously. This is the mechanism of light. \r<br>\r<br>When surface electrons moving forth and back in one of the parallel conductors, they carry oscillating parallel electrostatic force. The repulsion force works as the friction causes electrons on other conductors to move forth and back simultaneously. This is the mechanism of induction.\r<br>\r<br>Hold a strong magnet in each hand, the same pole faces each other. If you move one hand in and out, the other hand will move in the same direction simultaneously, this is magnetic force radiation.

Here is why. Frequency and time-period are inversely related. Red-shift (change in frequency of photon) is related to time-dilation (change in time-period of the photon). Doppler vs. Gravitational red-shifts can be accurately predicted based on velocity vs. gravitational time-dilation. Former is quantified in Special Relativity (SR) and latter in General Relativity (GR) and are not that closely related. e.g. Equivalence Principle has some limitations. e.g. Acceleration does not curve space-time as much as mass-energy/gravitation does when you actually quantify it. This is why you cannot derive the time-dilation equations from each other. SR/GR have not been unified and are also not in conflict since only one of them applies in the presence/absence of acceleration/gravity on observers (inertial vs. non-inertial frames). Universe expands at 70 km/s between 2 points 1 Mpc (Mega-ParSec) apart. Cosmological red-shift is closer to explain using doppler red-shift but Gravitational red-shift when quantified accurately cannot be explained by doppler red-shift through transformation of co-ordinates / switching to accelerating observer. This is why gravitationally bound systems (objects in a galaxy) move closer, but galaxies themselves recede from each other due to weak gravitational force across such massive distances.

If you don&#39;t believe me, go to the website for WMAP.  They insist that (1) is the <b>wrong</b> concept of expansion.  And of course they contradict themselves royally, since they announced, after years of observations, that the universe is flat, which per se is okay with me;  but it contradicts the very basis of their theory of cosmic background microwave, which states that the reason we still see that radiation from the big bang is that the light has been going around the universe (while stretching) and coming to our eyes after the round trip;  but that would imply that the universe is closed, which it cannot be as well as being flat.

Imagine there are two E-M sources-detectors with the initial distance between them long enough to stretch the wavelength of photons they emit (~400 nm in the beginning) by, let&#39;s say, 0.1 nm (through expansion of the space - they are motionless relatively to each other in terms of kinetics, only the space is expanding). Now one of them emits a 400 nm photon that costs him some energy equal to E. The second one, after quite a time, receives a 400.1 nm photon, gaining energy equal to x*E where x&lt;1. Then he sends a photon back but all he can afford is a 400.1 nm one and his counterpart receives roughly a 400.2 nm photon (or even 400.2-400.3? The space has expanded so the comebacking photon has a longer way to go through so the expansion effect affects him longer) which he absorbs, gaining y*E energy in the proces where y&lt;x.

After falling the building height, he passes the photon emitor significantly faster, so doppler effect should blue shift the emited photon from blue to UV.

Mass expanding with the universe is what is responsible for the emergent trait that is gravity. The energy of the mass creates a slightly faster local expansion( not really even local), you are not pulled towards the mass but instead simply rest in free fall until the larger mass catches up. This effect if very tiny and essentially not noticeable because when your ruler expands with the object you are attempting to measure it becomes impossible to measure a change in size. If we step outside the typical dimensions it starts to become more clear when you simulate this expansion in 4 or more dimensions. The entire thing can give us a whole new perspective on what energy is to start with as current definition leaves a lot to be desired.

As they pass through each gas cloud, charged field, galactic halo, etc, the photons inevitably collide with other photons just ever so slightly as to change their spin. This can result in the photon losing some of its angular momentum and having outer layers of spin stripped off, the longer it has to travel, the more fields that resist it, the more angular momentum it loses. This is especially true for very energetic photons like an X-ray, it is spinning at such a frequency that it is basically taking the most violent belligerent path possible. An X-ray is short lived because the likelihood it will collide with an atom, an electron or another photon is so high - if a photon gets absorbed and re-emitted from a proton or electron it will come out quantized at a lower frequency, categorically.   So the further the source is, the more fields a photon passes through, the more that bluer photons are stripped out, and spun down into lower frequencies which are much more predictable and simple in their path. Redder photons have the least surface area, their wavelength is basically like a long line with a slight curve rather than a billion oscillations per second, so these redder photons are able to pass through relatively unscathed.

I will never understand it. Because what does stretching a photon even mean. A wave can be stretched, but a particle? Also how are waves particles? Do we know how that even equates, never mind stretching whatever it is. Enlighten me please. Also, why is dark matter not just space-time that is diluted? For instance in the overall area of a rotating spiral galaxy. How would that affect t spin speed at the edge? And if it cannot be seen like that, then how would the dark matter be visualised to account for spin. It seems that even on these high-level constructs we don&#39;t understand anything, and yet we want to discuss string theory? I mean einstein is non-intuitive, but at some level Newtonian thinking would have broken down by itself in certain situations. But string theory and the wave-particle duality seem to hint at an altogether different truth that we are just not seeing.  Have there been any tests to see if the universe we live in could be algorithmic like a hologram whatever that means, but basically that it;s run by laws that are constrained by the same laws that govern other artificial systems (an example from a stupid person like me would be maybe finding that true randomness was not common in nature, or that objects in a system have boundary conditions within which they can communicate(for example a limit to signalling distance within the system, or the build-up of information in the system in a non-random ratio so that the amount of information is always increasing etc etc.) these are stupid ideas by me, but I think you get the gist, are scientists looking at this?  Also, are they maybe looking at the repercussions of the fact that the standard model maybe just does not fit, and that&#39;s that. What then. Could we have test cases for the universe if that was the case? No fancy graviton. No grand theories... How would we test for that. Instead of testing for the reverse?

Photons loose EM Kinetic Dipoles over time and Energy is lost with each dipole.  As Photons loose EM Kinetic Dipoles it looses energy, expands in volume, and &quot;Redshifts&quot;.   The Hubble Constant is the rate that Photons shed EM dipoles.<br><br>As Photons (and particles) travel through different regions of space they encounter EM Kinetic Dipole Density changes that compress and decompress Photons as they pass through varying EM Dipole density regions.  <br><br>This compression causes Photon volume to decrease causing &quot;blueshift&quot; and the decompression causes Photons to increase in volume causing &quot;redshift&quot;. <br><br>The CMB is just the microwaves from Photons that redshifted past max photon wavelength which is in the microwave range.  The Photons have traveled far enough to lose enough dipoles to expand and literally fall apart.  The CMB microwaves are from the dipoles momentum as the photons fell apart and hit the EM field dipoles which continues to propagate the wave like a radio wave.  Radio waves are not Photons, they are dipole density compression and polarity waves. <br><br>This is the simplest and most accurate description of &quot;quantum gravity&quot; their is on the street.  Planet for that matter!<br><br>Electromagnetic Kinetic Dipole Theory describes the actual constituent parts of what everyone calls the Electromagnetic field.  Quantum Gravity or TTOE uses &quot;Superfluid Vacuum Theory&quot; to describe how a &quot;Bose Gas of Solid Kinetic Dipoles&quot; forms the Electromagnetic field.   Quantum Superfluid in particles is a Bose Einstein Condensate of trillions of EM Kinetic Dipole Particles.  <br><br>EM Kinetic Dipoles carry all Momentum.  <br><br>Their are ~22 micrograms of EM kinetic Dipoles in the Vacuum your human body currently occupies.  These dipoles are hitting you at an RMS speed of &quot;c&quot;, the speed of light.  Some faster than &quot;c&quot; and some slower than &quot;c&quot;.  Blame Maxwell / Boltzmann...  Each time you are hit by a dipole momentum is transferred to your dipoles in your particles.  You accelerate.  Gravity.<br><br>I am very specifically saying that the EM Dipole (that flows out of North and into South) is an actual solid particle shaped like a tri-pyramidal Prince Rupert&#39;s Drop (quickly frozen rain drop shape, perhaps after the Big Bang if you believe in that).  The Kinetic Dipole has &quot;more mass/inertia&quot; on the &quot;North / Positive&quot; end. It is roughly 1x10^-120 meters in length.  They have Planck Density.  Not only does this Bose Gas form the EM Field, you quickly realize that their natural kinetic collisions off each others surface area describes all EM Field and Wave laws , and yes Gravity to.  <br><br>While flowing through a &quot;sea of dipoles&quot; EM Kinetic Dipoles change direction and typically turn toward higher dipole density fields due to drag.  This is Coalescence and Gravity and Refraction and Diffraction.  Dipole Momentum Redirection describes all experiments, double slit, prisms, the variable index of refraction of vacuum dipoles that causes &quot;gravitational lensing&quot;...  all of it...<br><br>The force of Gravity, dipole collision momentum transfer,  is proportional to the slope (gradient) of the Dipole Mass Density at a point in space and how the dipole collisions transfer momentum to your Particle EM Dipoles (Matter) .   <br><br>The shape of the Kinetic Dipole governs the &quot;laws of nature&quot;.  The North ends rounded shape is governed by the sqrt(ln(x)) and the South/Negative end &quot;tails&quot; off with a combo of e^-(x^2) and e^-(x^3).  Collisions off a kinetic object with this profile defines all natural laws including how these dipoles naturally vortex about one another to form &quot;fluids and particles&quot;.  The Effective Cross Section of the EM Kinetic Dipole (relative to the head to tail length of 1) is the Fine Structure Constant.   <br><br>Some day soon I am releasing a series of short papers that will &quot;in detail&quot; describe the theory.

Or more accurately, one can describe spacetime as pulling things apart with some force. Just choose another coordinate system (say a static coordinate system such as ds^2=(1-k^2*r&#39;^2)dt&#39;^2-dr&#39;^2/(1-k^2*r&#39;^2)-dOmega^2 instead of the comoving frame ds^2=dt^2-a^2(t)*(dr^2+dOmega^2). Then the cosmological constant is providing a force pulling everything away from the origin of the coordinate system (r=0) with a force proportional to distance from said origin. Such force would be akin to a cosmological Coriolis force (in mathematical origin, meaning it arises due to the choice of the coordinate system), except that it does not arise from spining but from the existence of the cosmological constant.<br><br>Yet, one would still not be expanding but expanded. Indeed, molecules, planets, stars and every compound object strong enough to old itself together despite the cosmological constant would be ever so slightly bigger than if there where no cosmological constant. But this size expansion would be finite (and quite practically unmeasurable currently), meaning things are bigger but not getting biggerrer over time.<br><br>That&#39;s the trouble with general relativity (or rather any theory obeying general covariance) because any physical interpretation of what is happening is very much dependent on how one mathematically describes the system. In the first case, the cosmological constant is quite litterally pulling things appart with a force while spacetime itself is static (i.e. not expanding) in the second, spacetime is expanding and anything embedded in it is just following it&#39;s local patch of space with no external force applied on it. Yet both description are identical as one can easily change from one description to the other (given the coordinate change is known).<br><br>What coordinate system is best to use just depends on what observable one wants to compute/compare to measurements. For instance, there is nothing wrong (neither mathematically nor physically) in saying the earth is static at the center of the universe and everything else is moving around it. But if you want to compute the trajectories of other planets in the solar system or some random star in or outside our galaxy in that coordinate system then good luck. Best to use a more appropriate coordinate system to do the computation of the trajectory and translate into earth coordinates later.", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T16:59:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SIVAH.

That is if an object is stationary at 0 unit of space per 1 unit of time, the stretching, or scaling, of space-time, will not change that; it is still 0 unit of space no matter how big space is. I think this is the main misconception why people think that everything is expanding. Space-time is a strange fabric that is infinitely elastic, as you &quot;stretch&quot; it out like a balloon, the individual grid point doesn&#39;t stretch with it but it still pushes everything out. This is why it can be stretched indefinitely and not tear from expansion.

If we use SR in this 4th spatial dimension we find that the infinitely small and infinitely large points  are moving away at speed of C. <br> The galaxies at the edge of observable universe moving away at C and red shifted and also the smallest point is collapsing on itself at C.. giving infinite energy at every point in space.  Indeed each end of this dimension can tied together in a 4D mobius strip where energy lost at the edge of the universe is balanced by quantum fluctuations in quantum realm.<br>Anyhow the important point here is that I see cosmological expansion, doppler and gravitational curvature being equivalent here.

At the same instant the rocket accelerates, the photon takes off as per the video. When the photon gets to the middle of the ship to have its redshift measured, the ship is going faster than it was when the light was emitted ???!!! ... How so? <br>In order to move ... the floor in the center of the rocket must be notified to accelerate ... by a force sent through the hull to that central floor. The implication of the video is that the &quot;notice of acceleration&quot; is sent instantaneously through the ship. However, that notice cannot possibly exceed the velocity of light and so arrives at the central floor ... after ... the light to be measured arrives. It arrives -after-, because the light travels a straight line whereas the &quot;notice to accelerate&quot; must move (at light velocity) to the sides of the ship, then up those sides, then back to the center of the middle floor which is a longer path. In the example in the video, the central floor is still &quot;at rest&quot; when the photon arrives to have its red shift measured so it can&#39;t possibly have changed.<br>This introduces the relativistic compression of an extended body by linear acceleration (which is absent from radial accelerations except as a static compression as in standing on the surface of the earth). Or, the elongation of an extended body ... if ... the engine is pulling the ship from the front instead of pushing from the rear. This simple principle is &quot;relativistic&quot; because it involves the speed of light ... but isn&#39;t recognized by physics as far as I know. It is also the chief causal factor in Bremsstrahlung radiation since the compression-elongation is cumulative (dependent on the total time of the acceleration) ... and the energy radiated is dependent on the stored available energy with respect to the time available for photon formation ... which is, in turn, dependent on wave-length-. <br>The difference between radial and linear accelerations should have been put forward as an explanation of the stability of the electron in a Bohr orbit back in the 19th century.

In other words, just because you walk from your living room to the bedroom doesn&#39;t mean your house has expanded. But all the universe&#39;s matter, clusters, nebulae, quasars, galaxies, etc. are rotating around a common gravitational center at different speeds, exactly the same as our planets circle around our sun and our galaxy circles around a black hole. But everything moving in space moves in different directions relative to their gravitational system at different speeds, just like the planets and &quot;moons&quot;, comets and asteroids in our solar system do. So, something that appears redshifted would be the equivalent/similar to planets orbiting the sun at different speeds. Therefore, sometimes planets come closer to each other and other times appear to be traveling apart and away from each other.

From looking into this now, it seems that remote stars aren&#39;t actually moving away from us. If you took a yardstick and measured the distance to a remote star, then waited a billion years and measured it again, the distance would almost be the same, except for sone minor actual velocity difference because the yardstick is expanding also. The red shift is happening because space is expanding while the light is traveling, not because of any relative velocity difference.  The red shift is expressed using velocity because expanding space is hard to wrap your mind around.

At familiar scales that differential would be immeasurably small. Btt an extremely large fixed volume should then have a measurable and useful pressure differential between its insides and outsides that can be used to generate usable energy, indefinitely.<br><br>Equivalently, two opposite sides of a large fixed volume (a physical enclosure, like a cosmic-scale dyson sphere) should feel each other constantly accelerated toward each other, as the forces binding them together change their inertial motion that would lead them to drift apart with the expansion of space. Consequently, they should <b>each</b> see each other as &quot;lower&quot; in a &quot;gravity well&quot; than the other, and so light from each should appear blue-shifted to the other. Meaning a photon absorbed by one side and re-emitted to the other side who then does the same in return should get higher and higher in energy with each bounce (just like a particle bouncing around inside a shrinking sphere would do) ... allowing some of that energy to be siphoned off with each bounce without retarding the process, allowing the extraction of useful energy, indefinitely.<br><br>This is how civilizations can survive the heat death of the universe. Cosmic-scale structures extracting dark energy from the perpetual expansion of the universe, forever.<br><br>And before you say there&#39;s no way any material could survive the forces on a scale like that: if we took all the matter in the galaxy and smeared it out into a shell at just the right distance from the central supermassive black hole, the force of gravity pulling it all back in on itself and the force of dark energy pulling it apart would exactly counterbalance, leaving an effectively gravity-free surface across which there would be no huge gravitational forces tearing apart the structure you want to build there. Then just make the structure a little bit bigger, so that dark energy is just barely winning, trying to pull it apart, but not beyond the threshold that materials can withstand.

This implies ejection of protogalaxies.\r<br>2) The youngest objects appear to have the highest redshifts. This implies that intrinsic redshift decreases as the object ages.\r<br>3) As distance from the ejecting central object increases, the quasars increase in brightness and decrease in redshift. This implies that the ejected objects evolve as they travel outward.\r<br>4) At about z= .3 and about 400 kpc from that parent galaxy the quasars appear to become very bright in optical and X-ray luminosity. This implies there is a transition to BL Lac Objects.\r<br>5) Few BL Lac objects are observed implying this phase is short-lived.\r<br>6) Clusters of galaxies, many of which are strong X-ray sources, end to appear at comparable distances to the BL Lac&#39;s from the parent galaxy. This suggests the clusters may be a result of the breaking up of a BL Lac.\r<br>7) Clusters of galaxies in the range z= .4 to .2 contain blue, active galaxies. It is implied that they continue to evolve to higher luminosity and lower redshift.\r<br>8) Abell clusters from z= .01 to .2 lie along ejection lines from galaxies like CenA. Presumably they are evolved products of the ejections.\r<br>9) The strings of galaxies which are aligned through the brightest nearby spirals have redshifts z= .01 to .02. Presumably they are the last evolutionary stage of the ejected protogalaxies before they become slightly higher redshift companions of the original ejecting galaxies.", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T02:58:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philipp Berry", "comment_text": "I wonder how many of the 3.1k so far comments are repeating the same joke.", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T02:57:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "idroppedmypocket", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve been watching you for a long, long time.

If you had an object made of atoms and molecules moving through the ship, the outside observers could detect light reflecting off the object and passing through a window and measure its frequency, but photons do not interact with each other in this way. So if you have a photon moving from a source back of the ship to a detector at front of the ship, what is it even supposed to mean for an observer outside the ship to observe it? They are not in the path of the photon. They can&#39;t see light (more photons) reflected off the original photon. You could have a source emitting photons of the same wavelength in all directions and the observers measuring the wavelength of photons that travel towards them, but veritasium specifically talks about &quot;the same photon&quot; looking green and blue to different observers.

Technically some such surveys have found that perpendicular to that apparent axis of maximum acceleration there may potentially even be decelerating like scientists had expected but the errors on measurements aren&#39;t food enough to accurately assess that due to the smaller sample sizes from splitting the data into bins.  On the other hand measurements which do assume homogeneity averaging over the whole sky find values around what the Nobel prize winning team did in the 1990s.

So imagine a field covered in balls that are packed together in an flat plane - no gaps between them.  Now imagine that every ball slowly shrinks at the same rate, but doesn&#39;t move.  The distance between the balls would appear to increase to an observer that is on a single ball shrinking with it.  And since every tape measure and ruler and scientific device on each little ball is also shrinking, any measurements of distance made would be locally consistent to any given ball, but show an increase in distance between the balls.  And finally....imagine that the universe began not as a point singularity, but as an evenly distributed uniform energy field that is exactly the same size as it is now, but the field of energy began slowly bleeding into another dimension at every point in space.  The energy field would cool off and condense into matter, the matter starts to clump together, the clumps stay more or less in place but keep shrinking, then continues to shrink for the rest of time as the energy bleeds away.  As an observer on one of those clumps, it would look like they were staying the same size, the universe was expanding, the other clumps are getting farther away, and it all began with a distance of zero.

So in the Harvard Tower or in the rocket, the original blue photon could not be absorbed by an atom anymore (to the same energy level)?

Instead of expanding space, we could see it as shrinking matter. Instead of the Big Bang, we started with the Big Collapse. As you said, on a nearby scale the space/time bending of gravitational forces, as well as the other nearby forces, make sure that the shrunken matter retains their relative positions towards each others, resulting in the &quot;expanding space&quot; in between galaxies. Basically the shrinking and expanding theory is similar, just from a different perspective.<br><br>What I find intriguing about shrinking matter though, is that it provides a different approach as to &quot;why&quot; this occurs. Instead of a &quot;force&quot; that pushes everything outwards, we could look at mechanisms inside elementary particles. Perhaps our bosons go through a process where their spatial dimensional properties collapse. This could also be a periodical process, as much else is in nature. So that after a certain point in time matter stops collapsing  and start bulging again. In such a way the universe could stretch the spatial dimensions and time dimension, by means of collapsing matter, and then return to &quot;bang&quot; point, as a wave function.", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T21:16:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lord Queezle", "comment_text": "...a very scientific yo mama joke...", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T21:16:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rutvik Panchal", "comment_text": "Alternative title : explaining how Thanos&#39; snap works", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T21:16:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip Otey", "comment_text": "Daft!

Photons emitted from a common source radiate spherically outward in all directions. Those photons intercepted by any particular observer can never be intercepted by any other observer.

The big logical flaw behind this concept is that over 3 billion years of distance that a photon of light would travel from a galaxy 3 billion light years away, they light would diminish very quickly in relative terms since the redshifting would have occurred for 3 billion years. No photons would get very far, especially when the claim of this nonsense is that the universe is expanding at greater than the speed of light. Any redshifting that would occur would occur at the point of light being generated for as long as it is in the useful distance of a gravitational field. i.e, the light would leave the gravitational field redshifted and remain redshifted.

Right at the end, you mention dark energy.   But dark energy is not required to explain an expanding universe.   It is only used to explain acceleration in the expansion.   Does that change your last conclusion?   On another matter, I just recently read a nice paper on how cosmic dust can perfectly explain away the acceleration and eliminate the dark energy theory.   Basically, the dust scatters away some of the observed photons from distant type 1A supernovae, so they are a bit closer than their observed intensity leads us to believe.  In that case, their observed red shift matches their modified distance with constant expansion, as opposed to accelerating expansion.   I like the charts and graphs in the paper, but I haven\u2019t yet waded through the mathematics.  Here is a link:   <a href=\"https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjp-2015-0732\">https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjp-2015-0732</a> <br>I also like that dust is a much simpler explanation than dark energy.  I thought of the dust idea some 20 years ago, but didn\u2019t find a good paper on it until recently.  This is not my field of study; I just am casually interested in cosmology.  One last comment:  I\u2019ve emailed this question to various astronomers over the years and have never gotten any response.  It makes me think that dust earns far less research dollars than dark energy.  But I\u2019m biased a little cynical by default.   I really hope that you have a response, even if it is to point me to a paper that proves it isn\u2019t dust.

And the richness of the effects, animations and discourse is really amazing... but in the scope of an explanatory video this does the opposite of what it&#39;s trying to do, and leaves you with more questions and confusion than you started. There&#39;s simply too much &quot;fluff&quot; that really doesn&#39;t add or are helpful at all for answering the question, if anything it does the opposite... at least in my eyes.

It&#39;s the space between them, that is expanding and sort of &quot;pushing&quot; them away from each other, rather than &quot;stretching&quot; them apart.<br><br>Q: Then why are photons red-shifting?<br>A: Wavelength is an emergent property dependent on the time and space <i>around</i> the photon - the photon itself doesn&#39;t change, the (apparent) wavelength does depending on the reference frame.<br><br>I hope this doesn&#39;t sound as taking these videos too much for granted, again I know he pours countless hours into content like this and I give my full support.

It is easier to understand if you describe the 4D material world nested within a Hilbert vector space of infinite dimensionality in which the wave function  is made manifest.  Whithin this hilbert space lies all possible realities simultaneously.  A point of reference or &quot;locality&quot; is required for a specific plane of coherence or thread of causality to manifest.  This is why an &quot;observer&quot; is fundamental for experiential reality.  When an observer makes a measurement (i.e is conscious), they are discovering their own locality within the hilbert space, and likewise in the 4D material world.... Or more precisely where they were since consciousness lags slightly behind the present moment due to the time it takes the brain to process information and construct the low-res representation of the wave function that we experience as reality.  Since consciousness is also a quantum process in superposition, it cannot predict precisely what state it will be in the instant after it makes a measurement.  It has its own future probability cone that conicides with the rest of the universe.   <br><br>If we could see the real hilbert space, when we look up at the moon, we wouldn&#39;t see a large mass drifting through the night sky, but rather a set of point vectors with changing values as &quot;time&quot; (causality) progresses.  Those vector points are intrinsically linked to every other thought the infinite vector space, so as the moon moves through the night sky, the values of the vector points thought the entire universe (and multiverse) change as well (with a greater change occurring closet to the reference object, and infinitely small changes at infinite distances from the object but reaching a point of neglible practicable effect).  Our brains represent these infinite changes as 3d objects of mass, or forces, or energy etc etc.    There are simply too many variables within the hilbert space (infinitely variable) for a substrate such as the brain to represent with 1 to 1 accuracy.   Much of modern theoretical physics  is actually sperating the illusion that our brains produce from the actuality of the wave function.  Our brains were designed by evolution to hide the truth about reality so that we could focus on what we need to survive and reproduce.... And it did so with a priority on reducing energy consumption so that the rest of the organism is still able to function effectively.  Science has demonstrated time and time again that what we experience is a low-res, low energy, illusory but functional representation.... Yet we still refuse to believe it.   There is good reason for this.  It would not aid in our survival if we doubted everything our senses and brains tell us, and we would meet be able to process unfiltered reality.  Evolution provided us a gui that we can use, and the unquestionable belief that it is true so that we would use it.<br><br>Now many will scoff at this and think that I&#39;m saying that the world would not exist without consciousness... No, there are an infinite number of taurus within the wave function that do not have conscious entities, and 99.999999999999% of the timeline within our own realities timeline there is no conscious observer (singularity &quot;beginning&quot; and thermal equilibrium &quot;ending&quot;).   But who cares about infinite universes that have no consciousness?  The only reason we care about this one is because we are conscious.    Consciousness has no bearing on the reality of the wave function itself... But it is vital for us to learn anything about our own world...

My understanding based on the video is that a photon has some amount of energy, but the energy that we measure (which is related to the wavelength/frequency) is not necessarily the energy that the photon actually has. The way that I am thinking of this is that the photon is like a ball, and the observer is like a scale. If the observer is moving away in the same direction as the ball when the measurement takes place (impact) it would register a lower force than if it was moving the opposite direction, for example. Is that a reasonable analogy to explain this from a conservation of energy perspective?
