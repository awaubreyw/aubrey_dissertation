I don&#39;t think this is at all a good explanation of the earth&#39;s crust.  The Earth&#39;s crust&#39;s primary component of the upper crust is mainly made of Olivine. Olivine under greater and greater pressures suddenly changes from one mineral to another.  During these sudden changes, Olivine can crack and where most of our earthquakes come from. The earth&#39;s crust is also filled with graphite from Ancheint life, and it is these deposits that allow the earth&#39;s crust to move.  It would be more prudent to think of the Earth&#39;s Crust as a few giant slabs of Asphalt sliding past one another.  Asphalt is not one solid piece of rock it is thousands and millions of pieces all stuck together and with the tremendous amount of pressure these pieces crack and move very very slowly.  It&#39;s the Olivine that cracks and breaks with tremendous pressure that causes the majority of earthquakes because it&#39;s too hard to just crack and move as the rest does yet when it suddenly changes from Olivine to Wadesleyite to Ringwoodite to Periclase, etc (just a loose example) we get the cracks, breaks, and earthquakes which allow the crust to keep moving.

Frankly, because we know that glass started its life as silicate - like from a beach - we should be starting with the benefit of a doubt.

What we have here is something that stuck very firmly in my mind in college: The stacking of molecules.  Liquid molecules often in motion, solids much less so, and the more efficiently stacked the molecules are, the more solid that solid IS.

Never the hub of the disc the glass is much thicker, so the glazier would grind a flange from both sides so that the glass would fit in the frame and would allow putty to hold it in the frame. This gave the appearance of  the glass flowing down to flow over the frame. You can judge this glass&#39;s age by how thick the edge is and the number of air bubbles present. This technique was used until the mid 19&#39;th century when the glass was blown into a steel mold to make a cylinder then the top and bottom of the bottle shape were cut off and it was scored down one side .

My observations in a 125-year-old farm house in Northern Illinois was that every pane in the original (old) part of the house was visibly thicker at the bottom of the pane. Your red herring about telescope lenses is easily explainable by the fact that telescopes are moved around a great deal, and are not left in one (vertical) position for decades on end. ALSO the lenses in telescopes are much, much thicker than window glass. The time it would take for a glass lens to flow would be approximately an eternity.

If someone tells you not to think of pandas it&#39;s much more likely that you&#39;re going to think of pandas.

So people with schiz think they&#39;re having a convo with someone; Picture this you place a thought in a hole in a wall and then whatever response you were/expecting thinking comes back out the hole, you think someone&#39;s talking back too you but it&#39;ss just the answer that your mind expect.

And they communicated the idea quite wrong. The answer of the correct question is not very easy. It depends on the kind of glass , conditions (temperature/stresses), distinction criteria of physical states and how one considers the rate of deform to be continuous and infinite. Therefore for many reasons solid glass is fluid and on the other hand sometimes it is not.

In a way it&#39;s almost an error of language, more so than an error of human understanding. In observing a scientific phenomenon that has yet to be in context with the &quot;common&quot; knowledge of the public, a scientist often uses words that are still very much too broad to really capture the essence of what is taking place, and so it really reflects on the curiosity of individuals. So much of science is simply compared to common knowledge, as a way of making it understandable, when any particular event is nearly always different from the others even if only in a small way. It&#39;s just always been so fascinating the level of development that certain sciences have evolved, and how the learning curves of the discipline are still very much completely unknown (to my knowledge). We all assume that there&#39;s a point beyond which any discovery is not really a huge step forward any longer. A point at which we essentially have &quot;understood&quot; what is in front of us.

As it absorbs energy, it only changes the percentage of gas vs liquid, and can&#39;t breach 100C in an equilibrium system until all the water has turned to steam.

They are not fun, they both have different approaches to presenting Science as it unfolds at every second of our waking lives in an attractive way. I never had a Science Teacher who would explain to me that the mantle of Earth was solid... with an extremely high viscosity so that, for a person&#39;s eyes it would look solid . I thought it would gradually turn more and more viscous as the pressure would increase near the outer core. . So, I infer that the outer core is less viscous than the mantle. The inner core is solid Iron. Probably it&#39;s not yet very clear due to the very viscous liquid outer core. There&#39;s friction and more to the North, way more, for all, of our life-span&#39;s sale you must have seen what I can only imagine, so far (my plans include a tremendous effort) but,eventually I&#39;ll get to go and hopefully live in your birth City. Or close... Anyway, I have always been told that the inner core is made of solid Iron. My question is how is it possible to know? I don&#39;t think that extremely powerful X-Rays or Gamma rays would do it. And IF there was an exact Center of the Earth, the pressure would be none. Anything in that point would be weightless Same mass around it and thus same gravitational pull in every direction. Professor Very de Grass Tassium.

As the Tg occurs over a range (compared with melt temperature Tm), and the fact that at the Tg there is no decrease in energy flux over temperature increase (indicating no phase change), the conclusion is that glass is, just like pitch and the molten magma, a liquid with an incredibly high viscosity. Just because we are unable to view it as flowing, it does not mean it is a solid.<br><br>Further to this, when glass is heated to temperatures below Tg, an energy flux versus increase in temperature will show the glass will NOT change phase, even though it begins to flow. If a solid were to flow, it MUST undergo a phase transition at the Tm, which would be reflected in an energy flux versus temperature plot. As glass will flow at higher temperatures without undergoing phase change, the conclusion is it is indeed a liquid, and not a solid.
