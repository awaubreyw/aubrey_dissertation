The people who chose this would not have been accounting for the tension force which accumulates exponentially as the cord is stretched which creates enough acceleration to counter act gravity.  They would be thinking the force from the cord works on a more linear acceleration pattern, starting when the cord becomes taught.", "comment_date": "2013-10-19T06:50:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GalacticSparrow", "comment_text": "If you want to get technical, the load on the jumper at this point is an impulse load. In other words, a very high loading over a very short amount of time due to rapid acceleration of static objects relative to the jumper (loose rope around the ankles, whipping motion of the rope). Placing an accelerometer on the jumper may show this very short but very high acceleration.", "comment_date": "2013-04-18T00:55:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonas Misund", "comment_text": "There is no additional acceleration, it is rather lower because the rope is starting to hold the jumper back.", "comment_date": "2013-03-11T14:05:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Syriel666", "comment_text": "I was wondering, at this point the accelaration of the jumper is not exactly 9.8m/s\u00b2 because of the additional accelaration due to the kinetic energy of the part of the rope that was not bow-taut at the time of the jump but was straining up to this point b (just as in your chain drop video 8/29/11). What is the ratio between the acceleration between the maximum acceleration and the acceleration here, when you account for the additional speed up?
