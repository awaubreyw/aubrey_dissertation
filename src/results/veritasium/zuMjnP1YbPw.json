If God has no mass, how was he able to interact matter and energy into the objects that we see around us?<br><br>2. If God indeed has mass (and thus able to shape our Universe) did he just pop into existence, create himself, or is there an even more powerful being that exists (and as such invalidating the claim that God is the ultimate creator)?<br><br>3. (Related to Q2.) Since God has the mass to interact with particles, and he created those particles that make up our Universe, why does that ring alarm bells in my head that reminds me of the fact that energy and matter cannot be created or destroyed?<br><br>4. Why can&#39;t we detect the presence of God through interacting with matter or energy?<br><br>5. Why were the holy books of antiquity written by men in a period when almost nothing was known about the world around us, for example why we get sick, why lightning occurs, or why we get auroras? Would a similar book written today be labelled as the imagination of an insane individual?<br><br>6. Where is YOUR PROOF that a God indeed exists? You&#39;ve never seen him, smelled him, touched him or heard him, so how do you know there is a God other than other people&#39;s words?<br><br>Oh and since I know the best counter-argument the religious love &quot;Why did the Big Bang create energy from nothing?&quot;, the answer is - we don&#39;t know. The mechanics of the Big Bang are not even remotely known today, and as such we only have theories. These theories match up with the currently accepted laws of everything (physics, thermodynamics, gravity, blah blah), unlike a God - which has many many incompatibilities, the main one that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.<br><br>Hope you enjoyed my rant, please contain your God-inspired keyboard warrior egos!", "comment_date": "2013-11-10T16:49:27Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Karim Lahlou", "comment_text": "I believe the entire universe was created in 6 days, according to Quran.", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T15:18:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NUMBUR 129", "comment_text": "God is gay", "comment_date": "2013-11-07T14:22:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "markpnw10", "comment_text": "How do you know that their even was a bang and how to old the earth is?
