This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD3k1hgbUXQ&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Even the thumbnail from this video has the typical picture of Einstein and a mushroom cloud.  E=mc2 has no more to do with nuclear energy than it does with any other energy.   Knowing E=mc2, in no way leads you to the mechanisms to convert or release energies.   Cavemen created fire (chemical energy) or threw objects (kinetic energy) without knowing E=mc2.  Nobody in the past  (and nobody today) could look at E=mc2 and use it as a roadmap to create/discover new mechanisms to convert/release new sources of energy.  Nobody waited for E=mc2  before they started playing around with atoms and splitting them.   Even after they started getting energy from nuclear reactions, they&#39;re not just going to stop at that point if they didn&#39;t know E=mc2.

When uranium splits through fission some neutrons are released immediately, these are called prompt neutrons, and others are released seconds to minutes later, these are called delayed neutrons. By operating a reactor so that is only critical, maintaining constant fission rate, with the contribution of delayed neutrons, changes in reactor power happen on a long enough time scale to be controlled. Additionally, reactors are designed to take advantage of physical processes and properties of material that provide feedback to reactor power.  For example, increasing power raises coolant temperature, which decrease coolant  density. Since commercial water cooled reactors also use water to slow down high energy neutrons to the ideal energy for causing fission, decreasing the density of the water also reduces the number of neutrons available to cause a new fission event.

However, for anyone who doesn\u2019t have a good understanding of nuclear power generation, its important to point out that in the case of a reactor core, this seemingly terrifying \u201cknife\u2019s edge\u201d, where too many neutrons can cause a nuclear explosion, isn\u2019t actually possible. There are two main reasons for this;<br><br>1) Fuel-grade Uranium is nowhere near enriched enough to sustain a runaway supercritical nuclear reaction that results in a nuclear explosion. Weapons-grade Uranium must be enriched to about 90% U-235 for a bomb to be possible. Fuel-grade Uranium is only enriched to around 3% U-235. Therefore, there just aren\u2019t enough fissionable nuclei present in a fuel rod for this to occur.<br><br>2) Nuclear fuel rods, by virtue of being shaped as elongated rods, have way too much surface area for neutrons to escape the fissile material before triggering too many more fissions. For this very reason, a bomb core has to be a near-perfect sphere in order for it to actually work (in addition to being above the supercritical mass for the Uranium or Plutonium used). So even if the Uranium in a reactor core were weapons-grade (it never would be), and even if the neutrons were perfectly moderated (slowed down to maximize the probability of triggering more fissions, and hence releasing more neutrons), the fact that the fuel rods are rods completely ruins any possibility of the core ever acting as a bomb (and thankfully so!).<br><br>Anyway, I just thought I\u2019d add this information just so that nobody gets the false idea that the knife\u2019s edge analogy means that nuclear power reactors are just one mistake away from being a potential nuke, which is impossible.", "comment_date": "2021-07-01T05:43:25Z", "likes_count": 1313}, {"comment_by": "Joy Welch", "comment_text": "The  fixed feeling temporally fix because eyelash strangely cough from a brief bathroom. silky, obscene impulse", "comment_date": "2021-06-30T22:43:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tight Wad", "comment_text": "Lightbulb took 10k tries, Einstein woulda taken 10......let him RIP and appreciate his contributions", "comment_date": "2021-06-30T03:05:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cylentstoner", "comment_text": "&quot;......is talking moonshine.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-06-28T15:40:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sufian _", "comment_text": "Maybe hey said that to protect the world.

So Einstein knew it could be done with protons, but remarked it was &quot;like shooting at birds at night with a shotgun, on a night were there are very few birds.&quot; You couldn&#39;t get your energy back. It was a lot like nuclear FUSION which of course we think WILL BE possible commercially without neutrons. It&#39;s just hard to compressed the number of &quot;birds.&quot; Einstein probably had a good idea of where the sun gets its energy even with no neutrons-- that had been guessed since 1920. He just didn&#39;t think people could compress things like we do now with our fusion machines.<br><br>Li-7 is a total aberration. There aren&#39;t  any other isotopes vulnerable to protons, and it doesn&#39;t produce protons, but well-bound alphas. Szilard had just read an article about the Cockcroft-Walton experiment and the various commentaries on it by Einstein, etc., but he knew about the just-discovered neutron (1932), and wondered if there any isotopes which, if hit by neutrons, would undergo a simple reaction to produce more. There aren&#39;t. Fission (the only reaction that does this) hadn&#39;t been discovered, yet. Szilard spent five years looking for the right light isotope until fission was discovered in 1938 and then he realized this might be the reaction he was looking for, if it only produced neutrons (nobody knew). Szilard got them to measure this, and voila!  Fission did produce excess neutrons. So then he knew.<br><br>The really big surprise that nobody appreciated even in 1938 (though Meitner knew the mass deficits from binding fell off with heavy atoms) was that heavy nuclei are unstable toward fission because of the short range of the strong force (which itself, as a force, was not appreciated). E=mc^2 and the falling mass deficit is not an explanation, but only a measurement of this oddity. When a large nucleus is deformed the strong force can be overwhelmed like a snowball on a mountainside pushed over an obstruction to create an avalanche.  All the power comes from the fact that all large nuclei are like avalanches waiting to happen, with the net energy stored inside them (from electromagnetic repulsion). That energy has been stored since the large atoms were made in neutron star collisions or supernovae (it&#39;s stored gravitational energy ultimately). The neutron is is a mere trigger to get past the binding strong force and let the longer-range electromagnetic force push the nuclear halves apart, and release energy from this push.", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T07:31:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Killaj Sandor", "comment_text": "The obsequious bucket holly succeed because quill spectroscopically film among a weak family. greedy, cluttered heron", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T20:11:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LyRAn ELohei Starseed", "comment_text": "And you people idolize him for being a \u201cgenius\u201d when scientists and inventors of his day said the opposite", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T13:03:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nic", "comment_text": "Nukes are for pu**ies", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T11:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaira Suneja", "comment_text": "hey, listen i saw your video.

As a nuclear engineering student currently studying nuclear physics, I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m fairly well-equipped to talk about this.<br><br>To begin: Nuclear power plants are incapable of exploding like a nuclear bomb. <br>Anyone who says they are is wrong, and is either repeating misinformation or deliberately lying. There&#39;s an incredibly simple explanation. In bombs, all the nuclear material is together in order to maximize the rate of fission. In nuclear power plants, the uranium is contained in small pellets roughly the size of a pencil eraser, which are wrapped in ceramic and put in fuel rods with tons of water and moderator between each fuel rod. This is why a nuclear accident is called a &quot;Meltdown,&quot; because the core of the plant literally melts into a pile of sludge. The explosion at Fukushima was actually caused by a design flaw that resulted in hydrogen buildup, which then ignited, and only was an issue in the first place because of a freaking *tsunami*.<br><br><br>The next point is the &quot;knife&#39;s edge&quot; comment. The short answer is, &quot;that&#39;s not how that works.&quot; The long answer is a bit more complicated. The simplest (but still functional) explanation goes as follows:<br>There is a curve that looks like a parabola (it&#39;s not but its close enough) that is nuclear efficiency vs temperature. Essentially, when you heat something up, it first becomes less efficient, and then becomes much more efficient. Modern nuclear reactors operate at a temperature that assures the if they were to overheat, the fuel would lose efficiency until it stopped heating up, at which point the reaction can be controlled and brought back to safer levels. The plant at Chernobyl operated on the other side of that bell curve, so it heated up exponentially and there really was nothing left to do but run.", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T00:11:30Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Yatukih001", "comment_text": "Because they are impossible.

If even one nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima it would have made life in Japan completely impossible. That means all multicellular life and not just a few Japanese citizens living in Hiroshima. There would be nobody around in Hiroshima today. Nuclear weapons are nothing but a scare scam designed to scare delusional people. When people are delusional they are afraid and that makes them easier to control. Its how Xi Jingping lost control over the Chinese Communist Party and made it into a national socialist paradise. Since nuclear weapons no longer sell the companies are allowing people to admit the hoax one by one. The mushroom clouds are nothing but the effects of fertilizers which have caught fire.

Each U235 atom split releases around 202.8 MeV, which is the energy equivalent in Joules of 203 electron charges. In comparison, that is roughly several dozen to a hundred times more energy released per event compared to detonating TNT.<br>Now imagine an exponential chain reaction of this much energy, and it&#39;s not hard to imagine the horrendous mushroom-shaped clouds we&#39;ve come to know. One step further is the hydrogen bomb, where the nuclear fission reaction is used to create the conditions for the second (and even third stage) of a fusion bomb, which is various factors more powerful than a fission bomb.<br><br>Weapons are &quot;easier&quot; to make than energy harnessing facilities, because nuclear reactors using fission to tap energy require a supercritical chain reaction (1 fission event triggers exactly 1 other fission event), whereas bombs can just let it go on uncrontrollably. The reason that the reaction can even be kept at a supercritical rate with Uranium is because it has an inherent delay in the chain reaction, making it possible to reverse/stop the reaction using the rods nuclear reactors are known to have, which absorb neutrons to halt or reduce the chain reaction when needed.<br><br>Fusion energy is theoretically possible by creating and magnetically controlling a plasma in a 30x30x30m toroid chamber, where the weight equivalent of a post stamp&#39;s worth of deuterium-tritium is brought to 150 million degrees kelvin to create self-sustaining fusion conditions.

The theory of relativity is the theory of nonsense. &quot;Time&quot; is three dimensional, not one dimensional. I.e., time is not a thing, it is the process of comparing.  To time is to compare one motion to a reference motion, such as a running person to a swinging pendulum. To travel in time is to travel in comparing. Time travel is as simple as spitting, just walk down any street and compare all the things you see to each other. By living and existing, you are &quot;time&quot; travelling. Sensing is timing, i.e, comparing motions to get usable information. Existence is motion, not a &quot;thing&quot;. <br><br><br>Fission is the decay/destruction/breakdown of matter/chemicals, similar to molecular breakdown/chemical reaction. Fusion is an entirely different beast, it is the creation of denser atoms/matter through constantly-applied/sustained extreme pressure. Chemical/fission reaction releases pressure, fusion requires pressure. Fusion is only capable in stars where adequate extreme pressures are sustained constantly. The instant that the pressure reduces below a critical value is the instant that the fusion ends is the instant that the fusion radiation ends.<br><br><br>Nuclear bombs are impossible because the very instant of the beginning of the &quot;explosion&quot; would be the very instant of the end of the &quot;explosion&quot; since the critical pressure being applied to start the fusion is instantly reduced by the outward &quot;explosion&quot;. The sun radiates because it is always under extreme pressure, the sun doesn&#39;t explode.  Fusion cannot be sustained on or in Earth, we have no way to sustain the pressure required, but fission easily can because it&#39;s the breakdown of unstable atoms, not the creation of stable, larger atoms.  <br><br><br>Fission is decay pressure, it can go critical if enough decaying mass is brought together, releasing a sudden flash of intense radiation. If the mass is kept below critical mass, then only much less intense radiation is released and can be used to heat water. If fission matter collects into too great of a mass, it goes critical and can overheat its surrounding water pool, turn it to steam and thereby blow the roof off of the nuclear power plant. The steam pressure blows the roof off, not the decaying radiating nuclear fuel which just radiates until it&#39;s fully decayed to stable atoms. <br><br><br>Fission is similar to a piece of paper warming up. As the paper gets to a critical temperature (pressure) of 454 F, the paper will flash to C02 and water, i.e., release radiation while breaking down into smaller molecules. <br><br><br>The best a fission &quot;bomb&quot; could do is release a flash of radiation. Radiation is not explosive, it just burns when too concentrated, e.g., standing too close to a fire. The flash is the chain reaction, but it only continues if the mass remains stuck together. A fission &quot;bomb&quot; can&#39;t exist because the &quot;exploding&quot; mass would immediately be blown apart, thereby dropping the critical pressure to zero. Radiation is emitted, not exploded, in a sudden flash or slowly.<br><br><br>To claim that such things as fission, fusion, or nuclear bombs exist is to claim that water will explode when it freezes or melts. At standard atmospheric pressure, the critical point for water is 32 F, it then &quot;flashes&quot; to ice, or if ice, it &quot;flashes&quot; to water. If you&#39;re not convinced, then you might want to sell your fridge and stay indoors all winter, just to remain safe.<br><br><br>Mod Civ is just being fear manipulated by the usual suspects as a means for them to endlessly divide, conquer, and thusly profit over humanity. The sheople are watching too much of the parasite&#39;s Tv and Hollywood movies instead of using their brains for thinking critically, no flashes of insight coming out of those bottoms. <br><br><br>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were carpet fire-bombed, the populace hiding out in bomb shelters of course, the destruction not noted as anything unusual by the Japanese government, same as the rest of the cities in Japan and Germany that were burned to the ground by intense Allied fire bombings, millions of humans torched and burned up. The only thing going off in &quot;nuclear testing&quot; is tonnes of TNT, which is why &quot;nuclear&quot; bombs are still measured in terms of kilotons and megatons of TNT. The closest anyone has gotten to 10,000 tonnes of TNT going off and lived to tell about it is about 3 miles. It&#39;s all theatre and fakery. It ain&#39;t the billionth time that the masses have been duped, keep counting.<br><br><br>Only the military has the &quot;secrets&quot; of how to make a nuclear &quot;bomb&quot;, and everyone should know that military intelligence and intelligence are opposites, the former is Lie and the latter is Truth. Military is all about covert behaviour and spreading fear and lies, that&#39;s the reason for its existence.

Chernobyl was not a nuclear explosion, neither was 3 mile island. The grade of plutonium or uranium used in a reactor is not high enough to sustain that reaction. It is high enough to cause a &quot;meltdown&quot;. This is simply where the reaction gets out of control (as you mentioned), but since the quality of the fuel is low all that happens is the temperature of the reaction spikes and literally melts the reactor. This is usually accompanied by a steam explosion (see the two previous examples) as a massive amount of water is converted to steam very quickly and the pressure builds up until the whole thing just explodes. It isn&#39;t a nuclear explosion, but it still sends radioactive material all over the place.<br><br><br>Why write this small essay?

First, there are mechanisms that slow the reaction, producing negative feedback. For example, if the reaction increases the material may expand, expanded material is less dense and this causes increase in critical mass and slowing down of the reaction (keeping steady state). Second, the drawing might give an impression that you split an atom and the neutrons immediately hit two more atoms. This is what is called prompt criticality and you want that in a bomb. In a nuclear reactor this is all built so that neutrons given off can&#39;t sustain the reaction by themselves. The reaction to be sustained must be reinforced with neutrons that have already left the radioactive material, got slowed down outside (for example in moderator) and only when it is slowed down some of it comes back and only then provides necessary extra neutrons to keep the reaction. This process means that any exponential increase in the reaction will be greatly slowed down to a speed that is much easier to control.<br>The issue with Chernobyl RMBK reactor was that it had negative void coefficient meaning if it got too hot, the steam voids in water would actually increase reaction rate rather than decreasing it.

In the test they had to ramp it down to test if the emergency-cooling system would work. But they changed the planned test because of some other reasons first letting the reactor run at half-power for prolonged times, then going to a near-shutdown like state where the reactor was too cool and &#39;poisoned&#39; with reaction elements. <br>They also shut down all safety mechanisms to prevent the reactor to shut down as it should have in that unsafe configuration - they wanted to safe time. A Poisoned reactor takes a long time (several hours) to ramp up again and in that time is unstable. To hasten the process the removed nearly all control-rods to ramp it up faster. <br>And now that is a problem: The reactor starts powering up, but the poisoning is still getting cured, so the power-increase gets faster and faster.<br>And then the test proceeded and shut down half of the cooling pumps. Now the water started boiling which again increases the power-output drastically. To slow that down they got frantic and inserted all control rods which had the slight problem that they initially increase reactivity and only decrease it when the are inserted further.<br><br><br>By now we have a reactor with no mechanism to decrease the power production, all safety turned off, the water boiling, high steam pressure, nearly no cooling and a runaway nuclear reaction.<br><br><br>The poweroutput of the reactor at that time surged to well over its rated maximum power - in fact it was well over 100 times what it was rated for.<br>Just for comparison - the US produces roughly 4000 TWh of electricity per year - that is an average of 450 GigaWatt.<br>For several seconds Chernobyl was producing over 300 GigaWatt - a single reactor producing nearly as much energy as the US is consuming nowadays.<br><br><br><br><br>What happened there was human error on several levels, ignoring the protocol, ignoring all safety warnings, disabling all safety systems and making the worst decisions at the worst times.<br>With decently modern reactors it would be entirely impossible to create such a scenario.<br>Heck, even Fukushima shows that. It was one of the largest earthquaks and Tsunamis, the waves went over the seawall specifically designed to stop tsunamis and the reactorbuilding was submerged in over 4m of water. Pretty much all backup safety systems were destroyed at that point. They startwed injecting freshwater to cool the reactor but the gauges were showing wrong numbers leading to the reactor not being cooled correctly. <br>After they finally managed to get backup power installed again and pump in water too cool the reactor an explosion destroyed all that again.<br><br><br><br><br>The 2 nuclear catastrophes we had so far are one where everything that could go wrong was made to go wrong, and one were one of the biggest natural disasters was needed and it still was a minor accident overall.", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T09:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "corieg1", "comment_text": "i have that book, it&#39;s really good.", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T07:18:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "X Gen", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why we should always be hesitant to regard something as impossible.

Due to the earthquake changing the distribution of Earth&#39;s mass, the Japanese earthquake should have caused Earth to rotate a bit faster, shortening the length of the day by about 1.8 microseconds (a microsecond is one millionth of a second).The Japan quake should have shifted the position of Earth&#39;s figure axis (the axis about which Earth&#39;s mass is balanced) by about 17 centimeters (6.5 inches), towards 133 degrees east longitude. Earth&#39;s figure axis should not be confused with its north-south axis; they are offset by about 10 meters (about 33 feet). This shift in Earth&#39;s figure axis will cause Earth to wobble a bit differently as it rotates, but it will not cause a shift of Earth&#39;s axis in space\u2014only external forces such as the gravitational attraction of the sun, moon and planets can do that.Earth&#39;s rotation changes all the time as a result of not only earthquakes, but also the much larger effects of changes in atmospheric winds and oceanic currents. &quot;Over the course of a year, the length of the day increases and decreases by about a millisecond, or about 550 times larger than the change caused by the Japanese earthquake. The position of Earth&#39;s figure axis also changes all the time, by about 1 meter (3.3 feet) over the course of a year, or about six times more than the change that should have been caused by the Japan quake.&quot;  While we can measure the effects of the atmosphere and ocean on Earth&#39;s rotation, the effects of earthquakes, at least up until now, have been too small to measure. The computed change in the length of day caused by earthquakes is much smaller than the accuracy with which scientists can currently measure changes in the length of the day. However, since the position of the figure axis can be measured to an accuracy of about 5 centimeters (2 inches), the estimated 17-centimeter shift in the figure axis from the Japan quake may actually be large enough to observe if scientists can adequately remove the larger effects of the atmosphere and ocean from the Earth rotation measurements. He and other scientists will be investigating this as more data become available.The changes in Earth&#39;s rotation and figure axis caused by earthquakes should not have any impacts on our daily lives. These changes in Earth&#39;s rotation are perfectly natural and happen all the time. &quot;People shouldn&#39;t worry about them.&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T23:26:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yukiteru Amano", "comment_text": "So 2 neutrons can touch each other", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T18:38:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jenish Pallath", "comment_text": "What is a half neutron ?", "comment_date": "2018-06-11T04:03:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Niraj", "comment_text": "I was wondering something for a while now, can u help me answer these.<br>Even though i don&#39;t know how the big bang took place but assuming it did took place and everything went flying outside and formed the universe as we see it, isn&#39;t it not supposed to expand, but instead come together due to the insane gravity of the universe????

Delay neutrons are exactly what they sound like. When something fissions they don&#39;t always give off their neutrons right away. Some can take seconds (which is basically inifnity time in the atomic world) or even up to several minutes. These make it so your reactor can be controlled by other larger forces as well as neutron forces. <br><br>For instance, your material has time to heat up and expand. This causes less material to be in the core region and slow your reaction down...before the delay neutrons hit and create a new neutron generation. There are other feedback mechanisms that operate on these broader timescales as well, but for power plants, that is basically the happs. Delay neutrons make things more easily manageable by removing a pure exponential function in the mix. A reactor would blow itself apart before it ever sustained a true nuclear explosion. Not even the aforementioned Chernobyl explosion was a nuclear one, it was likely a steam explosion cause by a 10000x increase in heat.

In 1934 No one in the world knew how to split the atom or if doing so would really make any power. The top German physicists at the time had a female jewish assistant who was also the guys collage physics classmate. They worked in Lab together a few years. When he got a job with Hitler&#39;s Germany in 1936, he brought his friend from school to work with him in Germany.  In 1938 this female brings the top German Nuclear scientists and her personal friend a paper with the math showing how the atom can be split reliably and what the resulting energy would be. She showed the negative amount each atom would produce in energy.  The moronic, ego filled, german brushed it off and told her she needed to go back to school; that amount of energy could never make a chain reaction. Three days later she gets a phone call from this same German man who tells her to leave the country now! The Nazi are coming for her. She is in Austria and then london within the next month. In 1939 she writes Einstein in america who had left germany only a few years earlier. She tells him of her findings and shows him the math in the letter. Einstein writes... &quot;as soon as I finished the letter I wrote to president Roosevelt her findings and the urgency of it all.&quot;  Within a day of getting the letter FDR summons Einstein to the White House. The next day after they meet? The manhattan project is started. <br><br>I am not sure why Veritasium  left this part of the story out? But I left the names of the people out on purpose so you can dig and find the truth. The math that uranium would provide enough energy and the need to oscillate the atom with neutrons to get it to split was found by a Jewish female who was kicked out of Nazi German for being a Jew.  She held the key to ultimate power. Funny how history works... Oh and six months after she left the Germans realized what she had done. They were ahead in the race to build the bomb until in 1943 when the allies blew up a heavy water plant in Norway that the Germans had seized. It set back their program almost a year. They never recovered.  <br><br>This is how Neutrons changed everything. But is not WHO Changed everything. I expected more. Just so we are Clear. This lady discovered how a Neutron could be used to oscillate the outer shell of an atom to split it in two and that the resulting 2 Neutrons of energy would be a negative amount for each atom but would chain react to a positive amount of energy if enough Uranium or Plutonium could be used and if it was at a highly refined state.  I am not sure where This channel got its information but it is not... All there. <br><br>Neutrons might have changed everything. But they needed a Jewish Female to get people to pay attention to them.

Its followers&#39; number is over 1.5 billion worldwide. Along with Judaism and Christianity, it is considered to be one of the three Abrahamic traditions.<br><br>4) There are five pillars of practice in Islam. These practices must be undertaken with the best of effort in order to be considered a true Muslim: A) Shahadah - declaration of faith in the oneness of God and that Muhammad is the last Prohet of God. B) Formal prayer five times a day. C) Fasting during the daylight hours in the month of Ramadan. D) Poor-due &quot;tax&quot; - 2.5% of one&#39;s savings given to the needy at the end of each year. E) Pilgrimage to MeKka at least once, if physically and financially able.<br><br>5) There are six articles of faith in Islam. These are the basic beliefs that one must have in order to be considered a true Muslim. They are belief in: A) the One God. B) all the Prophets of God. C) the original scriptures revealed to Prophets Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad. D) the Angels. E) the Day of Judgment and the Hereafter. F) the Divine decree (or destiny).<br><br>6) Islam is a complete way of life that governs all facets of life: moral, spiritual, social, political, economical, intellectual, etc.<br><br>7) Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the world. To become Muslim, a person of any race or culture must say a simple statement, the shahadah, which means bearing witness to the belief in the One God and that Prophet Muhammad is the last Prophet of God.<br><br>8.&quot;Allah&quot; is an Arabic word that means &quot;God&quot;. Muslims also believe that &quot;Allah&quot; is the proper noun of God.<br><br>9) Allah is not the God of Muslims only. He is the God of all people and all creations. Just because people refer to God using different terms does not mean that they are different gods. Spanish people refer to God as &quot;Dios&quot; and French people refer to God as &quot;Dieu&quot;, yet they are all the same God. Interestingly, most Arab Jews and Arab Christians refer to God as &quot;Allah&quot;. And the word Allah in Arabic appears on the walls of many Arab churches.<br><br>10) The Islamic concept of God is that He is Loving, Merciful, and Compassionate. But Islam also teaches that He is Just and swift in punishment. Nevertheless, Allah once said to Prophet Muhammad, &quot;My Mercy prevails over My Wrath.&quot; Islam teaches a balance between fear and hope, protecting one from both complacency and despair.<br><br>11) Muslims believe that God has revealed 99 of His Names (or Attributes) in the Holy Qur&#39;an. It is through these Names that one can come to know the Creator. A few of these Names are: the All-Merciful, the All-Knower, the Protector, the Provider, the Near, the First, the Last, the Hidden, and the Peace.<br><br>12) Muslims believe in and acknowledge all the Prophets of God, from Adam to Jesus. Muslims believe that they brought the Message of peace and submission (Islam) to different peoples at different times. Muslims also believe that these Prophets were &quot;Muslims&quot; because they submitted their wills to God.<br><br>13) Muslims neither worship Muhammad nor pray through him. Muslims solely worship the Unseen and Omniscient Creator, Allah.<br><br>14) Muslims accept the original unaltered Torah (the Gospel of Moses) and the original Gospel (the Gospel of Jesus) since they were revealed by God. However, none of those original scriptures are in existence today, in their entirety. Therefore, Muslims follow the subsequent, final, and preserved Revelation of God, the Holy Qur&#39;an.<br><br>15) The Holy Qur&#39;an was not authored by Muhammad. It is the speech of God, revealed to Muhammad, and written into physical form by his companions.<br><br>16) The Holy Qur&#39;an has neither flaws nor contradictions. The original Arabic scriptures have never been changed or tampered with.<br><br>17) Actual seventh century&#39;s copies of the Holy Qur&#39;an, complete and intact, are on display in museums in Turkey and many other places around the world.<br><br>18) If all copies of the Holy Qur&#39;an  in the world today were burned and destroyed,<br>the original Arabic would still remain. This is because over 11 million Muslims memorise it,  verbatim; they are called Hafiz (or &quot;preservers&quot;) they have memorized the Quranic text letter for letter from beginning to end, every word and syllable. Also, chapters (Surahs)  from the Qur&#39;an are precisely recited from memory by every Muslim in each of the five daily prayers.<br><br>19) Muslims do not believe in the concept of &quot;vicarious atonement&quot; but rather believe in the law of personal responsibility. Islam teaches that each person is responsible for his or her own actions. On the Day of Judgment, Muslims believe that every person will be resurrected and will have to answer before God for their words, thoughts, and deeds. Consequently, a practicing Muslim is always striving to be righteous.<br><br>20) Islam was not spread by the sword. It was spread by the word (Islamic teachings) and the example of its followers. Islam teaches that there is no compulsion in religion (the Holy Qur&#39;an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD3k1hgbUXQ&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a>6 and 10:99).<br><br>21) Terrorism, unjustified violence and the killing of innocent people are absolutely forbidden in Islam. Islam is a way of life that is meant to bring peace to a society, whether its people are Muslims or not. The extreme actions of those who claim to be Muslims may be, among other things, a result of their ignorance or uncontrolled anger. Tyrant rulers and those who commit acts of terrorism in the name of Islam are simply not following Islam. These people are individuals with their own views and political agendas. Fanatical Muslims are no more representatives of the true Islamic teachings than Timothy McVeigh or David Koresh are of Christianity. Extremism and fanaticism are problems that are common to all religious groups. Anyone who thinks that all Muslims are terrorists should remember that the famous boxer Muhammad Ali, perhaps the most celebrated person of our era, is a practicing Muslim.<br><br>22) The word &quot;jihad&quot; does not mean &quot;holy war&quot;. Instead, it means the inner struggle that one endures in trying to submit their will to the will of God. Some Muslims may say they are going for &quot;jihad&quot; when fighting in a war to defend themselves or their fellow Muslims, but they only say this because they are considering that it will be a tremendous struggle. But there are many other forms of jihad which are more relevant to the everyday life of a Muslim such as the struggles against laziness, arrogance, stinginess, or the struggle against tyrant transgressors or against the temptations of Satan, or against one&#39;s own ego, etc.<br><br>23) Women are not oppressed in Islam. Any Muslim man that oppresses a woman is not following Islam. Among the many teachings of Prophet Muhammad that protected the rights and dignity of women is his saying, &quot;...the best among you are those who treat their wives well.&quot; (Tirmidhi)<br><br>24) Islam grants women numerous rights in the home and in society. Among them are the right to earn money, to financial support, to an education, to an inheritance, to being treated kindly, to vote, to a dowry, to keep their maiden name, to worship in a mosque (masjid), ... etc.<br><br>25) Muslim women wear the head-covering (hijab) in fulfillment of God&#39;s decree to dress modestly. From a practical standpoint, it serves to identify one as attempting to follow God in daily life and, therefore, protects women from unwanted advances from men. This type of modest dress has been worn by righteous women throughout history such as Mary, the mother of Jesus.<br><br>26) Arranged marriages are allowed in Islam but are not required. Whereas &quot;forced&quot; marriages, usually stemming from cultural practice, are forbidden. Divorce is permissible, however, reconciliation is what is most encouraged. But if there are irreconcilable differences then Islam permits a fair and just divorce; only as a last resort if life between both husband and wife proves impossible.<br><br>27) Islam and the &quot;Nation of Islam&quot; are two different religions. Islam is a religion for all races and enjoins the worship of the One Unseen God who, Muslims believe , never took human form. The &quot;Nation&quot;, on the other<br><br>hand, is a movement<br>geared towards non-whites and teaches that God appeared in the form of Fard Muhammad in 1930 and that Elijah Muhammad (a man who died in 1975) was a prophet of God. These beliefs clearly contradict the basic Islamic theology outlined in the Qur&#39;an. The followers of &quot;the Nation&quot; adhere to some Islamic principles that are mixed with many other teachings that are alien to Islam. To better understand the difference between the two, read about Malcolm X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and his subsequent comments to the media. Islam teaches equality amongst all the races (Holy Qur&#39;an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD3k1hgbUXQ&amp;t=49m13s\">49:13</a>).<br><br>28) Not all Muslims are  Arabs. Islam is a universal religion, and a complete way of life , which includes followers from all races of people. There are Muslims in and from virtually every country in the world. Arabs only constitute about 20% of Muslims worldwide. Indonesia has the largest population of Muslims with over 220 million.<br><br>29) In the five daily prayers, Muslims face the Kaaba in MeKka, Arabia. It is a cube-shaped stone structure that was originally built by Prophet Adam and later rebuilt by Prophet Abraham. Muslims believe that the Kaaba was the first house of worship on Earth dedicated to the worship of the One and Only God. Muslims do not worship the Kaaba. It serves as a central focal point for Muslims around the world, unifying them in worship and symbolizing their common belief, spiritual focus and direction. Interestingly, the inside of the Kaaba is empty.<br><br>30) The hajj is a simultaneous pilgrimage to the Kaaba made by millions of Muslims each year. It is performed to commemorate the struggles of Abraham, Ishmael and Hagar in submitting their wills to God.", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T17:11:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrvanosNL", "comment_text": "No mention of Lisa Meitner? :(", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T17:11:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Musef", "comment_text": "Good video Vsauce", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T17:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bepowerification", "comment_text": "people should stop seeing particles as something solid and finally accept the fact all of it is just energy in waveform. just saying.", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T17:05:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RipzOnNubes", "comment_text": "It wasn\u2019t a rock...", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T17:03:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PalimPalim1337", "comment_text": "I heard Thorium is a much safer way of producing nuclear power, but was abandoned because it cannot be used in order to make an atomic bomb.
