Therefore, we are able to believe that our grandparents were right, longing for &quot;the good old days.&quot; <br>Grim indicators abound\u2013extreme heat waves and raging fires in Europe and the United States, America bleeding between one mass shooting and the next, inflation reaching historic highs to the point that recession seems likely, the unending Russian war in Ukraine continuing to cause shockwaves across the globe. <br>Britain and Italy face political instability. Sri Lanka sank in front of people&#39;s eyes while its leaders fled the country.  The quiet country of Japan saw the assassination of its former prime minister in the daylight.<br>As shocking as everything looks, nothing has changed that much in the world.   The main change has been in the accumulation of information and people&#39;s connections in the world. In past times we set out on walking tours to hear what was going on in the neighboring town and rocked inside a ship for two months to get to know a distant country. <br>In later periods, we bought a ticket for a high-speed train or took planes to land on a distant continent to know other realities and people. Now without getting up from the chair and with the press of a key we are there, in the heart of the world. In less than a second, the entire colorful, noisy and bustling reality unfolds before us, stunning us with its growing influence.<br>We hear and see, feel, admire and respond to everything that happens to everyone in every corner in real time. Communication between us requires us to absorb an intensive flow of information which we consume like addicts. <br>How often does someone read a book and go to a friend to share, &quot;Listen, what a good book I read!\u201d We are in a world that is all news that we are not built to absorb, engagements that we are unable to tolerate. As a consequence, people are getting sicker physically and mentally.<br>The endless bonds formed between us are cold, flat and alienated. They have no depth, warmth or identification. They lack sympathy and willingness to approach, and do not take into account that we are one. If the world seems full of crises, it is the ties between us that are broken.<br>The physical bonds between us have become tight and fast, and so it should be, but we need to adjust ourselves internally and emotionally to it. We need to insert warmth within these bonds that will strengthen and connect us instead of breaking us apart. You can turn off the news a bit, open a purposeful book, talk to each other, and feel each other.<br>Instead of running around with eyes on the monitor and absorbing fragmented pieces of information, we can get a real picture of reality when we look at creation as integral, knowing that it has direction and purpose. All of reality, past or present has a single purpose: to make us perceive that we are one, like nature, and to understand that only through our mutual guarantee and interdependence will we be able to overcome any hardship.

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

He&#39;s the only way to eternal life! He loves you so much He died for your sins. He was crucified in fact, buried and raised again on the 3rd day according to the scriptures. Why would want to turn down that free gift. He&#39;s calling you to repent and trust Him. Our way may seem right but it usually leads to destruction. Jesus Christ isn&#39;t just a righteous man or good teacher, He&#39;s Lord of lords and King of kings! He&#39;s coming back to judge this world full of sin and evil. Please rethink your plans, it&#39;s not to late to turn. I did it and was born-again! Leaving behind my old way and now I live through the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. God&#39;s Spirit is given to those who believe in His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ and who trust in Him alone.

We are just plain human and only the Creator of the world in which we live CAN and WILL save those who chose Him.

Leaving organized religions after realizing the error in taking a belief has allowed me to see with my heart and my knowing. I now know that all the religious books, writings, teachings, texts, scrolls, stories passed down, etc. were all constructed by others who have the ability to see the past and future events. They, in turn, responded by leaving a lot of conflicting and agreeing books lying around to control, confuse, distort, DIVIDE, and, conquer the human intellect, knowing, and heart, by the means of controlling the ego of the human with fear based teachings that cannot be verified in any manner. Those same teachings are multi-faceted with the intention to involve the human in participation of human sacrifice, the torture of other humans for &quot;a greater good and it&#39;s purpose&quot;, the normalization of going against our nature of love, the value of money over life, the normalization of laws requiring paper licensing to enter into a decision to be committed to another person and unite with them in heart, and, all forms of division, control, power-driven ill-based harm against fellow life, the creation of weather and events causing destruction, the creation of BUGS to devour and destroy the plant based life forces of humans and allow for ego to rule us instead of LOVE. When we study the stories of the buddah (one example) we find that he too was unable to verify anything and he too allowed the ego to overtake intellect by knowing he was consuming a poisonous substance that had been prepared for him and instead of deciding to live by refusing to eat the substance he chose to eat it and declared that was the only way to honor those who had prepared it. He also determined without any ability to verify that there was no creator/god and that we are all just a part of an energy that is one. Some of the ideas presented by those teachings are obviously incapable of being truth, such as no creator, when it is obvious that everything has been created. If the people before us were so technologically advanced and this was suppressed from our knowledge by all the conflicting and agreeing stories they created and left lying around then it would be very possible for the future humans (the you and the me) to miss the understanding that they (those advanced technological people from the past) have the ability to create ALL KINDS OF OTHER LIFE AND DESTRUCTIVE FORCES thereby deceiving us to believe that a &quot;good creator&quot; is responsible for those creations too. We (the human) are not like the bugs, the destructive weather, the illusions that are all around us, etc. etc. We are actually different because we are truly connected in LOVE but the connection has been twisted, contorted, marred by lies, tricks, games, money, power, control, fear, and all forms of the OPPOSITE OF LOVE, JOY, PEACE, PATIENCE, KINDNESS, GOODNESS, FAITHFULNESS, GENTLENESS, AND, SELF-CONTROL. That is correct they took all the characteristics that are absolutely the foundation for existing in a united human life of happiness and they made them a prize that could only be given if you participated in the opposite of those characteristics for the greater good of a creator. Then they combined them into books that contain all the opposites of those truths with fear, control, torture, and all forms of oppression for selfish gain, including oaths, rituals, laws, mind-control, etc. This goes back beyond our comprehensions because we are believing beliefs that are deceiving us from the state of being where we actually reside inside of LOVE. We are divided from our fellow man and worse than that we believe that it is a good thing. All that we can know is what is real. The way to know it is to feel it with our hearts and not by reading anything or viewing any pictures/carvings or trusting any visions that may appear before our eyes because those are not able to be verified of their sources and therefore leave us open to MASSIVE DECEPTION away from the LIGHT OF LOVE that actually is the power of us all. Some have chosen to use that power of love to distort everyone&#39;s perceptions and they did this by creating massive destruction in times before us and controlling the beliefs of the people with manipulation and fear. DO NOT BELIEVE IN CHANNELING. You cannot know it&#39;s source. Everything that we &quot;believe&quot; in our current age is impossible is actually not impossible. It has just been taught to us that it is not possible and we believed it. Stop taking a belief. Feel the real with your heart inside of LOVE. STOP BEING AFRAID OF THE CLAIMS OF DESTRUCTION, AND THE IMPENDING &quot;DOOM&quot; THAT WILL BE &quot;DIFFICULT&quot; FOR US. Start to see the manipulation of your psyche be those who would make those claims that they have some special knowledge given only to them. That is EGO TALKING. That does not align with LOVE. It aligns with fear and control for the selfish gain of others. Those who want to stop the UNITED HUMAN LIVES OF LOVE from being available to us have broken their own hearts with their choices to carry out these ILLUSIONS against us as a human race. WE NEED TO UNITE IN LOVE IMMEDIATELY AND STOP BELIEVING AND START FEELING. BE AWARE THAT NO ONE ELSE IS ABLE TO KNOW TRUTH THAT IS ONLY GIVEN TO SOME BUT NOT TO ALL AS A WHOLE. WE ALREADY HAVE THE TRUTH AND WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT NOT TO BELIEVE IT BECAUSE IT IS INSIDE OF US! WE ARE LOVE AND WE MUST UNITE AS SUCH NOT FOR MANMADE MONETARY SYSTEMS AND POSITIONS OF POWER, BUT, INSTEAD FOR THE SAKE OF LOVING THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE. WE ARE LOVE. WE CAN COME BACK TO AN EXISTENCE OF UNITED, PURE, LOVE AND BE IN JOY, PEACE, PATIENCE, KINDNESS, GOODNESS, FAITHFULNESS, GENTLENESS, AND, SELF-CONTROL. We can do this. We really can. Yes, we are human and we grow at different speeds but that does not give us authority to exert control over another simply because in our current view we took a belief that one was right and knew more than another. Just think of how many times in your own experience that you &quot;believed&quot; you had something understood only later to learn that there was still more to understand! We never stop understanding possibilities and that is how we have advanced to the point that we are but it has been dictated to us in an unhealthy manner causing all divisions. We don&#39;t have to choose to go back to primitive civilization unless we want to. I personally enjoy the advanced technology when it is used for LOVE OF ALL HUMANKIND AND NOT FOR CONTROL BY ONLY THOSE WHO CURRENTLY VIEW THAT THEY UNDERSTAND MORE THAN ANOTHER. We are CONSTANTLY GROWING AND CHANGING, BUT, LOVE ALLOWS THIS. Don&#39;t participate in the opposites of LOVE, JOY, PEACE, PATIENCE, KINDNESS, GOODNESS, FAITHFULNESS, GENTLENESS, AND, SELF-CONTROL. Don&#39;t give into something you know will harm yourself or another simply because you don&#39;t want to cause another to expand their own understanding. Ego is not truth. Love is truth. As one human with love in the forefront of his psyche has shared with other humans recently said &quot;DON&#39;T PLAY IN THE FEAR, DON&#39;T PLAY IN THE FEAR&quot;. STAY IN THE LOVE AND LOVE ALL OF ONE ANOTHER.", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T15:45:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H\u00e2z\u0113l", "comment_text": "Cool.", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T15:30:39Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "naim2101", "comment_text": "Amazing vid, so interesting and i just love the way that pro snake-man handles the most venomous snakes in the world like it&#39;s nothing, barely shaking hands and laughing and explaining at the same time.

And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.\u201d<br><br>Why did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us?<br>Christ (God\u2019s Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam\u2019s flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh (Jesus Christ\u2019s flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death\u00a0 shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell.<br>Christ, who is God\u2019s Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions. Christ died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,\u00a0 Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power (God). Through Christ\u2019s sacrifice we gain Salvation through God\u2019s abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus.<br>John chapter 3 verse 16: &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 8: &quot;But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d<br><br>Christ came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam.<br>Death in Adam, Life In Christ:<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 19: &quot;For as by one man\u2019s disobedience (Adam), many were made sinners, so also by one Man\u2019s (Jesus) obedience, many will be made righteous.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 18:  &quot;Therefore, as through one man\u2019s (Adam\u2019s) offense judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man\u2019s (Christ\u2019s) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 17:  &quot;For if by the one man\u2019s offense (Adam\u2019s offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One (Jesus Christ).&quot;<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 12:  &quot;Therefore, just as through one man (Adam) sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 21: <br>\u201cSo that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d<br><br>Through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it more abundantly. Yes, Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation. The Salvation of His shed blood, and resurrection. Adam\u2019s flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation.<br>1 Corinthians 15 : 21-22, \u201cFor since by man(Adam) came death, by Man(Christ), also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all shall be made alive.\u201d<br>Christ\u2019s sacrifice, the crucifixion\u00a0of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, resurrection, eternal life and salvation.<br><br>Christ is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, warring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all.<br>Amen! Halleluyah!<br>Revelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: \u201d And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. \u201c<br>Now do you see friends, why Christ Jesus is so Important for our Salvation? Yes.<br>Now, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus? Yes.<br>Christ is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men (us humans).<br>God loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God\u2019s Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us. Christ is God\u2019s living Word.<br>Will you accept Christ and be saved? Your eternity depends on it. What happens after death, is what&#39;s  important. Where will you spend eternity?<br>Romans chapter 6 verse 23: \u201d\u00a0 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d<br>John Chapter 3 verse 16: \u201d For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<br>Salvation is free!<br>Christ already paid the price, all you have to do is receive salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach.<br><br>So who is Christ?<br>He is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is The Rock not cut out by human hands. He is the Root of David. He is Salvation. He is the way, the truth, and life. He is the promise fulfilled to Abraham.<br>Amen!   I love you Lord!<br><br>God created the heavens and the earth with His spoken Word. Did you know that Jesus is that Word, through which all things were created? Yes.<br>John chapter 14 verse 6: &quot;Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d<br>Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16:<br>&quot;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.\u201d<br>John chapter 1 verse 1 to 4:<br>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\u00a0God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.\u201d<br><br>I hope that you now know and understand Christ better, without any doubts, to the glory of God.\u00a0Amen!<br>Christ is for all who will receive Him.<br>This is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said we should pray. Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13:<br>\u201cOur Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.\u201d<br>Now that you understand who Christ is, share Christ with others. Christ is The Good News. What do we do with good news? We share it. Amen!<br><br>Repent of your sins. Sin no more! Be baptized in Jesus Name.<br>Submit to God.<br>Love God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Keep God\u2019s Commandments.<br>Love one another.<br>Forgive one another.<br>It is written, \u201cresist the devil, submit to God, and the devil will flee from you.\u201d<br>Hate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.<br><br>Rejoice Our King Is Scheduled To Return<br><br>Revelation 19 verse 13-16, &quot; He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called\u00a0The Word of God, and the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.

People are shown the real part, which makes them ready to believe the imaginary part.  That is how the idea of biological evolution has spread since 1859.  Variation (microevolution) is the real part.  The types of bird beaks, the colors of moths, leg sizes, etc. are variation.  Each type and length of beak a finch can have is already in the gene pool and adaptive mechanisms of finches.  Creationists have always agreed that there is variation within species.  What evolutionists do not want you to know is that there are strict limits to variation that are never crossed, something every breeder of animals or plants is aware of.  Whenever variation is pushed to extremes by selective breeding (to get the most milk from cows, sugar from beets, bristles on fruit flies, or any other characteristic), the line becomes sterile and dies out.  And as one characteristic increases, others diminish.  But evolutionists want you to believe that changes continue, merging gradually into new kinds of creatures.  This is where the imaginary part of the theory of evolution comes in.  It says that new information is added to the gene pool by mutation and natural selection to create frogs from fish, reptiles from frogs, and mammals from reptiles, to name a few.\r<br>\r<br>Just to be clear, evolution theory puts no limit on what mutation/natural selection can invent, saying that everything in nature was invented by it - everything:<br> I merely scratched the surface debunking the evolution Lie, look it up for yourself and stop deceiving the people!!", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T22:21:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "1moreTimeMom", "comment_text": "Has this guy not been milked in a while.Yeah been a while \u2026\u2026 wonder what happened?", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T21:47:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Joppe Schutte", "comment_text": "Autocorrect...", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T21:46:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anwj1", "comment_text": "They killed a snake for testing :((", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T21:03:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Madakor - Tech, Education, Career", "comment_text": "Hey man, were you stung by one of these serpents off camera?", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T20:32:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Firstname Lastname", "comment_text": "It really seems like there should be a safer way of doing that.", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T20:25:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ressuu", "comment_text": "Stupid question, but why doesn&#39;t the snake handler just use protective gloves eg: knifeproof gloves?

I was picking butter beans on my family farm and within two minutes my leg was turning dark purple. Most people say that they didn&#39;t even know they&#39;d been bitten. Not me. I felt it. I felt it immediately and jumped up and saw it still on my leg. My mother took the spider and picked me up and threw me into the car. Granted if at home we lived within 1 minute to the hospital but on the farm we were more like 15 minutes from the hospital. When we got there and it was was within 8 minutes I was unresponsive. I lived in a smaller city at that time so they didn&#39;t have any antivenom on hand to treat me and it had to be helicoptered in for me. It took me a long time to get over that bite and I come very close to death. They saved my leg and I had gause stuck inside my leg with a small circular ring that hung on the outside so after a two weeks they could pull it out. I ended up getting this done twice. They also think this one bite at a young age caused my immune system to be more allergic to other bug bites like ants, bees, mosquitos, etc. After my case the hospital started carrying more treatments on hand for those that are all ready allergic because their reactions are already more lethal and quickly. My mom&#39;s quick thinking to take the spider also helped save my life and make their jobs so much easier than giving many treatments not knowing what type of spider that bit me and knowing from how fast I was turning to get me to the hospital immediately.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T14:19:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hamppzah", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ziWrneMYss&amp;t=2m24s\">2:24</a> love the excitement!!", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T14:14:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dima Litovka", "comment_text": "<b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ziWrneMYss&amp;t=8m01s\">8:01</a></b><b> The Great Southern Trendkill.</b>", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:57:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff B", "comment_text": "I was cringing through the entire video", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:48:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francisco Rodriguez", "comment_text": "There&#39;s more poison in the Snakes \ud83d\udc0d in governments and financial institutions.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:43:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Baxendale", "comment_text": "&quot;It&#39;s just who is quicker&quot; as he throws the snake in and tries to close the door as quickly as possible.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:41:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "very wise", "comment_text": "That venom cup looks like my shot glass.<br><br><br><br>Hmmm", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:32:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackie Hall", "comment_text": "No snake is good snake, only the dead one.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:14:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hes no khes", "comment_text": "Those images from the beginning are too bad for that snake. \u0130ts Racism for these animals!", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:02:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "friendly gangsta", "comment_text": "What if the thin glass breaks after he slam the door close \ud83d\ude35", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T13:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SpockFpv", "comment_text": "Cool, can you show proof of this evolving tooth theory?

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

As a former employee of a blood bank, I am really beginning to wonder exactly what was done with the plasma we shipped overseas.   (All blood donations, which by law, MUST be donations if they are to be transfusable, are spun down to separate RBCs from plasma.   Plasma from male donors is either stored to use for transfusion, or flash-frozen to later harvest cryo-precipitate.  However, plasma from female donors may not be used for transfusion, due to TRALI, or Transfusion Induced Acute Lung Injury.   If a female transfusion patient receives plasma from another female donor,  an unintentional immune response is triggered, and just like the cytokine storm that Covid-19 causes, the lungs can be shut down, or severely damaged.   So we sent all female plasma overseas to be used to make coating for certain medicines, and also blood pathogen tests.   I now wonder how much of the process I have taken for granted.      oh, and  incidentally, cryo-precipitate, a dense collection of healing proteins most commonly used to promote recovery in surgical procedures, would be used to treat bites from a different venomous snake - one whose venom is flesh-eating)", "comment_date": "2022-03-24T04:21:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Club 6", "comment_text": "What if they extracted some memory immune cells?

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019.", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T17:59:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Robin Vask", "comment_text": "What horses????", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T17:56:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FreeRadical09", "comment_text": "Zac should have his own superhero movie because damn, that mate is the real deal.

However, the snake-catcher was unsure whether this was actually effective and therefore continued to treat his snakes with care. Nicholson, along with other Britons, began to consider that venom might provide its own cure. Although Scottish surgeon Patrick Russell had noted in the late 18th century that snakes were not affected by their own venom,[22] it was not until the late 19th century that Joseph Frayer, Lawrence Waddell, and others began to consider venom-based remedies again. However, they and other naturalists working in India did not have the funding to fully develop their theories. Not until 1895 did Sir Thomas Fraser, Professor of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, pick up Fayrer and Waddell&#39;s research to produce a serum to act against cobra venom. His &#39;Antivenin&#39; was effective, but failed to make an impact as the public were focused on contemporary Pasteurian discoveries.[23]<br><br>Another anti-ophidic serum was developed by Albert Calmette, a French scientist of the Pasteur Institute working at its Indochine branch in 1895, to treat the bites of the Indian Cobra (Naja naja).[24]<br><br>In 1901, Vital Brazil, working at the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, developed the first monovalent and polyvalent antivenoms for Central and South American Crotalus and Bothrops genera,[25] as well as for certain species of venomous spiders, scorpions, and frogs.<br><br>In Australia, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) began antivenom research in the 1920s. CSL has developed antivenoms for the redback spider, funnel-web spiders and all deadly Australian snakes.[26] &quot;", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T23:50:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Conbeer", "comment_text": "This is an extremely generous giveaway.

The Hook-nosed Sea Snake\u00a0(Enhydrina schistosa) is in fact more venomous.  But good luck getting most sea snakes to bite.  There are several sea snakes that are more venomous, but they&#39;re usually not counted due to the fact that they rarely ever bite.  Another thing is the fact that every snake is different and one individuals venom could be wildly more or less toxic than the next. So in herpetology, we generally don&#39;t look at whether one snake is the most venomous or not due to all of these variables. &quot;Dead is dead&quot; in the words of Jim Harrison, who owns the Kentucky reptile zoo and is a great friend of mine.  I highly recommend watching the documentary &quot;The Venom Interviews&quot; to get a real look into the life of a herpetologist and venom extractor.  Jim is one of the very few in the US who actually extracts venom from snakes for antivenom and medical research.  I highly suggest doing a follow-up video with him.

Stupid things, biting everybody. And then people expect me to tell them what to do about it. I\u2019ll tell them what to do. Don\u2019t get bitten in the first place. That\u2019s the answer. I\u2019ve had enough of it. Hydroponics, now, that\u2019s interesting. Talk to you all you like about hydroponics. Fascinating stuff, growing plants artificially in water, very interesting technique. We\u2019ll need to know all about it if we\u2019re go to Mars and places. Where did you say you were going?\u2019<br><br>\u2018Komodo\u2019<br><br>\u2018Well, don\u2019t get bitten, that\u2019s all I can say. And don\u2019t come running to me if you do because you won\u2019t get here in time and anyway I\u2019ll probably be out. Hate this office, look at it. Full of poisonous animals all over the place. Look at this tank, it\u2019s full of fire ants. Poisonous. Bored silly with them. Anyway, I got some little cakes in in case you were hungry. Would you like some little cakes? I can\u2019t remember where I put them. There\u2019s some tea but it\u2019s not very good. Sit down for heaven\u2019s sake.<br><br>\u2018So, you\u2019re going to Komodo. Well, I don\u2019t know why you want to do that, but I suppose you have your reasons. There are fifteen different types of snakes on Komodo, and half of them are poisonous. The only potentially deadly ones are the Russell\u2019s viper, the bamboo viper, and the Indian cobra.<br><br>\u2018The Indian cobra is the fifteenth deadliest snake in the world, and all the other fourteen are here in Australia. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard for me to find time to get on with my hydroponics, with all these snakes all over the place.<br><br>\u2026<br><br>We\u2026 asked him how many of the snakes he had been bitten by himself.<br><br>\u2018None of \u2019em\u2019 he said. \u2018Another area of expertise I\u2019ve developed is that of getting other people to handle the dangerous animals. Won\u2019t do it myself. Don\u2019t want to get bitten do I? You know what it says in my entry in Who\u2019s Who? \u201cHobbies: gardening \u2013 with gloves; fishing \u2013 with boots; traveling \u2013 with care.\u201d That\u2019s the answer. Oh, and wear baggy trousers. When a snake strikes it starts to inject venom as soon as it hits something. If you\u2019ve got baggy trousers most of the venom will just get squirted down the inside of your trousers which is better than down the inside of your leg. You\u2019re not eating your cakes. Come on, get them down you, there\u2019s plenty more in the fridge.\u2019<br><br>\u2026<br><br>\u2018So what do we do if we get bitten by something deadly, then?\u2019 I asked.<br>He blinked at me as if I were stupid.<br><br>\u2018Well what do you think you do?\u2019 he said. \u2018You die of course. That\u2019s what deadly means.\u2019<br><br>\u2018But what about cutting open the wound and sucking out the poison?\u2019 I asked.<br><br>\u2018Rather you than me,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want a mouthful of poison. all the blood vessels beneath the tongue are very close to the surface so the poison goes straight into the bloodstream. That\u2019s assuming you could get much of the poison out, which you probably couldn\u2019t. And in a place like Komodo it means you\u2019d quickly have a seriously infected wound to contend with as well as a leg full of poison. Septicaemia, gangrene, you name it. It\u2019ll kill you.\u2019<br><br>\u2018What about a tourniquet?\u2019<br><br>\u2018Fine if you don\u2019t mind having your leg off afterwards. You\u2019d have to because it would be dead. And if you find anyone in that part of Indonesia who you\u2019d trust to take your leg off then you\u2019re a braver man than me. No, I\u2019ll tell you: the only thing you can do is apply a pressure bandage direct to the wound and wrap the whole leg up tightly, but not too tightly. Slow the blood flow but don\u2019t cut it off or you\u2019ll lose the leg. keep the leg, or whatever bit of you it is you\u2019ve been bitten in, lower than your heart and your head. Keep very, very still, breathe slowly and get to a doctor immediately. If you\u2019re on Komodo that means a couple of days, by which time you\u2019ll be well dead.<br><br>\u201cThe only answer, and I mean this quite seriously, is don\u2019t get bitten. There\u2019s no reason why you should. Any of the snakes there will get out of your way well before you even see them. You don\u2019t really need to worry about the snakes if you\u2019re careful. No, the things you really need to worry about are the marine creatures.\u2019<br><br>\u2018What?\u2019<br><br>\u2018Scorpion fish, stone fish, sea snakes. Much more poisonous than anything on land. Get stung by a stone fish and the pain alone can kill you. People drown themselves to stop the pain.\u2019<br><br>\u2018Where are all these things?\u2019<br><br>\u2018Oh, just in the sea. Tons of them. I wouldn\u2019t go near it if I were you. Full of poisonous animals. Hate them.\u2019<br><br>\u2018Is there anything you do like?\u2019<br><br>\u2018Hydroponics.\u2019<br><br>No, I mean is there any venomous creature you\u2019re particularly fond of?\u2019<br><br>He looked out of the window for a moment.<br>\u2018There was,\u2019 he said, \u2018but she left me\u2019.", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T13:29:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Feryla\u10d3\u2022 \u2665Mathis", "comment_text": "When you make a mistake, you fix it.", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T13:29:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "North West Alternative Media", "comment_text": "digin that perspective at the end, we all can help save lives in our own way", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T13:28:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ngiorgos", "comment_text": "Zac, while shaking and sweating: &quot;The moment I stop doing that after a milking is the day I quit&quot;<br>That quote really hit me hard!
