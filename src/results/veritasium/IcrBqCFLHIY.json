I tried looking it up, but I&#39;m not really sure where to look or what exactly to search. Have we reached our limit yet? I think obviously we haven&#39;t right? Since CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s keep improving, but maybe a government or military has made a chip that reached the technical limit, since public and commercial tech is always years behind private or secret government tech. Or have we come up with some new tech or concepts to surpass the limit?<br><br>This subject seems like a huge deal, with how dependent everything is on tech now, even down to the cell phones we all use every day. Would CPU/GPU tech just completely stagnate once we reach the limit? Some may think &quot;well just increase the size of the chip&quot;, but that actually doesn&#39;t work, increasing the size and amount of transistors doesn&#39;t increase the speed. An analogy would be to think of a large city that is too crowded. If it takes a person an hour to commute to work due to traffic then someone waved a magic wand and doubled the size of the city, there wouldn&#39;t be as much traffic, but the length of the commute increased just as much as the traffic decreased, so in the end the commute still takes an hour. In the same way, just increasing the size of a chip doesn&#39;t increase the speed, it&#39;s not the size that matters but the density of transistors, the maximum amount packed into a specified area.<br><br>Would love another video on this subject.", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T12:44:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashley Broening", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY&amp;t=5m35s\">5:35</a> &quot;This will only start to become a problem 10 years from now.&quot;<br>Me: <b>checking the date of this video</b><br>&quot;8y ago&quot;<br>Me: oh boy", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T17:47:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krishna Ghatol", "comment_text": "10 years down the track in not quite far now is it?", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T02:41:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ravi Sundaram", "comment_text": "So nine of the ten years have passed by.

The PN junction should be explained as a voltage barrier, 0.3V for germanium transistor or 0.7 V for silicon that must be overcome before current flow will pass. Then the gain of transistor takes place, like 5 milliamperes at the base will produce a 100 milliamperes at the collector.

They have also replaced bipolar transistors in RF applications like hand-held two_way radio, smartphones and the likes.<br>But the field effect transistor is not what Brattain, Shockley and Bardeen invented; it is more what Shockley meant to invent, but they achieved something different, they made a bipolar transistor.<br>And the bipolar transistors were the mainstream types at Moon landing; the ground radar and the radio links used a bipolar transistor type invented for the occasion, with one collector, one base, and a large number of emitters to reduce stray inductance and allow few watts output at UHF frequencies (2N3866). The FET existed at time (2N3819) but they hadn&#39;t achieved the necessary specs  yet. Bipolar transistors are more complex to explain -because of the base electron-hole recombinations and the minority carriers injection which control the output current; the latest seems to defy comprehension.<br>May be a video explaining how an integrated circuit with four billions of (MOSFET) transistors is obtained? How no human can manage such complexity, how the designers do design functional logic blocks, and a software tool costing a bit less than one million dollars, it actually manage to &quot;compile&quot; those blocks... not into code, but into silicon.<br>Again, I appreciate your video very much,<br>Regards from the UK...", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T17:01:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas", "comment_text": "Transistors <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY&amp;ab_channel=Veritasium\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY&amp;ab_channel=Veritasium\r</a><br>\r<br>Doping \u2013 when an element is injected into the silicon to improve  \r<br>\r<br>N \u2013 Type is when phosphorus is injected into silicon. Phosphorus has an extra electron which mean that it conducts current better.\r<br>\r<br>P \u2013 type is when boron is injected into the silicon. Boron is missing an electron which creates a hole. These holes still conduct electricity as they move around.\r<br>\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>N \u2013 type and P \u2013 type are neutrally charged. In N \u2013 type, it\u2019s negative electrons that can move while in P \u2013 type it\u2019s the positive hole that move.\r<br>\r<br>A transistor is made with both N \u2013 type and P \u2013 type. Transistors are mainly made up of P \u2013 type conductors with some N \u2013 type conductors on the top right and left. \r<br>\r<br> \r<br>\tThe left N \u2013 type conductor is called the Source, and the right is called the Drain. Both the N \u2013 type conductors have an electrical source. The P \u2013 type conductor also has an electrical source all the Gate that is separated from the P \u2013 type conductor by a layer of Oxide. \r<br>\t\r<br>\tDepletion Layer is the area around where the N \u2013 type and P \u2013 type touch. In this area the extra electrons from the N \u2013 type move over to the P \u2013 type and fill the missing electrons. The depletion layer acts a barrier preventing electrons in the N \u2013 type area into the P \u2013 type. \r<br>\r<br>\tThe state that I\u2019ve just described is when the transistor is off. To turn on the transistor, a small voltage is brought to the gate. This electricity attracts the electrons so much that the electrons overcome the depletion layer. From here the electrons move through the P \u2013 type conductor, through the other N \u2013 type conductor, and then through the drain.\r<br>\t\r<br>\tThis essentially creates a switch. With the transistor is off, power from the source is trapped in the left N \u2013 type conductor. But when the P \u2013 type conductor receives power, it creates a path for the electrons to the drain.", "comment_date": "2020-11-07T04:09:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sumit Mahato", "comment_text": "Great expression", "comment_date": "2020-11-07T03:23:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pankaj Kumar", "comment_text": "In 2020 Transistors are only 5nm, eg.

I want to add an electron to one end and I&#39;m want all the electrons to push each other so that about\u00a0an electron falls off the other end (if it didn&#39;t the charge and therefore the voltage would build up). Now if the average spacing of electrons is not 10 nm but 1 nm the implication is that I will be able to push more electrons on (and off) this latter substance per unit time than on (and off) the former substance. Why?A resistor is though of differently - no one mentions a low density of free electrons, rather they mention electrons loosing energy via collisions with impurities, vibrations, and lattice discontinuities.

Field-effect transistors do have an insulated gate, and there are both enhancement type and depletion type FET&#39;s - we usually specify MOSFET&#39;s (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors).<br><br>Finally, bear in mind that transistors operate in both an analog and a digital mode.  They are not just a switch, but rather, a potentiometer (variable resistor).<br><br>I do think your overall demonstration is great - you just need to get your facts straight.

I enjoy and \u2019LIKE\u2019 every one of them.  You have covered some aspects of science that I have never covered.<br>I was especially enjoyed the videos on How Transistors Work.  This video brought back some memories that I have been dwelling on all day.  At one time, long ago, I made transistors while working at Monsanto\u2019s Research Center located in Creve Coeur Missouri, just west of St. Louis.  The year was 1969.  At that time, Monsanto was a major provider of polished single crystal silicon wafers used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Our job was to push the edge of the envelope in production and device technology.  The state of the art wafer was 2\u201d in diameter.  (When I retired from the industry the wafers were up to dinner plate size.)  I worked mostly with 1.5 inch wafers.  You caught my attention when you said that The laptop computer that I\u2019m using now contains over a billion transistors.  We \u2018squeezed\u2019 seven transistors on one 1.5\u201d wafer.  They were visible without a microscope!  Some IC production was going on with our customers but no where to the density you reported.  We selectively diffused phosphorus (POCl3) or Boron (I don\u2019t remember the compound) into areas of the wafer to produce the N-P-N junctions. Evaporated or sputtered metal contacts and tested the results.<br>This entire technology was new to me.  My training was in vacuum tube technology.  In fact, there were no college courses teaching semiconductor technology that I was familiar with at that time.<br>Thank you for the trip back in time and all of your video seres.<br>Paul, Ocala, FL", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T09:18:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andres Escobar", "comment_text": "wazzzzaaa", "comment_date": "2015-11-05T20:54:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olivia Belcher", "comment_text": "Really helpful vid!!!

The message that comes across (to me) is that a transistor is nothing but a remote-controlled switch, a device that permits or prohibits the flow between two points depending on the input on a third point. Without the function explained properly, I&#39;m left with at least two questions:\u00a0<br>(1) so a transistor is essentially a modern version of a relay, right?<br>(2) in many applications, transistors have taken the place of tubes.

These use the designation of Source, Drain and Gate. Most other transistors are used to proportionally control current. The control signal is applied to the base or the gate as described in your example. As the voltage at the Base is increased the current flowing between the Collector (Source) and Emitter (Drain) increases. In order to amplify voltages this increased current must be passed through a load resistor to see the corresponding changes in voltage.<br><br>I know engineers and Scientists like to discuss hole flow but holes do not flow, electrons flow. Current is defined as electrons moving past a fixed point. A hole is the absence of something when the electron moves it fills a hole (nothing) and leaves a hole (nothing). Electronic techs (real world) only talk about electron flow.

That was great but I am still confused (and perhaps my confusion comes from not being able to see the rest of the circuit i.e. where ground is) but, in the NPN you discussed, wouldn&#39;t the electrons in both &quot;N&quot; type semi conductors (the left and right side in this video) be &quot;attracted&quot; to the p-type (center)?<br><br>In the video, at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY&amp;t=4m35s\">4:35</a> ish the electrons go from one n-type SC to the other (left to right in the video, the direction of which is irrelevant) using the positive voltage at the gate as a &quot;bridge&quot;?<br><br>My question is this. I understand valance electrons. I understand &quot;holes&quot;. But wouldn&#39;t both N-type SC attract electrons to the P=Type? In other words, with this video, instead of going left to right, shouldn&#39;t it pull left to middle and right to middle? AKA the p-type will pull/attract electrons towards it from both N-type SC?<br><br>I think the answer to the question I am asking is that, electrons from the &quot;right&quot; n-type SC are attached to the lower potential (ground) and thus move/attract there. Electrons from the &quot;left&quot; n-type SC move towards the lower potential and &quot;fill&quot; the holes in the P-Type while doing so. Once the holes in the P-type are filled, they pass over the neutral &quot;center&quot; and proceed through the &quot;right&quot; n-type SC toward low potential.

That is true of some mosfets, igbts, and scrs, however there are other types of mosfets and bjts that operate linearly. That is they are only partly off-depending upon a particular bias point and input signal. As the small input signal varies the transistor provides more or less conduction and usually more or less power. This action also results in a power gain, or signal gain. This action is also similar to a variable resistor. Instead of rapidly varying your big switch on and off, you could represent these transistors by slowly varying a potentiometer high and then low. \u00a0This is actually the idea behind the name &quot;transistor&quot; which is short for &quot;transfer resistor&quot;.
