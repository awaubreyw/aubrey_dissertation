If you pause the video while the ball is flashing but held steady, the image will still show it as the mixture of colors. If the frame rate was high enough without persistence, then each time you paused you would only see what color LED was lit up at the time. There is some variance in the color, but i think most people likely noticed that even while the video was running, it wasn&#39;t a solid purple but rather flashed between light and dark purple rapidly.
