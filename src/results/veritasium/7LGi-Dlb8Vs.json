The reason I say that is because in both cases you have some amount of mass with some inertia. In the raw egg, the yoke keeps moving because it has inertia and also because it is not bound to the egg from the inside, it&#39;s more fluid, whereas in the hard egg there still is inertia, but since you spent energy trying to stop the egg at its center, that energy was transferred to the portions bound to the skin from the inside too. <br><br>Conclusion: Inertia alone doesn&#39;t seem to explain the simple observation of one egg stopping and one egg rotating still, since they both have inertia.", "comment_date": "2016-05-29T02:35:43Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Chris P", "comment_text": "While it is inertia, what can be more appreciated is the actual definition of how the yolk is able to stay spinning due to its fluidity compared to that of the cooked egg which is in a sort of rigid state.", "comment_date": "2016-05-10T16:52:43Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Morris", "comment_text": "I will argue that like newtons other laws he is probably specifically wrong and inertia will be a factor of the bending effect placed on spacetime/particle fields", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T12:34:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "clover", "comment_text": "Like a torque converter.

There is a supporting membrane that holds the yolk in place inside the egg. As egg starts to go bad, this membrane breaks down. So when you stop the egg spinning, even though the yolk continues to spin inside, there&#39;s no efficient way for it to pass this energy back to the shell, and the egg won&#39;t start spinning again.
