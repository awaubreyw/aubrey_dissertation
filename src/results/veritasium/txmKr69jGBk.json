In the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, in the late 50s and early 60s when I was a kid, they used to have a similar device that worked the same way. It was demonstrated in the Electric Theater. That one was relatively portable (with casters) and smaller: IIRC, the size of a large hassock. <br><br>The demonstrator would wheel it on stage and show the levitation of the aluminum plate. He (always &quot;he&quot; in those days) didn&#39;t have the light fixture, though. He never mentioned any of the electrical specs, but the machine gave off a distinct hum. He did show that if you pressed down on the plate, the humming would get louder. That showed the plate didn&#39;t get that hot in the short demo time, so spraying water on it wouldn&#39;t be dramatic (but he did mention the plate got warm). Also, the machine didn&#39;t have anything to prevent water from dripping into it. <br><br>The Electric Theater was so cool! It was my favorite place. First time I saw strobe lights, UV light, and a microwave transmitter as big as a refrigerator. The last had two small plates on bars on the front (transmitting antennas, I guess), and he had an ear of popping corn on a stick that he placed between them, and the corn would pop on the ear! You could smell the fresh popcorn! Totally magic at the time! Imagine how I felt when compact microwave ovens started showing up around 1970!<br><br>He also had a setup that would catch the shadow of an exploding balloon with a synchronized strobe flash on a phosphorescent screen! Now anyone can see high-speed videos of that, but at the time it was completely WOW!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T04:11:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David Fryer", "comment_text": "I have not found one video this guy has done which was less than fascinating!", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T02:20:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solo Jammer", "comment_text": "That&#39;s how ancient Egypts carried and cut the stones to build Pyramids.

ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual (IN BALANCE). So, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Therefore, invisible AND visible SPACE in FUNDAMENTAL equilibrium AND balance IS the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of space consistent WITH/AS what is fundamentally balanced GRAVITATIONAL/ELECTROMAGNETIC force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or balanced with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as this balances AND unifies ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy AND gravity; as this balances gravity AND inertia. (This explains F=ma AND E=mc2, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.) ACCORDINGLY, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! A PHOTON may be placed at the center of the Sun (as a point, of course), as the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent WITH/AS what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. E=mc2 IS F=ma. So, time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves that electromagnetism/energy is gravity. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience.<br><br>BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Touch AND feeling BLEND, as GRAVITY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY are linked AND balanced; as gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND balanced IN AND OUT of SPACE AND TIME, as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This is entirely proven by the mathematical unification of Maxwell&#39;s equations AND Einstein&#39;s equations (given the addition of a fourth spatial dimension). Indeed, this explains why Einstein&#39;s equations predict that SPACE is either expanding or contracting. Moreover, this is why Einstein&#39;s equations allow for (or predict) &quot;black holes&quot;. Balance and completeness go hand in hand. Einstein&#39;s equations are NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL. Notice the term c4. GREAT !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. I have provided top down, true, and overwhelming mathematical proof AS WELL that gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, It is now abundantly and quite clear that Einstein never nearly understood gravity AND physics/physical experience. (Obviously, E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma.) Sir Isaac Newton now ranks second.<br><br>Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.<br><br>In fact, the ROTATION of the moon does MATCH it&#39;s REVOLUTION. ACCORDINGLY, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. SO, a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times; AND this is THEN consistent WITH F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, GRAVITATIONAL force/energy is proportional to (or balanced with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. So, &quot;mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent WITH what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. It ALL makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS F=ma. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. (&quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=mc2 IS F=ma.) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

Do the math. Assuming you had a superconducting coil and it took no energy when nothing was being pushed, in how small of a volume would there be enough space available to produce a magnetic field strong enough all around the superconducting system so that if a bullet were fired from any direction (except for a special bullet that had an oscillating field too =P) it would be deflected off due to its own oscillating magnetic field? This requires both enough power density to produce the energy quickly enough to slow the bullet down as it approaches the system do that it stops moving before it hits it (use calculus) and energy density, since a particular amount of energy will be required during this process.<br><br>I could probably calculate it, but it would take more time than is worth it for me =P. Anyone knowing electromagnetic and Newtonian physics, calculus, and a bit of wit should be able to come up with an answer.<br><br>And then as a bonus question, how large of a bullet would be necessary to penetrate the field? Such a bullet would have to induce oscillating potentials in it opposite to the ones induced by the field at the same frequency. And after you realize that any object that wants to approach this system is going to have to be the same size using the same technology, how can you make a conducting system that can approach it aside from sticking in insulators? In fact, can you change the structure of the bullet, say with a spiral winding, so that the current instead produces a clockwise or counterclockwise force that makes the bullet spiral faster at the cost of only some reduced speed? Could you create a system that converts this energy into an electrical current that could be used to store the energy in a lithium ion battery without generating the repelling force?<br><br>Maybe one day weaponry will face these challenges =P.<br><br>Somebody do this because you can.", "comment_date": "2013-12-14T12:53:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "captain obvious", "comment_text": "i really love scientific videos, you learn something new everyday and it makes you realize that even the smartest people around don&#39;t know everything :D", "comment_date": "2013-12-14T03:08:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Freizza", "comment_text": "Screw the cooking point of view if you can have the plate vibrate less than the human ear can hear, and add some way to cool it, getting rid of gas powered cars is easy.
