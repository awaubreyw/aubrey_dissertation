Water also has attraction that creates water tension, bonding together, allowing small creatures to walk on water, and allowing smaller animals to weave baskets of underwater grasses to capture and hold small bubbles of air underwater to create underwater air nests for offspring, like dragonflies. (Helgramites) The real magic occurs when a water molecule is created. 1- oxygen atom bonds with 2- hydrogen atoms to create 1 molecule of water.  The magic occurs when they have a polarity charge, because the hydrogen atoms are at angles instead of diametrically opposed to each other.

I worked in geothermal reservoirs where we encounter similar capillary pressure measured values in the geothermal reservoir rocks because of the tiny pore throats like you mentioned in your video. I however, need to point out a confusing part in your video. At time stamp <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BickMFHAZR0&amp;t=2m21s\">2:21</a> you mentioned that the xylem tubes are 20-200 micrometers in diameter. And yet later on you said that the \u201cpores\u201d transporting the water, which I assume you meant the xylem tubes are only 2-2.5 nanometers in diameter. That\u2019s a difference of about 10,000 times. So which one is it? I believe it is the later and at these distances your video is correct, the electrostatic forces of the molecules of water are able to hold the meniscus at much higher pressures. But then this is the definition of capillary pressure. In geothermal rocks there is the additional effect of salts contained in the water at the pores and this results in even higher capillary pressures measured for a given size of the pore throat because of the additional electrostatic charge lent by the salt ions in solution.", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T11:52:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ovidiu Hretcanu", "comment_text": "if you count also that less than 2% of the solar energy is used for photosynthesis, you realize that trees, with all these sophistications, are abysmal at efficiency.", "comment_date": "2021-08-09T17:23:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PRAWIN SANTHANARAJ", "comment_text": "Still some stupids believe there is no God.", "comment_date": "2021-08-09T11:12:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PolicyjneAkcje", "comment_text": "I wake up in the morning, I go to work, I earn money, then I spend money to buy a beer, I drink all the beer, go to the toilet and all the beer is flushed down the toilet... the next day the cycle repeats ... \r<br>this is a real mystery", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T23:14:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramen Guy", "comment_text": "&quot;Right, Hank.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T23:12:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Let's Talk Science With Shashwat", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BickMFHAZR0&amp;t=1m19s\">1:19</a> , this professor is the physical embodiment of science", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T15:12:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anomie Normie", "comment_text": "Haven\u2019t finished watching yet, but my first thought was; \u201cBut they grow\u201d.

I realize that they are not conscious of being conscious like we are but are they aware of their surroundings, or are they only aware of where the light, CO2, and water are coming from? Is where their branches and roots shooting for a decision, or are they just growing in every random direction and what doesn\u2019t find resource just dies off? This, I guess, would be a lot like the thoughts we have but don\u2019t need or use. I know a tree can go into shock so do they feel fear, and joy? If the expressed emotions we radiate can effect their development then are they connected to us through very subtle wavelengths? If so, then there is a whole new technology standing in front of us to investigate. I realize that the oxygen they make is an extension of their branches that reaches deep inside of us and gives us life directly but like lightning that chooses a path through the air could there be a tiny electric current connection between plants and animals? There is obviously a relationship. But I think they are actually touching us inside and out at all times. Sound, light, and moving toward or away from them must exist some subtle awareness we and/or they could develop, eh? Oh well, just a thought. Clearly, we are not awakened yet and maybe not evolved enough to even ask or resolve the question. I know that if you understand the question you understand the answer.

It plugs into the sky and into the earth and makes one of earth and heaven. Like we, it is the child of earth and heaven and is our brother. We breath out what it breathes in. The seed is ripped in half by the hand of time like we are. We become two and must find our other half to define us and make us whole. Perhaps the tree was ripped from man like was the woman and we should turn our attention more toward the brother tree. Not my poetry but still good stuff.

Think about a bar of steel being stretched under tension, which is a LOT of tension by the time you may notice the stretching. In &#39;freedom units&#39; that force is expressed in pounds [force] per square inch (PSI), where 1 atmosphere is about 15 PSI.

Its rather confusing. In one moment I get it (the tension in a solid example) but as I think on it more, I question more about it and think there are interesting problems to be discussed. (The question of a really tall siphon comes to mind... I did see a soundless video of one built, but no discussion)<br><br>One such confusion: how can anything (whether its liquid, gas or solid) present less pressure than a vacuum, which has nothing in it. If the water is stretched far enough it would turn to gas (given the seed air) and yet a vacuum would have less pressure than this gas... So i&#39;m sure the logic is off, but it would seem that inherently the vacuum would therefore trump all in terms of absence of pressure.... Or perhaps I need to go back to the tension-in-a-solid thinking and consider that it is the water cohesion applying the forces (so is that really a &#39;pressure&#39;? or should we be talking about hydrogen bonds /attraction rather than &#39;negative pressure&#39;?)", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T21:00:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Bass", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/vvtPJKWUb2g\">https://youtu.be/vvtPJKWUb2g</a>", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T12:51:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Knowledge is Everything", "comment_text": "Why is this that when I have a question in my mind YouTube finds me that though I didn&#39;t searched for it. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T17:40:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niklas", "comment_text": "The sound was not good in this video, but the content was great!", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T23:04:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yora", "comment_text": "Trees don&#39;t evaporate most of their water into the atmosphere for fun.

And this extra water vapor that trees gradually put into the atmosphere helps make for more stable cloud formation, rainfall, and climate around them.

Side A is pushing against the wall, while the vakuum is simply not. This vakuum is NOT draging the wall, its simply not pushing. So vakuum is zero pressure by definition.

On smaller scales cohesion is more impactfull than on bigger scales (compare the shape of big and small waterdrops), so on those very small scales like the diameter of a xylem, the cohesion can actually be responsible for very big negative pressures.", "comment_date": "2015-07-12T14:03:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heather Spoonheim", "comment_text": "There is unrest in the forest<br>There is trouble with the trees<br>For the Maples want more sunlight<br>And the Oaks ignore their pleas", "comment_date": "2015-07-12T11:23:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sophrapsune", "comment_text": "You know... in Plato&#39;s dialogue Theaetetus, Socrates is made to say that wonder is the beginning of philosophy.

Saying that the water goes all the way up just so that it can evaporate while CO2 comes in, it sounds like you just said nature developed an amazing system for a small purpose. How I see this is that the water being evaporated is simply a way to excrete the water. The whole system is probably not designed only to bring water to the top, since you have said yourself that most water is wasted. I believe and it seems to make a lot more sense is that the negative pressure is used as a transport system for the water that will carry the nutrients from the roots to the tree. So the objective here isn&#39;t to get water to the top, but to get minerals to the tree.

In high school, we made a mercury barometer using a glass tube that was open on one end and closed on the other. With the closed end down, we filled with the tube with mercury.

Like the tree, we didn&#39;t try to suck the mercury up the tube, the tube was completely full of mercury when we started. What was in the glass tube above the mercury in the homemade barometer? We were told a near complete vacuum. Almost 0 atmospheres. Why wouldn&#39;t there have been -15 atmospheres in the glass tube, with the mercury remaining at the top of the tube (like the water in the tree xylem), instead of sinking down to about 30&quot;?

This process of water loss connects back to the tracheids (water conducting cells found within Xylem) and causes water to be taken from the Xylem, this water then travels along the tracheids into the air within the leaf following the water potential gradient. Xylem travels up the stem of the tree by the action of a water potential gradient, water moves from an area of high potential, to an area of low potential, gradually moving water up from the roots. Waters natural cohesive and adhesive properties and the small diameter of Xylem aid in its movement up the stem.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2013-12-17T20:34:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Ceballos", "comment_text": "Dude you are the man...", "comment_date": "2013-12-16T04:08:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charlie Oka", "comment_text": "Something must be wrong...<br>&quot;perfect vacuum&quot; doesn&#39;t exist.
