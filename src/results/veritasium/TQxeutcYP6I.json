Without gravity, the matter would just keep moving in a straight line thanks to inertia until it would randomly impact another piece of matter or get destroyed somehow.

Due to small irregularities in density and due to gravity planets formed.

(The answer is that the net angular momentum of a huge mass of randomly-moving particles around the center of mass is unlikely to be exactly zero, i.e. a mass of randomly-moving particles has a nonzero (albeit diffused) net angular momentum about its center of mass. Tidal forces and cataclysmic meteor impacts notwithstanding, the net angular momentum of the system will be conserved independently of its spatial distribution of mass. Consequently, as the particles coalesce under the force of gravity and assume the same motion, the conserved net angular momentum of a large, slowly-moving dust cloud transforms into a dense, relatively fast-spinning planet).", "comment_date": "2014-01-26T04:12:47Z", "likes_count": 420}, {"comment_by": "Arthur Clini de Souza", "comment_text": "the guy that said centrifugal force was awesome! cause i think this force doesnt exist!", "comment_date": "2014-01-26T01:54:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Biggest Metroid Fan in All Existence", "comment_text": "how much energy is used in the spinning of the earth and could humans harvest any of it and if so how?", "comment_date": "2014-01-24T22:47:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mithras Tauroctonos", "comment_text": "OK so: saying that the Earth spins because it formed from something that was already spinning is no different than my mom explaining her crazy requests &quot;Because she says so&quot;.
