Space devoid of all matter is still full of aether aka quantum fluid or quantum energy which means there never will be such thing as empty space. Also center of mass doesn&#39;t equal to center of gravity. Gravity doesn&#39;t have a center, it is non-point source omnidirectional static acceleration of aether towards the surface of a charged body like planet.

It&#39;s like saying bullet&#39;s don&#39;t drop until the last 10 feet... Where as what&#39;s obviously happening, is that the tension, regardless of how weak or strong it is, is keeping the entire slinky suspended, save for one link, the top most link, which unlike the other links doesn&#39;t have tension which is attracted upwards, and because density(something inherent to the slinky, like it&#39;s inherent tension, as opposed to the outside force of the earth&#39;s supposed &#39;gravity) dictates that more dense mass displaces less dense mass, the top most link displaces the air between it and the link below it, and then touches (fuses) with the link below it, and since there&#39;s no upward distance left for the lower link&#39;s tension to try and overcome, it then no longer is in a stasis and goes downwards as well, and then so on and so on. Remember the slinky is a SINGLE object so it can do this, but it&#39;s not like a string which is already practically fused. Actually you can probably in theory observe a similar effect dropping a string, but it would probably be practically non existent as the string if not already fused is practically already fused. So the same thing probably happens with a string, but since there&#39;s significantly less less dense mass occupying cavities the process is really really fast, which at the same time means that it&#39;s a really really small visual observation for one to make. And finally it&#39;s obvious that gravity is having no part in this, or else we&#39;d see this process occurring at the same time as the separate process of gravity.

Is it speeding up faster than the speed of gravity as it&#39;s going down? To test this I suggest to also have another person to drop a rock from the same height as the top of the slinky. If the tension does speed up the acceleration then using the slow speed camera take a measurement of the space and time between the rock and the top of the slinky at the time when the slinky is back to its original form. Then compare that distance and time with the distance and time of the bottom of the slinky to the ground. Without the test I can see at least 3 different outcomes, either the top of the slinky and the rock hits the ground at the same time or the top of the slinky hits first if so then take notice of the bottom of the slinky to see if it hits the ground at the same time as the rock does.

When the top part is dropped the tension is released and the slinky is trying to contract to its usual state. And while gravity still affecting the slinky it makes the top part accelerate with a greater speed then &quot;freefall&quot; on that mass should. Due to the tension in the slinky. The same tension that keeps the bottom not to start accelerating before the up tension is low enough to let gravity affect its acceleration. Same goes for the tennisball that makes the slinky extend longer and increases the tension to keep it in a lockes position. I can think of a few experiments that would show this.
