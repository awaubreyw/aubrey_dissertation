Also, it would be interesting to investigate, if energy of the transmitted electromagnetic wave is dependent of angle of incidence, as a consequence of the density and velocity of the electromagnetic wave in the particular &quot;fluid&quot;, which, by analogy with reflection seismic methods, such as AVA/AVO (Amplitude versus Angle&amp;Offset of incidence), that is widely used in seismic characterization of the  physical properties of the rocks with different saturation of the hydrocarbons, would give a hint what type of &quot;unknown&quot; fluid we are dealing with.<br><br>3. Application in medicine/radiology: Will &#39;&#39;scanning&#39;&#39; with wider frequency range of source (i.e. linearly modulated frequency sweep) would reveal specific character of the tissue in question, that could be quantified, improving diagnostic procedure. <br><br>4. Does different &quot;fluids&quot; perform polarization and, if so, could this effect could be utilized as a tool for characterization of the emanated material in the known environment  (in this case air or, maybe, in the vacuum, for more precise quantification), by detecting the same image with 2 sensor with 90 degrees polarized filters, where image (function in time)  for each particular pixel, that records this process as afunction in time, could be treated as Analytical signal [GEOPHYSICS. VOL. 44. NO. 6 (JUNE 1979);  Complex seismic trace analysis - M. T. Taner*, F. Koehler*, and R. E. Sheriff*], where instantaneous attributes of the recorded transmitted electromagnetic energy, could be derived, such as phase, frequency, energy, polarity, and many others.<br><br>5. Could such &quot;devices&quot;, with appropriate real time processing, be utilized for permanent scanning of the atmosphere, in order to define amount and types of air pollutant around the Earth globe, of any kind - i.e., distinguishing burned airplane fuel from chem trails, etc., since we have cosmic radiation of the wide frequency range as a source.<br><br>Once again, thank you for the brilliant demonstration!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Aleks", "comment_date": "2017-06-18T08:57:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angel Wilson", "comment_text": "An arc of electricity or a taser.", "comment_date": "2017-06-18T08:51:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "W.

What I was hoping you could check is whether the refractive index of salt water looks different than that of fresh water or not. An extension of that is to see what a water column would look like. Specifically what I would love to see/show my students is what it looks like to have cold salt water, then warm salt water, then cold fresh water, then warm fresh water. If there is any way to set that up, I would be eternally grateful, and earth science teachers, this video in itself is AMAZING for showing how a warm medium interacts with a cold one!

Attempted this one myself but the only parabolic mirror I have is in my telescope and is too degraded to really get a decent picture out of it. As for my bass cannon it was a 1000w subwoofer bolted to the water tank out of an old washer after cutting a hole in the center to accommodate the subwoofer. Not the best setup since it requires a very loud and powerful setup to drive enough force through the speaker to make standing waves but it works well enough with a tube guitar amp if you have one or know someone that has one.", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T18:06:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomer Vaknin", "comment_text": "how about music? how would sound waves look like?", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T18:06:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob M", "comment_text": "&quot;micro changes in air density&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T18:06:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ceej", "comment_text": "A fart would be funny", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T18:06:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shreyas Kishore", "comment_text": "How about seeing what a fart looks like in this?", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T18:05:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aag1234567", "comment_text": "compare it with a thermal camera...<br>- hot fluid meets cooler fluid.<br>-an egg sucked into a glass with a candle (or a burning tissue) in it.<br><br>that&#39;s all I can come up with on the spot, keep making these videos! keep staying awesome!", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T18:05:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0394\u0398\u03a3 \u039e", "comment_text": "wow, that was really amazing", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T18:05:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Archimagus", "comment_text": "That&#39;s cool AF.

Hence, I have doubts on whether my school is correct in teaching that the experiment supports the particle nature of light since there is a more likely cause of the recorded observarions- the radiometric effect.
