So that the balance can happen in one moment. Once the movement to intermediarily become balanced, the shifting begins again.

The moon has our oceans rotating on the surface inside our atmosphere. The tides rise and fall with the moons orbit.  Even though the oceans are rotating in the same axis as the planet they are rotating with our moon. I cannot remember if it is faster or slower than our rotation. Plus we are also 15\u00b0 off vertical with the sun that gives us seasons. Once you count in those few variables in the total equation would it be possible for us to flip? Ocean floor volcanic activity studies have been done that through tests they noticed magnetic polarity swap somewhere in the neighborhood of every 10,000 years give or take expanding from the fault lines. Continental drift is thought to be the result. I believe that was something they taught in middle or high school if memory serves me. When I first watched the footage I wondered if that had a hand in the magnetic polarity swapping. Swapping basically as it came from inside the earth in a continuous incredibly slow concrete pour (metaphorically speaking). Would the moon and our oceans be able to cause a planetary flip despite the stable rotation? I&#39;m sure the math is all there. It may be a few billion pages of notation for the equation and someone with the stuff to crack it I don&#39;t know.

My 3-hour auto shop class in my senior year was used to fulfill, somehow, a needed math credit. So as interesting as this YouTube is, what I find really startling is at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VPfZ_XzisU&amp;t=5m26s\">5:26</a>.

This is inside a space vehicle, right? It\u2019s a weightless environment, right? Disregarding the cute little flip, the rotational movement along a helical plane of the thing should push it straight out of the hole. The center-axis (did I use that term correctly?) of the doodad should stay in line with the center-axis of the hole from which it unscrewed itself. But as I watch the YouTube it is moving toward the upper border of the image. This could be an optical illusion. The motion could be relative. Maybe the hole is moving down, so the upward movement of the doodad is illusory. But if momentum is conserved (I\u2019m told that is why when I jump straight up the earth, moving at 1000 mph, doesn\u2019t spin underneath me) and if (but for the thrusters keeping it in orbit) that space ship and everything in it is all falling toward earth uniformly why does that doodad appear to move differently relative to the hole from which it was unscrewed?", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T20:22:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bela Lugrisi", "comment_text": "Explained beautifully, debunked pathetically.", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T20:20:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lonestar", "comment_text": "Might have missed it, but there wasn\u2019t any mention about objects being perfectly symmetrical and balanced.

In free fall on a space station,  what we observe,  while in the space station,  is limited by its size, so, the full effect cannot be seen. Neither can it be seen inside one of those close to free fall plane rides.<br><br>What this wing nut is, obviously,  proving,  is simple. When you undo a normal screw, wing nut, bottle top, it&#39;s anti clockwise. Clockwise to do it back up again. When the wing nut was unscrewed and alliwed to free fall continue its flight, it came off spinning anti clockwise. As it proceeded across the room, in its own imperfect way, it was doing what a gyroscope does on Earth. Consider a spinning gyroscope.  You can put it on a table then pull the top down to a little above flat and let it go. With the spinning wheel oart spinning over the edge of the table, hitting nothing,  the gyroscope remains as is until interfered with or rotation drops off enough. The only thing anchoring it to the table is the small bit upon which it was standing, down the centre of its pole. While spinning off at an angle, push the top of it down far enough and it drops off to the floor and keeps spinning but if you started the gyroscope spinning clockwise (right handed people normally do) and then caused it to fall by pushing the top down too far off the table, when it hits the floor,  from your perspective looking down at it, it&#39;s now spinning anti clockwise. It, also, kanded with a heavier thud than if you had the same gyroscope, not spinning and dropped it on its point from the same height.<br><br>If the gyroscope is a perfect one, then because of the spin, you can see the rest of its weight doesn&#39;t matter, in the tests above until the top and bottom points are almist or actually the same height. The original point,  on the table, gas lost enough spin point energy, diwn its shaft, to make it drop.<br><br>So, with that in mind, remember a wing nut is an imperfect simulacrum of a gyroscope but in free fall has advantages. Whwn it unscrews and flies off, it is building a minor spin point like a gyroscope does. Unfortunately,  the only gyroscopes I have observed,  have been on Earth. In space, the leading point of the spin shaft creates a spin point that would be happy not to flip over but unfortunately, the space station is orbiting Earth which is, itself,  spinning.  You may think, in free fall, on a space station,  that there&#39;s no gravity. OK so what&#39;s holding the space ship in orbit so it doesn&#39;t shoot off into space? The effects of the soace station orbiting and Earth spinning,  is enough to create something best visualised by looking from galactic north, outside our gakaxy, back down at it. See the arms? Earth spins mini versions of that, too. The wing nut with its spin point bubble hits a fronf like point of gravity emanating from Earth,  is not powerful enough to bash through it and because this point of gravity is bent like the arms of a galaxy, the spin point gravity bobs down minutely enough to flip the wing nut over and then cause drag so that the wing nut doesn&#39;t revolve but apoears ro just flip and continue. Now the wing nut, originally spinning anti clockwise,  is now spinning clockwise and cancels out the mini gravitic effect inside the tube and vegins making another at the leading edge if the spin. It hits another gravitic frond, flips the same and on it goes.<br><br>What I would like to see is the same wing nut released facing upwards or downwards (relatuve to Earth). It will hit a gravitic frond eventually but not likely to flip and repeat at the same rate as horizontally. <br><br>Simple, isn&#39;t it? BTW, that gyroscope on Earth.

The reason, as the object spins around the shaft with the T crossbar handle rotating, if the shaft goes minutely off centre, centrifugal force will throw it outwards and away from the centre of rotation until it is perpendicular to the direction of spin, at this time inertia will cause the already moving shaft to continue away from it&#39;s original direction and flip to the other end where it will settle momentarily due to running out of inertia.

First, no explanation can be truly intuitive if it relies on fictitious forces (that&#39;s a bit like using gods to explain natural phenomenon). Second, it doesn&#39;t actually explain anything. Let&#39;s adopt the rotating reference frame used in the explanation so centrifugal forces are exerted on the small masses in the z-direction. You then automatically say that these centrifugal forces accelerate the masses away from the y-axis, but why do they do? Why are these centrifugal forces not balanced by the centripetal component of the tension forces the same way the centrifugal forces on the large masses are? You seem to be begging the question: assuming the masses will accelerate to explain why they accelerate.<br><br>I can simplify this explanation significantly (in an inertial reference frame, no less): if the small masses are displaced slightly, the tension forces within the disk are not strong enough to prevent them from moving farther out away from the axis of rotation. As the masses move farther away from the axis of rotation, the tension forces increase. Thus, the tension forces within the disk act as a restoring force, producing oscillatory motion*.<br><br>While this cleans up the explanation you provided and removes the need to rely on fictitious forces, it does not address the key issue of explaining WHY the tension forces aren&#39;t strong enough to prevent the masses from moving outwards. My best guess for why that is ultimately comes down to the fact that nothing is really preventing the disk from rotating along that axis so the tension forces don&#39;t need to be that strong. If you think about the large masses, if the tension forces holding them in place were not large enough to produce the required centripetal acceleration then the only way for the large masses to move outwards is for the entire disk to break apart. Therefore the tension forces exerted on the large masses are as strong as they need to be to keep them rotating at a constant distance from the axis up to the point of mechanical failure of the disk. For the smaller masses, this is not the case. They can be moved farther away from the axis of rotation without destroying the disk simply by rotating the disk. And so that&#39;s what happens.

The opposite happens on other side. (left side tips down, right side up). The see saw type effect causes a shift in weight on the 3rd axis, makes it swing or flip to the opposite side. Once it reaches the mirror rotation, the angular momentum like on a top realigns it almost perfectly, but again the force was not even and a slight wobble is noticed, leading to a cyclical rotation.", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T21:48:18Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Judith Miller", "comment_text": "Actually, it\u2019s pronounced \u201cjohnny-beck-off.\u201d I know.

This looks to me like a liberated, or unrestrained version of the twisting forces on the blades of a variable pitch aircraft propeller in flight. In a single engine aircraft, the control mechanism drives the blades towards coarse pitch and the centripetal forces created by the engine driven spin drives the blades towards fine pitch. This is because the weight in the leading and trailing edges are a bir farther away from the axis of rotation in this condition. The rotation towards fine pitch is of course limited by the fine pitch stop, but if the fine pitch stop didn\u2019t exist, the blade pitch should oscillate between equal and opposite positive and negative blade angles if I disregard friction and aerodynamic effects. Blade angle is controlled by engine oil pressure, so if the oil pressure fails, the centrifugal blade twisting moment will twist the blades to fine,allowing the aircraft airspeed to spin up the engine rpm, helping the pilot to \u2018bump start\u2019 the engine. In a multi engine or a single engine aerobatic aircraft, there is a counterweight at right angles to the plane of the propeller blade so if there is a loss of oil pressure, the blades go to the feather position and the engine can stop, not being driven by the airspeed through the propeller.<br>So, is a variable pitch propeller a restrained version of this multi-axis spinning effect?

I watched many of them if not all. It is a great relieve that Dzhanibekov effect will not flip the earth.  <br>I am an engineer with experties on vehicle (aircrafts, ships and cars) dynamics and stabilities. I have a new way to understand Dzhanibekov effect. I am planning to make a video on this issue. If possible for education purpose, I would like to ask your permission to use the part of your video from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VPfZ_XzisU&amp;t=1m06s\">1:06</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VPfZ_XzisU&amp;t=1m36s\">1:36</a> which is a perfect description for this phenomenon. The root cause for Dzhanibekov effect is the nonlinear inertial torques (the angular velocity vector cross product the angular momentum). Recently, I made a scietific discovery that the same nonlinear inertial torques (moment) have caused many aircraft crashes, ship capsizes, and car rollovers. I published my findings in the book,  Nonlinear Instability and Inertial Coupling effects (2018). However, these inertial torques have been neglected in all these engieering fields so far. To save lives, I think that education for this phenoemnon is important. Recently, I posted two videos: The Physics of Golden Ray capsize, parts 1 and 2 on YouTube for your reference.

That sounds like a simplied mathematicians explanation and didn&#39;t provide any evidence the earth can&#39;t flip. The earth is not an asteroid. It is a very dynamic elastic system with a molten core that has surges of molten movement, and plate tectonics that cause large bodies far from the center to migrate. Then there are shorter term effects such as the earth redepositing large amounts of moisture such as glaciers aroind the planet.  For example the polar ice sheet is currently  3km thick sure not much compared to the 12000km diameter of the earth but the point is the earth look relatively static in our human viewframe but it is far from static. Look at even the 3 gorges dam filling creating a momentary imbalance.  So I don&#39;t think a simple mathematical equation is even close the proving the earth can&#39;t flip.  Maybe we should try modeling more dramatic scenarios that prove that the earth actually could flip such as adding larger amounts of polar ice or extreme mountain buildup with plate tectonics causing 100,000m high mountains. So many variables to test. It may help explain a lot of things that happen on earth such as the geological time periods Cretaceous, Jurassic,  Triassic, Permian etc which almost occur with approximate regulariy. I shall make it my ambition to prove you wrong that the earth can&#39;t mathematically flip.

As you said, the earth can&#39;t just flip like this. But this phenomenon could be the reason why the Sun changes it&#39;s polarity sometimes, and the Sun doesn&#39;t change the polarity as often as the axis of rotation of the bolt because of the diff\u00e9rence in the mass of the two bodies (billions and billions of Times and much more, and bigger mass implies bigger momentum)... The change in the magnetic polarity orientation of the Sun, which is much more massive than the planets in the system could lead to a change in the magnetic polarity of the planets too, as the mass of the Sun dominantes that of the planets, and this should be observed more closely, because if the mangetic polarity of our planet changes too much often, this could leave us without our magnetic field protection, and if meanwhile there are some Solar winds, we would be directly exposed to particles coming from the Sun...

From that point, all there was to do would have been to make a complete intuitive forces analysis, like in the video.<br><br>But while the tennis racket does the flip in just one turn around the first axis of (lowest) inertia, when rotated around the intermediate (second) axis of inertia, it would seem intuitively logical for me that even if you rotate it long enough around the lowest inertia axis (in space), a flip should eventually happen because it doesn&#39;t rotate around the axis of maximum inertia (third).<br><br>And now, as I type,  I just I remembered the T-shaped object on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VPfZ_XzisU&amp;t=5m16s\">5:16</a>, which rotates on its first axis and flips, and understood that the wing nut also rotates around the first, not the second one, like it does in the example of the tennis racket axis .

For example on the wing nut, when it is unscrewing the thread is bigger on one side than the other causing it to be unbalanced when it pops off carrying that angular momentum with it. In my mind the forces applied to unscrew will also play a roll as to how the energy is transferred causing the nut to be more energy oriented on one side than the other, I.e smacking a ruler on the ride that is hanging off the table. If all these forces were perfectly balanced and there are no instabilities will the tennis racket effect still happen. And if so why is it I can flip my phone which has the correct amount of points to pull off the effect perfectly every once in a while. I seem to be confused.<br><br><br>Update: i tested this by letting a cellphone go from a ladder onto a pillow below and used the slow motion feature on my phone to record and  was lucky enough to nail the perfect flip on my first try. eventually eventually the phone becomes unstable. I will write this off as 1. My hands are an inconsistent way of applying force and 2. The iPhone (though a nice rectangle) is an unbalanced object. Let\u2019s say I solve problems one and two by having a 100% consistent way of releasing a perfectly balanced piece of steel rectangle. I then have to deal with drag as the object comes down. This is annoying to think about since I have no way of creating a 0G environment.<br><br>I just strongly feel the methods of testing this have so many variables that using a piece of wood that is unbalanced and using your hands to flip it is a non consistent variable to apply.<br><br>Edit 3: after rewatching the video twice more I discovered there are simulations. I don\u2019t know how I missed that bit. I am satisfied with that. But I still want to test my theory.

This does match up with my intuition as I always thought that this had something to do with balancing a pencil on its sharp end, but I also find it a little bit confusing, because if this were the case, then I&#39;d also expect the flip to not be perfectly periodic, because any small change (such as the air blowing or something) could easily upset this delicate periodic &quot;balance.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T18:55:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Devin Haney", "comment_text": "So, this doesn&#39;t come into play with the poles moving?", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T17:49:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "martin518441", "comment_text": "Easy way to try this yourself , take a small knife , place the handle of the knife in your open palm , blade facing downards , pull hour hand back so you start the knife spinning in your palm , the moment you release the knife , it will spin for a moment with the blade facing down and will turn around and the blade will be spinning upwards.", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T17:15:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kamal el hodayebi", "comment_text": "Reason why Imposseble flip is hard af", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T17:04:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Klaus Oliveira", "comment_text": "Either astronauts use baby bottles or a special 9 or 10 month space study about the effects of zero gravity on fetuses was in place.", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T16:57:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Grueber", "comment_text": "Ok I am no astrophysicist but could this explain why Uranus spins on its side?", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T16:33:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SDBASSIN", "comment_text": "Need to pressure wash and reface that block wall.

So I really found this video interesting and thank you Mr. Veritasium for an excellent video (I can&#39;t find your name anywhere). My question involves the spinning earth, insofar as ancient animals have been found buried deep in the ice in Antarctica with green vegetation still in their mouths, as if there was a sudden pole shift. It appears the animals went from being located around the equator to being quickly frozen on the southern pole in a very short amount of time. It seems the planet may have experienced pole shifts in the past. Also, we don&#39;t really know what is in the center of the earth even though it is always presented as a fact that there is molten iron which keeps us magnetized to the sun...?? I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not what is happening, as molten iron loses it&#39;s magnetic properties and what about all the other planets, like gas giants, or our own moon, which is hollow? And there are other inertia pulling and pushing on the Earth as it is kept in orbit around the sun, the moon is impossibly attached to the Earth affecting tides, we are already experiencing a wobble with the procession of the equinox and the possibilities of other celestial satellites that come close by (one of them reportedly every 3600 years). The Earth spinning does not seem that stable to me. I would love it if you could help make sense of all these things.

These components provide drag-effects and tidal-effects that absorb (i.e., covert to heat) the momentae that would, in these microscopic scenarios of highly-rigid objects (e.g., wing-nuts) result in the flip. Third, the tidal force of our Moon similarly dampens any tendency to move towards a flip.

The earth is not either a uniform body, nor is it a static body in terms of mass distribution.  It is, in fact, more in kind with a bottle filled with fluid - but a fluid (molten rock - magma, and both molten and solid iron core) quite viscous.  If the question is: &quot;will the earth flip&quot; as in North Pole-South Pole axis invert relative to the plane of circulation around the sun, the answer is a qualified no - but will other elements of the earth - the light continental crusts, drifting over the mantle and redistributing mass, the convective cells within the earth&#39;s outer core and mantle, and the instability introduced by the Milankovich forces - cause internal changes such as magnetic pole reversal.  Earth really can&#39;t be considered a solid, uniform body by a long stretch.  We have abundant and undeniable evidence of both continental drift and of frequent magnetic pole reversals over recent (thousands of years) history, embedded in the rock forming either side of the ridges on the sea floor - illustrating both the instability of the earth&#39;s mass distribution and the consequences on the magnetic polarity of the dynamo that is the earth&#39;s heart.  It would be interesting to know if the phenomenon described in this video is in any way connected with the pole reversals we&#39;ve seen - and on life on earth, such as bird migrations that are dependent on navigation by magnetic polar alignment.  Given the acceleration of magnetic polar axis drift in recent years, we may be on the verge of a reversal, which would pose interesting questions on all sorts of issues, from ICBM navigation to GPS to migrations to at-sea navigation, etc. - and what I found interesting was the speed of the reversal of the spinning objects relative to the amount of time they remained in their original orientation.

Miller", "comment_text": "&quot;The earth won&#39;t flip&quot; claim is... interesting to me. As a firm believer in the Scientific Method, let me propose a hypothetical, backed by some degree of evidence, that maybe the earth <b>surface</b> is doing the flip, not the physical core or the magnetic field. I&#39;m no conspiracy person - this idea just seems interesting to me, and it intuitively correct based on the little data we have about the Earth&#39;s internals, and I just want to share it.<br><br>First: We know <b>something</b> flips. It&#39;s either the Earth&#39;s surface or the Core, since we have evidence going back the on the ocean floors showing the magnetic fields changing:<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal</a><br><br>An eyebrow raising detail of the reversals is that they are random. <br><br>Consider: The information provided in this video makes it very clear that a body whose mass changed from one axis to the other could induce the Dzhanibekov Effect.<br><br>Consider: The earths surface and upper mantle is mostly rigid, or at least certainly more rigid than the inner mantle, or at least more rigid than the fluid layer between the surface and the solid core.<br><br>Consider: It is reasonable to assume, and indeed we&#39;re getting recent data that in fact, plumes of mantle &#39;move around&#39; inside the earth.<br>gradient<br><br>indicative<br><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-researchers-track-slowly-splitting-dent-in-earth-s-magnetic-field\">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-researchers-track-slowly-splitting-dent-in-earth-s-magnetic-field</a><br><br>Consider: A powerful plume or set of plumes arrive into the upper mantel <b>and cool and solidify and stick</b> to the upper mantle. Now you have an inner core which has not had a mass angular momentum change, but an the Earth&#39;s upper mantle and surface has. The inner core is mostly unperturbed, but the outer mantel and surface are now newly exposed to the Dzhanibekov Effect. The outer core has gone from rotationally spherical to rotationally tennis racket.<br><br>Could it be the outside surface of the earth is what flips during Geomagnetic reversal, rather than the core or the magnetism of the core? It kinda seems more reasonable that the surface flips, because I&#39;m guessing the inner core of the earth is <b>way</b> more massive than the externals of the earth. <br><br>Also the randomness of the planetary scale heat plumes - matching those of a lava lamp - would be random. Which is lovely since we even use lava lamps to help us generate truly random numbers:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cUUfMeOijg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cUUfMeOijg</a><br><br>It seems much more likely that the core would be more stable and the lighter outer portions of the earth are what would be flipped.<br><br>Let&#39;s hypothesize for a moment and say it was the outer surface of the planet that flipped. (north to south) with the core remaining un altered. What evidence would there be to prove that on the surface of the earth? Obviously the magnetic record on the see floor - but that doesn&#39;t tell you want flipped, just that the magnetic field changed relative to the surface. <br><br>What archaeological evidence would prove the <b>surface</b> flipped? For example, Is there any known archaeological method to know what direction the sun came from? Say like &#39;Hey at this time it was supposed to be winter here but it looks like it was summer, and stayed that way for a few thousand years&#39;. No - that would be useless, because even if you could, it would be affected by seasons, but they&#39;re affected by seasons anyway - you&#39;d have to have precision down to the year across a data set spanning millions. Too little signal to noise ratio no? You could be staring at the archeological showing sun direct data over cycling annual seasons, but you&#39;d have no way of knowing if you were 6 months off.<br><br>I&#39;m not currently aware of any method for humans to know aggregate periodic surface angles to the sun with that precision past the time of the most recent flip.<br><br>Does anyone else out there know of a way? Even one way will prove this idea wrong.<br><br>Sure... it is possible that it&#39;s the core flipping because <b>its</b> mass changes. But by what process? I&#39;d like to hear an intuitive description of any core flipping or pole flipping, just like this video provided such an intuitive explanation of the Dzhanibekov Effect.<br><br>The plume process affecting the outer mass of the earth and cooling seems ... more intuitive and likely to me at the moment. <br><br>Yay science!", "comment_date": "2020-08-28T01:12:02Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Chris Heichel", "comment_text": "If it was spinning on that access around the bar would that bar bend if it spun fast enough?", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T23:18:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DavidFMayerPhD", "comment_text": "It is also in &quot;Classical Mechanics&quot; by Herbert Goldstein.", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T22:38:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael james", "comment_text": "STOP THAT!!!!!

As a fresh AE (aerospace engineer) I admit that I haven&#39;t come into knowledge about this interesting physical, yet incredibly simple phenomena (until you understand the small unexpected ingredient which creates it, it first appears weird and non-logic) until I saw this video! I&#39;m not looking to criticize the vectors representation on the small point masses, but if they were to represent the acceleration magnitudes, those should&#39;ve probably been greatest only when the disc would be at 45 degrees from the reference plane and become zero at 0 and 90 degrees. Those look only like instantaneous force or velocity vectors! Indeed, the inertial (or the fictitious centrifugal) forces of the small point masses are the greatest at 90 deg and zero at 0 deg, so they make sense as force vectors, but speaking about accelerations only, at 90 deg there is zero arm to generate any rotating moment about the X axis (if we take X passing through the great masses) and at 0 degrees there&#39;s the greatest arm, but virtually zero inertial forces to apply to the small point masses. From this it would make sense to me that at exactly 45 deg, the acceleration is highest (as there&#39;s the highest product between arm and inertial forces) and goes towards and reaches zero at 90. This also makes me conclude (if indeed at 45 the acceleration is highest) that the acceleration is a tangent function of the relative angle between the disc and the reference plane. Please correct me if my theory is wrong stating that only at 45 degrees inclination, the acceleration is highest.<br><br>This has great implications for all 3 inertial axis objects, such as space objects or even my beloved airplanes=). From this I can conclude that if a fighter plane which starts developing a pitch rate but the Y (wings plane axis) axis is having a high enough offset angle (less than 5 degrees can be enough high) from the real axis about which the whole plane is purely rotating (so not the actual pitch axis), the higher the pitch rate or the higher the offset angle (basically you can think of it as a dot product between them) will eventually make the plane flip-roll 180 degrees. This now validates why I was seeing MIG-29 OVT&#39;s or Su-35s unexpected and surely not pilot intended 180 degrees rolling motions half way through a Kulbit maneuver (a fast pitch up rate 360 degrees pitch rotation).<br><br>Here is at least one possible example (it may be due to a brief asymmetric lift between the wings as much as for our subject&#39;s phenomena) of this non-commanded effect which affects the plane&#39;s reactions, similar to the tennis-racket:<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/y8qmkLcXua0?t=179\">https://youtu.be/y8qmkLcXua0?t=179</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T07:29:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "midi510", "comment_text": "All the names he presented are wrong, It&#39;s the hammer theorem.", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T06:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Hood", "comment_text": "Yes because the Earth is round but fat at the equator so that is the maximum inertia point so there you have it flipping Truth \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T04:39:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TJ Rubicon", "comment_text": "I have watched this three times over the past few months.

I often observed this phenomenon flipping phones, skateboards, and knives. I used to wonder why I couldn&#39;t flip things in the air without that secondary rotation happening, despite attempts at trying to correct for what intuitively seemed an error in forces I was exerting. After watching this video, my observations make perfect sense. Seeing the rotation actually matches my new/corrected intuition. Even before getting to the part in the video where they explain how dude was able to describe the phenomenon in a way that would make intuitive sense, I had a hazy idea of it in mind. The idea came from noticing the acceleration and deceleration of the flipping motion. I was thinking it must have something to do with a very slight offset in weight distribution on different ends of the axis of rotation. Unnoticeable in the beginning but due to centrifugal force, exponentially greater. Hence, if you can make an object spin perfectly upon its intermediate axis, it would never flip. The object would probably have to be completely rigid and the flip performed in a vacuum without any other forces acting on it. Something like magnetism or air resistance could make the most minute change off axis and centrifugal force would eventually and exponentially cause it to flip, and the momentum(near insignificant initially) of that spin would carry it back to and past spinning near perfectly on the 2nd axis over and over", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T13:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ishan Pednekar", "comment_text": "Terrence Tao gives tons of interviews for Numberphile but declines for Veritasium<br><br>Wow", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T10:53:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "gautham vijayan", "comment_text": "But how is it periodic ??", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T05:18:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FranktheDachshund", "comment_text": "Hang on, if the ice caps melted, could that change the earth&#39;s moment of inertia possibly allowing it to flip?<br>And am I right in assuming a flip would cause a major problem for the inhabitants.", "comment_date": "2020-08-21T01:00:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Gavin", "comment_text": "Great video and explanation - just on LastPass, how many passwords do you need to get into it?

Have any experiments been done with this effect relative to the solar system&#39;s or Earth&#39;s rotation (i.e., trying it at various rotational axes relative to earth&#39;s/solar system rotational axes?)

The katana (samurai sword) operates this way ( and the tachi before it, also works this way). This is most likely the reason it&#39;s curved and stiff.

It&#39;s takes almost no effort and is one of the aspects of the weapon that made it so terrifying to face: you have absolutely no idea where the strike is coming from. Two samurai could be walking toward one another, holding their weapons one way, and in the quarter step before coming within range of each other, reposition and launch the weapon from someplace it wouldn&#39;t have seemed possible.<br><br>This technique only works with curved blades.

Since the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and nor does it have a perfectly balanced mass in space, it&#39;s possible it can flip-over/reverse poles. It&#39;s a &#39;relatively&#39; stable spheric mass in space (in regards to overall mass distribution from the inner-core up until the outer crustal layer). But what we&#39;re really talking about here/what matters to us is the outer/crustal layer. Since it&#39;s floating on the middle layer (Magma), it&#39;s susceptible to flipping-over/pole reversal. Deep-core ice &amp; rock drilling samples which reveal evidence Millions of years into Earth&#39;s past have shown that Earth&#39;s poles have flipped/reversed many times in it&#39;s past, with regularity. The &#39;liquid nature&#39; of most of inner Earth (Magma) surrounding the core/mantle and comprising a large amount of Earth&#39;s overall mass,  (liquid being in perpetual motion), somewhat helps to counteract the increased frequency of possible flip-over, almost like an &#39;internal gyroscope&#39; counteracting the &#39;external gyroscope.&#39; The Earth is also wider, and hence more dense at the Equatorial zone, almost like a spinning top. The question is does this fact mathematically further enhance or decrease it&#39;s frequency of crustal flip-over/reversing poles whilst floating on a liquid layer of perpetual motion. Counter-intuitively and going against science as we know it (in regards to spinning masses in space and the &#39;perfect sphere/mass&#39; theory), it may actually help to counteract the frequency of potential crustal movement.", "comment_date": "2020-07-24T15:41:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "r q", "comment_text": "There is a follow up video on this topic on the channel &#39;stand up maths&#39; which is definitely worth a watch", "comment_date": "2020-07-24T15:23:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Inno Park", "comment_text": "Aaahh... such a relief to know the earth won&#39;t flip !!!<br>2020: Challenge Accepted!!!", "comment_date": "2020-07-24T06:51:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vamsi krishnan", "comment_text": "i am sure this rotation differs when in Vacuum !!!", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T17:47:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K", "comment_text": "that stationary rotating view made me motion sick", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T16:46:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gadgetman", "comment_text": "Does that mean that technically if you could spin the wingnut absolutely perfectly you wouldn&#39;t get this effect?", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T13:40:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DTV", "comment_text": "If a large asteroid hit the earth could that cause the earth to rotate differently?", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T05:31:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperAWaC", "comment_text": "I appreciate the effort and visualization but Feynman is still right.", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T04:58:05Z", "likes_count": 71}, {"comment_by": "Be Ren", "comment_text": "Is this how objects in space are able to move on their own?", "comment_date": "2020-07-22T23:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jonne Westerlund", "comment_text": "Why have the Polarity ( &quot;plus/minus&quot; ), poles, of Earth changed over time it&#39;s lifespan?

This Terry Tao explanation implies that if an object can be spun absolutely perfectly about its intermediate axis, it will not perform the intermittent flipping effect.  This phenomenon touches on a far wider phenomenon known as &quot;design sensitivity&quot;.  Any engineer designing anything has to evaluate the effect on their device of a particular magnitude of change to any of the hundreds/thousands of parameters that make up their device, an example would be an overly touchy throttle where a tiny fluctuation of the throttle produces an unexpectedly large acceleration, or in electrical terms, to much &quot;gain&quot; in the circuit.  Some engineers assign &quot;criticality&quot; levels to all aspects of their designs.<br><br>As an adjunct mechanical engineering professor, I have been demonstrating this &quot;Dzhanibekov&quot; phenomenon since 2012 in a machine design course I teach (I knew nothing until today about Mr. Dzhanibekov).  I use a simple rectangular wooden block from a children&#39;s wooden block set and I color coded the sides much like you color coded your tennis racket.  Perhaps like you, I was tipped off on this phenomenon by an engineering book that stated that objects spin in an unstable fashion about their intermediate axis.  Later I, like you, I stumbled on the first international space station video you showed where an astronaut carefully imparts a spin to a special T-handle causing it to unscrew itself from a panel (maybe you saw this video first).  The fact that the T handle spends the first several rotations unscrewing itself is important to this video since that keeps the T-handle aligned such that it &quot;launches&quot; off the panel relatively well aligned to the intermediate spin axis, meaning that it takes many revolutions for the Dzhanibekov effect to initiate and which makes the international space station video look creepy and interesting.<br><br>I was unaware of cosmonaut Dzhanibekov and his similar spinning wing  nut observations, but there again, because his wing nut had the chance to spin about its intermediate axis in a relatively aligned fashion due to its start on the threaded rod, when it was ejected off of the end of the threaded rod, it took quite a few rotations for this effect to occur and made the effect much more pronounced and interesting to cosmonaut Dzhanibekov.<br><br>So, the key point in the Terry tau explanation is that during the flip portion of this phenomenon and for the first 90\u00b0 of the flip, the lesser masses of the object in the Terry Tau explanation, which are initially centered on the intermediate axis of rotation, experience increasing forces in a direction that promotes the flipping but, and as you pointed out, the critical and fun fact is that for the next 90\u00b0 of the flipping event, the forces acting on the lesser masses in the Terry tau explanation experience a decelerating force which attempts to realign them to the original spinning position about the intermediate axis at which point the phenomenon starts all over again. <br><br>So, The more you carefully initially align the spin of the object about its intermediate axis, and the smaller the smaller-masses are in the Terry Tau explanation, the longer the spinning object will spin about the intermediate axis between flipping episodes.<br><br>Ever since I started puzzling over this phenomenon, my mind did not jump to the spinning earth issue that you say so worried the Russians (they probably were also mulling over any military applications of this phenomenon in terms of rotating projectiles including rockets, like the tumbling rocket issue that befell that early USA rocket you talked about), but to tall rectangular sky scrapers.  In my mind, I was concerned that if such sky scrapers are being spun by the rotating earth about their intermediate axis, I wondered if there was an unplanned for torque being exerted upon their foundations.  The Terry Tao explanation answers this question - yes, there is a torque and the magnitude of the torque is related to the angle of the rectangular skyscraper to the earth&#39;s spin axis (would be fun to write out the formula for the Dzhanibekov torque acting for such tall structures).  If the rectangular sky scraper is aligned correctly, the torque is zero, but there are other alignments where a, perhaps, measurable torque is generated.<br><br>I doubt that building designers know about or account for this torque, but it would be interesting to correlate problematic sky scrapers, for example, ones that experience glass cracking (due to the unplanned for torque on the building) more than other sky scrapers.   Or, perhaps the torque on a misaligned sky scraper is small and &quot;not of engineering significance&quot;. <br><br>On a somewhat related cool physics note, to this day, uninformed people blame the Coriolis force on everything including the direction water spins as it goes down a toilet.  Calmer minds have long ago proved that the spin direction of the vortex of water draining down through small household round drains has more to due with the directions of the machining marks left on the metal drain than whether or not you are in the Northern or Southern hemisphere.  BTW, there is a funny Simpson&#39;s cartoon episode where the USA Australian embassy, according to the cartoon show, installed hydro jets to force the toilets in the USA Australian embassy to spin the good old Yankee way (ha ha).<br><br>Thanks again for a thoughtfully produced and well explained video.", "comment_date": "2020-07-16T17:50:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "icinema gr", "comment_text": "BULLSITO  spining is space what space you liers", "comment_date": "2020-07-16T13:07:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammed Shabin", "comment_text": "Feynman was right all along....\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2020-07-16T11:47:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "@RipeN", "comment_text": "What we change the axis of rotation to larger masses then using same anology we can prove that pure rotation through the other non intermediate axis is also impossible.i hope u answer my question", "comment_date": "2020-07-16T06:06:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chintan", "comment_text": "Awesome!

Isn&#39;t this the same set of forces that keeps a rotating bicycle wheel vertical when it rotates?  Its well-known that when you replace tires on your car you have the wheel balanced before taking to the road so that the plane of rotation of the wheel is maintained to a mechanically sound level.  Unbalanced, the wheel will cease to rotate around the desired axis and cause wear on the bearings.  Of course, there&#39;s little need to rotate a wheel in space but when you do rotate an object in space alone I would think that one would get a uniform unbalance, balance, unbalance, balance effect because of the near impossibility of having an absolutely perfect mass distribution in any manufactured object.

I would be at a loss to explain it mathematically, that is true, but I&#39;ve worked on enough gyroscopic instruments in my days at sea and also in the air that it simply seems we&#39;ve not broadly extended our prediction of phenomenon to rotating bodies in which there are few external forces acting on it.

Those inkwells were a LOOSE FIT in their wooden sockets, so they could be slipped out for filling with ink. Also, a kid could jiggle them about to make a REALLY annoying noise, \u00ecf he had a mind to.<br>Well, I found that if I put my index finger in the hole in the middle of a dry inkwell, and then moved that inkwell around against its socket in a circular path...<br><br>... NOT twisting my finger, you understand, but moving it in a circular orbit, like driving a disc round on a turntable...<br><br>... then something very odd happened.<br><br>As I moved my finger in a circle - pressing the inkwell against the side wall of its socket - the &#39;well immediately began a rotation of its OWN. It twisted itself around on my finger, <b>BUT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, AND AT ABOUT 1/5th MY CIRCLING SPEED.</b><br><br>Yes. If I moved my finger in a circular orbit clockwise, the inkwell would bear against its socket and twist around on my finger, (and in the socket) in an anti-clockwise direction, but slowly... as I remember about 1/5 or 1/4  speed. Anyway, it was certainly always the same proportion of my circular rotating rate. <br>If I reversed my direction of circling, the inkwell also immediately reversed and went the other way, at that same slower speed.<br><br>I hope I have explained this strange behaviour in terms that can be understood.<br><br>I have never met anybody who ever noticed this, or gave other examples of it, let alone being able to explain it to me.

I have a conundrum here! Please help me to live a decent life, cause I can&#39;t sleep nights anymore! :)<br>A simple answer to this post will do, but even better would be making a video about the physics that happens in the inner core - subatomic center of a spinning object! I searched on the internet, but couldn&#39;t find an exhaustive explanation of the phenomenon. My opinion is that, knowing that an atom is made 99,99% of empty space, somehow that infinitesimal small center point must find itself in that empty space and somehow every other matter (proton and neutron) or particles (electrons) spins around that point. I found this to be a plausible explanation, but, what happens if the object is larger and that axis passes through billions and bilions of attoms? What if on a certain point, axis hit the nucleus of an atom? Has the nature a law to solve the problem? As far as i digged on this, I do not understand how can an spinning object have 0 velocity at center! That means that at the center, some attoms are at rest and others are spinning around them! This Is friction and friction produces heat, not to mention some posibile decay of the object for the simple fact that is spinning.

Here is my hypothesis. The bigger point mass in your example will move side to side in the same plain as the biggest moment of inertia. Because it is unstable. This side to side movement causes the small point masses to move in a spiral. As the acceleration grows bigger in the spiral the force on the small point mas grows bigger. When it gets big enough the object will flip over. Initially, the &quot;flip&quot; is assisted by the side movement of the bigger point masses as it moves through 90 deg. The side to side force opposes the &quot;flip&quot; force. Dissipates the &quot;flip&quot; force until it is zero. We are now 180 deg from where we started and our spiral starts again. Like you. I am fascinated by the intermediate axis theorem. I think proving that an axis is unstable is not describing the movement of the object or axis. That is why physicists find it impossible to describe in a simple manner. I think there is a relationship between the difference in the inertia of the intermediate axis and smallest inertia axis, in terms of how fast the spiral grows. In other words how fast it flips. The unstable spinning top a good example of the movement of the unstable intermediate axis. I hope this is a simple explanation of the movement of the unstable axis.

This guy is only talking about solid objects. The book, Mars, asteroids and that ball of clay. The water bottle is different, but it doesn&#39;t represent the earth properly. The earth is a solid core surrounded by a viscous fluid with a hard shell. The rotation of the shell is caused by friction from the fluid. The core is spinning faster so there is drag pulling the fluid along which in turn drags the shell. Same principle as the Tesla turbine. A nickel/iron body takes a lot more energy to break the <a href=\"http://inertia.it/\">inertia.It</a> has a higher inertial potential than the fluid or the shell. The Dzhanibekov Effect will happen. The core will flip and so will the magnetic field. The fluid will get turbulent an the shell will shift, but by how much is any one&#39;s guess.

In other words the rotation is a magnetic field building up until it reaches critical mass and then it changes Direction because now the polarity is changed because it&#39;s reached critical mass. It&#39;s absorbed all the velocity or momentum that it could possibly take to go in One Direction and therefore it cannot take anymore and so that it automatically must go in the other direction just like a electromagnetic plate taking all the ions that it can absorb before changes its direction or jumps the Gap to the next conductor. So what you could do if you really want to play with it it&#39;s take a magnet into zero gravity and see if it flips but a magnet that is spherical in nature. I guess you really don&#39;t need a magnet. But it basically means that the shape of the electromagnetic field dictates whether it would act as a capacitor or not. So basically around plate wouldn&#39;t have the same electromagnetic Dynamics as a flat plate. And only because of the axis point of gravity in the plate. So if it only had one point and not three.

But, let&#39;s just think about it. We have an iron core that NEEDS to be perfectly spherical in order to keep spinning like it does providing the earth with a magnetic field, and a celestial body that can have mass anywhere on it&#39;s surface. By the way, only one is accessible by the outside universe because it&#39;s protected by the outside celestial body. So...which one is more likely to develop an intermediary axis? <br><br><br>Well... I suppose that an large enough opposing magnetic field could make it flip..... But what besides the sun would have enough energy to do that all the while not making the earth inhabitable?", "comment_date": "2019-11-04T07:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt m", "comment_text": "Has anyone tried a liquid filled sphere at zero gravity?

Now this Effect is still not properly understood by Everyone 30 years Later. His auto response was both wise and humble at the time. His disposition was wonderfully positive and humorous, where he never claimed to be a Mr Knowitall (W.Somerset Maugham). I hope Derek didn&#39;t mean to demean the great lecturer as he did and in hindsight of the many passionate responses would&#39;ve worded it differently. But getting back to the science, After 30 years I seem to be the Only Person who has taken this effect to the next level.<br><br>Let me explain.<br>In &#39;92 I independently noticed this Anomaly (Like thousands of others) during my self funded experimentation between moonlighting as a plumber. I was already 5 years into developing my own Unified Theory Of Everything. Though I shelved it, I kept going back to it. By &#39;96 I&#39;d proven the pole shift was not due to aerodynamic forces, as another had commented previously, but was proportional to it&#39;s mass density and spin. Shelved it again. By &#39;03 revisited it and showed a Theoretical Physicist friend of mine, who again wasn&#39;t aware of the phenomena and encouraged me to continue. Finally after showing this Effect to over 100 people I made some headway when approaching UniMelb Mech Eng. Dept. in 2010. The Prof. tried reciprocating the effect on their simulator to no avail!<br>Well that was a rush in itself. A good feeling knowing my gut was on the right path to pursue understanding the effect. After seeing me throw a steel tetra in the foreyard outside his office, he gave me a students instruction on Mech Eng, which he authored and told me to get back to him with the results.<br>Well 8 years later I finally got around to forking out $4,000 and three more models later produced what you see on the Video today. Unfortunately the Prof had retired or moved on and trying to find the right people who had the qualifications to verify my findings isn&#39;t easy. It&#39;s not your average problem!<br>Well 6 months after publishing my experiment at my utube channel along come Derek with a good knowledge of the past history of attempts at identifying and quantifying this Effect, which is why I&#39;m here. See prior to the moment Terry Tao was commissioned to work out the math I had already worked out it&#39;s relationship with Solar Mass&#39;s and proceeded to publish the findings in my 2nd Edition of the Periodic Table which was to incorporate the G.O.O.D Theory and introduce a new Law of Physics P = ms . That in itself was drama, was rorted  another $4k by a rogue who called himself a Graphic Artist and resolved to shelve the second edition and reprinted the original &#39;97 copy instead, due to lack of funds and the need to replenish stock.<br>Well you could imagine my outrage when I was only just recently humiliated by the Morons at MathOverflow by informing their community of my Verified findings prior to their &#39;Golden Boys&#39; so called work of Genius!<br>Well after all that Math and 8 years later the very same Morons still Failed to recognise nor identify what I had done 20 years ago and professionally verified 9 years ago. 1 year prior to Tao&#39;s commission!<br><br>Now thats Arrogance for you. Their argument was that at Math Overflow only direct answers to the problem (regarding  whether it can be expressed using Eulers method) can be posted.<br>Regardless my abstract correction of added information (8 years after the original post mind you) was just way too much for certain autistic impatient moronic mathematicians.<br>Well I don&#39;t expect that attitude will change in the near future.

I mean, it just seems intuitive to me. Nothing is perfect. No spin is without perterbation. But here there&#39;s a balancing effect. A flywheel. But still, in essence you have a balanced rod on a point: easy in principal in a wind-free environment. But impossible in practice. Always an imperfection. Slightly more one way or another.<br><br><br>Well then think chaos theory. Chaotic systems (which is really any system outside of a lab: think the three-body problem) always build up perterbations. Black swan theory. Things are balanced until they&#39;re not. The flywheel corrects the minor perterbations until they build up to a big enough one, which they do on a regular interval, different for each system, dependent on the geometry and velocity (initial conditions, but with limits and constraints).<br><br><br>This might all be a load of crap, i dont know. Not a physicist. Let alone a classical mechanics specialist. Just a knee-jerk reaction. A gut intuition. It gets out of balance but doesnt just start tumbling. It pulls the flywheel into a new, temporary stability.<br><br><br>Like bouncing. We could look at it as just a complex bouncing ball.<br><br><br>Of course the ball suddenly changes directions. When it hits the ground it doesn&#39;t go everywhere, it goes into a new, stable net momentum. And then gravity smoothly brings it back to the ground via a continuous deceleration, really only looks like it changes direction on paper.

Like the mantle, the inner core is also an oblate ellipsoid and rotates within the liquid outer core slightly faster east than the  crust/mantle. This raises the prospect of an inversion of the inner core  independently of the  crust/mantle .  It also suggests that magnetic field reversal (in the magnetic outer core) could be a consequence of the physical inversion of the non-magnetic inner core .\r<br>\r<br>The earth&#39;s crust/mantle has a 26000 year period of its 23.5\u00b0 wobble.  If this wobble is spiraling (to or away from its wobble-pole) then it could well result in a slow flip of the earth over in a just few more wobble cycles (50,000 years). \r Likewise, the magnetic (outer core) pole is drifting north west relative to the earth&#39;s surface, while the earth&#39;s inner core has a 60 year period of rotation east in a 10\u00b0 wobble relative to the earth&#39;s mantle. However the magnetic north pole is (geologically) accelerating north west at high speed and if the  Dzhanibekov effect is thrown into the mix then a model could be devised showing the earth is indeed entering a period of high instability of its magnetic field due to interactions between the eccentric inverting inner core, the magnetic outer core and the rotation of the mantle.\r<br>\r<br>This is not just a likely scenario. Almost every large object in our solar system revolves and rotates in an anti-clockwise direction. Uranus however has an almost horizontal (98\u00b0) inclination off the vertical making it either a rare clockwise rotation or inverted and just over half way through an inversion cycle. Venus is completely retrograde (clockwise) suggesting it has re-stabilised in the inverted state. Pluto sits at 120\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 retrograde.

If all was balanced and specs, dimentions  were correct, why was there this radical shaking as we passed certain speeds? There would appear a hard shaking at 3000 rpm and a secondary vibration at a higher speed. Hmmm ? It seemed out of order because everything we did was to balance all the parts and get things set within a thousanth or 3 of an inch. Yet still there would be this huge radical shaking. One possibility would be &#39;metal sag&#39; throwing things out of balance due to setting for a few days in the same position. And another i imagine because of the temperature differences on the upper &quot;exposed&quot;  half and the other half which may be still be inside the case like in the case of a giant turbine say for power generation.

I&#39;d actually noticed this one some tie ago, fiddling with a T-shaped object, and spinning it as shown while tossing it in the air, and noticing exactly the same motion - apparently spinning &quot;upright up&quot;, then &quot;upright down&quot;, with rapid transition between the two states. I have now idea how many times I tossed that thing trying to work out what was going on! In the end,  I came to basically the conclusion you describe - that the middle of the T accelerates rapidly through the plane of spin and only slowly toward the poles, giving the illusion that it&#39;s flipping between two stable states.<br><br><br>(I should point out that my university mathematics career ended in stage 1 with the words, &quot;what math test?&quot;, so I was thinking about the motion without actually doing the math, just an intuitive idea of how the accelerations work - pretty much the same line of reasoning as you describe...)<br><br><br><br>Had no idea that it baffled rocket scientists!<br><br><br>How dos this relate to inertial coupling, the effect that caused (or contributed to) the loss of the X-2 in 1956? My understanding is that if an aircraft is rolls &quot;off axis (i.e. the axis of roll is not down the &quot;long axis&quot; of the aircraft, the ends will tend to accelerate outwards - that&#39;s OK on most aircraft with long wings, where the acceleration of the wings counters the off-angle acceleration of the nose and tail. With an aircraft like the X-2 where the wings are stubby and thin (and light), the acceleration of the nose and tail overwhelms that of the wings, causing the aircraft behave like the T in our little experiment, and if not damped by the empennage and control surfaces, the aircraft can violently swap ends, just like our spinning T-handle. <br><br><br>I thought that effect was pretty well studied by aerodynamicists in the mid-late 1950s - in fact Mel Apt was working on that exact problem until he was killed in the X-2, and the same affect nearly killed Chuck Yeager in the X-1A in 1953.<br><br><br>Or have I missed a trick on this one?

That disturbance could be nothing more than a small 26000 year wobble, which the Earth just so happens to have. If this wobble is spiraling (to or away from its wobble-pole) then it could well result in a slow flip of the earth over in a just few more wobble cycles (50,000 years). <br><br>This is not just a likely scenario. Almost every large object in our solar system revolves and rotates in an anti-clockwise direction. Uranus however has an almost horizontal (98\u00b0) inclination off the vertical making it either a rare clockwise rotation or inverted and just over half way through an inversion cycle. Venus is completely retrograde (clockwise) suggesting it has re-stabilised in the inverted state. Pluto sits at 120\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 retrograde. All the other planets have about 25\u00b0 wobble except Jupiter at 3\u00b0, and only Mercury has no significant wobble (0\u00b0).<br><br>Planetary inversion is a real phenomenon, that can happen in at least the extreme circumstances demonstrated by the Russian cosmonaut.

That is, it is the moment of inertia times the angular velocity for the axis about which the object is spinning.  The angular momentum is constant because there are no external torques acting on the body.  So if you compare angular momentum about the different axes, you get:<br><br><br>H = I_1 omega_1 = I_2 omega_2 = I_3 omega_3<br><br><br>Now the angular kinetic energy is 1/2 I omega^2.  That&#39;s very analogous to linear kinetic energy, 1/2 m V^2.  <br><br><br>Notice that you can substitute the constant angular momentum into this equation for angular kinetic energy.  You get:<br><br><br>KE = 1/2  H omega<br><br><br>H is the constant angular momentum.  So this lets you see why the kinetic energy is greatest when spinning about the axis with the minimum moment of inertia, because that has the highest angular velocity.   And when you spin about the axis with the maximum moment of inertia, you have the lowest spin rate.  So that gives you the lowest kinetic energy.  That&#39;s why the body will always end up spinning about that axis if there is any way for the body to dissipate energy.  <br><br><br>The flexible antennas on Explorer 1 did that.  Any wiggling of the original spin axis caused those antennas to flex.  as they flexed, they reacted moments back into the body and those moments change the angular velocity of the body.  It&#39;s almost like a precession caused by those tiny moments acting on the body if you think of that body as being separate from the antennas.  And similarly, the reaction moments acting on the base of the antennas caused them to wiggle.  So the bodies and the antennas interact and drive each other whenever there is wobbling of the spin axis.  <br><br><br>The flexing makes heat and the heat radiates out to space.

While this is a common term, the gravity experienced by astronauts is almost full Earth gravity. Things just float about because they&#39;re in freefall, constantly falling. It&#39;s like being in a falling lift, in a long enough lift shaft things would seem like they were floating. Or in the &quot;vomit comet&quot; aeroplanes like in this video, where the aeroplane dives and it seems like gravity is switched off. <br><br>In orbit, a spacecraft is constantly falling, pulled toward the Earth by gravity. It&#39;s also constantly moving forward, with the inertia from the movement it&#39;s engines gave it during launch. If you just launch a rocket straight up, it falls straight back down again. So rockets tilt over and start moving sideways, at 90 degrees to the Earth, then start moving that way. <br><br>So they fall at the same speed everything else does. It&#39;s just that when they&#39;ve fallen, say, a metre, they&#39;ve also moved forwards a bit. Enough that the Earth&#39;s surface, being round, is a metre further beneath them. This keeps going, through inertia, Newton&#39;s first law, keeping the craft moving forward, and gravity keeping that inertia from sending the craft off into deep space. The gravitational pull and the forward movement are in balance. <br><br>(I realise Mr Veritasium knows this)<br><br>Point is a lot of people, as I used to, think there&#39;s just less gravity in space, cos it&#39;s too far away from Earth.

What i did not notice or expect was that it would work, sure enough when i attached engines to each end of the side facing weight and activated them just until the point of the axis changing the craft would flip 180&#39; every few seconds. However the most interesting part I did not notice was the change in rotational direction when the craft flipped. I,e when the craft was started to spin looking at it from a southern position facing north the craft would be rotating clockwise and after the flip the craft was not rotating anti-clockwise.

I noticed this behavior many years ago as a kid, trying to figure out and understand certain skateboard flip tricks. I have no formal physics education, I just like to think about things\u2026 but it seems to me that there is a hierarchy of stability in rotational axes, where mass = stability. In the disc example, the 4 points of mass rotating around Z is always the most stable, with the least amount of inherent wobble. And comparing the X and Y axes, where there is mass on the axis line, the one with more mass on the axis line will always be the most stable. So in this example, Y, the intermediate axis, is the weakest of the 3 rotational axes, because there is less mass on the Y axis line than there is spinning around it (on the X axis). This allows centrifugal forces to cause the wobbling mass on the Y axis line to run away from the axis, and thusly to rotate around the next strongest axis in the hierarchy, which is X.\r<br>Ultimately though, it should come down to uneven weight distribution and wobble. In theory, under perfect conditions, an object could spin around the intermediate axis without flipping... An absolutely perfectly symmetrical object, with perfectly uniform density, in a zero gravity vacuum, spun perfectly on that axis without the slightest amount of wobble, would rotate without flipping. But we can&#39;t create those conditions, so I think there will ALWAYS be a wobble in ANY object\u2019s rotation, which is why this effect always occurs. \r<br>Also, why do you say that centripetal force is the only force acting on the mass points? Isn&#39;t that incorrect? I don&#39;t believe that centripetal force actually draws mass inwards, centripetal force is simply the amount of force required to resist the outward pull of centrifugal force, is it not?

A black hole is the conjuntion point of several large, powerfull, gravity/static and magnetic fields. They hook together at a sweet spot and since they are rotating at such a high speed they arent pulled together. This causes a resonating field that becomes so powerfull it just sucks everything in including light maybe. Since ive never seen a black hole i dont know if it really exists. As all the matter is pulled in its crushed and ripped apart spewing lots of energy out of it probably where there isn&#39;t a &quot;gravity&quot; field. Eventually the material being crushed by the resonating interlocked gravity fields escapes and because of the way it was formed it has a very powerfull &quot;gravity&quot; field.\u00a0 This globe then gets ejected and depending on its strenght it gathers dirt dust and debris to it rather quickly. <br><br>Just so you science nerds know i already have my stuff registered and have designs for a gravity globe for classrooms so school children can play with sand and water and buildings on a globe on a desk.

So easy to understand why. If an object is simetric in shape and weight distribution is equal like a round object, then it will spin in one way, if it&#39;s not then it has a different centre of gravity. The tennis racket is stupid though cause your hand does not spin it in a perfect motion, you&#39;re twisting the racket without realizing cause the force you apply is negligible for you to feel. And if objects are not round you won&#39;t be able to spin it around just one axis. Even a machine will have errors.  And even round objects can have 2 axis if the object&quot; has a bump or pretuberance( hope i spelled correctly) ,or even a hole (not in the centre) or ...doesn&#39;t have to be a hole..., imagine a round cookie that somebody took a bite of, or cut a slice off. There&#39;s no such thing as a perfect round object, but if it&#39;s round enough( don&#39;t know the proportions in balance and frankly it can&#39;t be calculated, just approximated) then the big axis will ignore the rest of the smaller axis, which are infinite.

I know spacecraft are much more complicated than any object demonstrated in this video, but the working principle could make it possible to do this with a more complex object, right? <br>Something like this would be interesting for a constant takeoff and reentry vehicle. Say it&#39;s conical with a dished bottom. It&#39;d be aerodynamically efficient for atmospheric takeoff, and doing the flip would make reentry possible, and could use the thruster for landing. This would reduce the amount of auxiliary thrusters needed for maneuvers like braking and flipping the nose and tail to opposite sides. I know this isn&#39;t the best example, but lets say the craft approaches reentry with it&#39;s nose before flipping, to make this a valid use case of the concept; which would also work in the case of traveling to multiple bodies, whether they have an atmosphere or not.<br>I know this is a lot of what-if&#39;s, speculation, ideas, and science fiction since we don&#39;t have a space craft that can take off without massive amounts of thrust and fuel.

Firstly, with liquid, it is not system with 3 free way of motion (3 rotations). Liquid is not rigid body. Btw, angular momentum is vector, and kinetic energy is scalar.  And, if kinetic energy always decrease (which result in stop of rotation eventually), how can then angular momentum still have some value?<br>My explanation, with thinking about 10-15 mins, is something like this. Both angular momentum and kinetic energy change, both decrease. In same way like, when you let some amount of water (or some other viscous fluid) in some channel or pipe. Little forces on particles from viscosity will decrease velocity gradually and whole momentum. And that same forces times dx (Work) will decrease kinetic energy, which will go in temperature. But why it flips to rotation of biggest angular momentum? Because liquid can move, and because of centrifugal forces, goes furthest as possible from axis.<br><br><br><br><br>Hope you will see this comment.", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T07:30:45Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Beren Dohan", "comment_text": "Um, I broke down this video carefully.

I mean, our basic orientation centered on the Equator is merely a convenient one, and not based on a &quot;fixed&quot; point on the nearby universe. And the supposed &quot;pause&quot; in movement and redirection of the Earth&#39;s rotation on the apex of the flip could be explained by our perception of time through Quantum Physics. I know, our planet turns from the left to the right and there&#39;s no sign it ever went the other way, but that too could be something explained solely from our perspective on the surface of the lithosphere. Actual signs of flipping are only detectable for us today through our measurements of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field and/or gravitational anomalies, not on a conventional spatial way. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m obviously not a theoretical physicist. But I suppose there could be something there along these lines.

Hi, Zagros.<br>Nice find.<br>The clip illustrates a classical result of the rotational dynamics of an object with three unequal axes of symmetry (like a rectangular block of uneven sides), called the &quot;intermediary axis theorem&quot;. It is more like a corollary of the model describing the rotation of an object as a set of coupled rotations projected about three rectangular axes of symmetry. It states that, while the rotations about axes parallel to the largest and smallest sides are stable under small perturbations, the rotations about the intermediary axis will be unstable. That is, if the object is spun around axes parallel with the larger and smallest sides (like the length and thin height of your mobile) and the rotation is slightly perturbed, the perturbation will remain a stable precession. Yet, if the rotation is about an intermediary axis (like the width of the mobile), a perturbation will be amplified and the object will flip the axis while rotating. The cause is that the moments of inertia (that is, how the mass is distributed about the axis of rotation) about the three axes are unequal, with the one about the intermediary axis in the middle. The math is not immediate, but it can be shown that the character of the perturbation is given by the differences between these moments of inertia. For each axis, the difference involved is between the moments about the other two, such that the difference will be positive when the rotation is about the intermediary axis, and negative otherwise, which changes the physics of the equations describing the perturbations: exponential growth about the intermediary axis vs. harmonic precessions about the other two. You can try to observe the phenomenon for yourself by tossing your mobile rotating in the air above a safe surface: note how the rotation is smooth when about the long and thin sides, but wobbly when about the intermediary side.      <br>The object in the video clip also has three axes of symmetry, and note that the astronaut spins it about the intermediary axis. The object would spin smoothly if the astronaut managed to put it in motion exactly around the respective axis of symmetry, but he didn&#39;t, so the rotation is perturbed from start. The perturbation is amplified until the axis of rotation is flipped. After the flip, since the rotation is still perturbed due to inertia, the axis is again flipped. Because the experiment is in conditions of levitation, the motion looks like an oscillation of the spin.  Otherwise, if done in normal conditions, the flip would be harder to observed because the object would fall to the ground.", "comment_date": "2019-09-22T18:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lyubomir Ikonomov", "comment_text": "Earth cant flip cause its flat.<br>Silly astronauts.", "comment_date": "2019-09-22T18:44:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mehul Ahal", "comment_text": "LastPass : I can store all your passwords and auto-fill them on all platforms, but I&#39;m paid<br>Google Chrome : [can do this for free ] Am I joke to you?", "comment_date": "2019-09-22T18:39:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramon Carlos", "comment_text": "Thou shalt not challenge the venerable Jedi Master Richard Feynman!... oh well... so our understanding of intermediate axis is delayed by being so deep in this gravity well.

The vast amounts of liquid water here certainly makes since and could account for the rarity of life on other planets which should flip too often to allow for life. But exactly how this works is incoherent in your description. <br>Those bottles are filled with liquid while the earth only has a thin surface layer. I assume the liquid inside the bottle tends to remain still and resist the rotation until friction forces at the outer edge balance out. That&#39;s why the bottles quickly slow the rate of rotation, when spun up quickly. Put the bottle on a motor and let it spin until the liquid inside is spinning at same rate, then release it and I expect a VERY different effect. However, all these aspects are completely incomparable to earth, where the surface liquids are all spinning in harmony with earth and there is no boundary friction at all? <br>I learned from somewhere as a child that the function of ocean waves and wind is to stabilize the rotation of the earth.

The axis with greatest inertia can have any energy level.  And so can the other axes.

However, this logic implies that the same effect would occur when the mass rotates about its axis with the smallest moment of inertia. Some important details are missing - namely, the Coriolis force. When you are in a rotating frame you must account for both the Centrifugal force (proportional to mass and the distance from the axis of rotation) as well as the Coriolis force (which increases with mass and velocity, and acts in a direction perpendicular to both the velocity and axis of rotation). Basically, when you rotate about the intermediate axis, the Coriolis forces are negligible because they are proportional to the small masses, and pushing the small masses in a direction perpendicular to their motion and the axis of rotation requires the large masses to move as well, while the Centrifugal force only requires the small masses to move. Therefore the Centrifugal force dominates and you get the effect explained above. Now, when you rotate about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia, a small perturbation of the large masses (which are now along the axis of rotation) results in a Centrifugal force as well as a  Coriolis force, just like before. However, this time the both the Coriolis force and the Centrifugal force are proportional to the large mass, and it is no problem that the Coriolis force requires the small masses to move as well, because they are negligible compared to the big mass. The effect is that the Coriolis force is large enough to move the masses in a direction perpendicular to their motion and the axis of rotation. A force that stays perpendicular to the direction of motion results in circular motion.

Figure one thing out, apply it to another thing you know very little about, assume you know it all and get it wrong.  Great video until the last conclusion.<br><br>So, is the planet at risk of having its moment of inertia changed? <br><br>The first thought is movement of ice. Ice is less dense than water, but does not move like water to the fastest spinning part of the planet like water. Water is inherently stabilizing to the spin. It would have to move to the poles or spin axis to cause a flip, or massively build ice where water is not, drawing water away from the equator.<br><br>Here you have to consider fringe science phenomenon. First, we are in a Grand Solar Minimum. More ice formation is happening. If it goes for 60 to 120 years as expected, then we are talking a cumulative ice build up at the poles, eventually dropping the oceans some 400 feet. This &quot;fringe&quot; cycle has happened every 12K years or so... and we&#39;re over-due. So, it has happened, and could happen. But is this the only effect? No.<br>2nd Fringe science fact. The plasma reactions inside the Earth that generate the magnetic poles are shifting. They do this often enough coincident with collapsing magnetic fields and increased volcanic activity and increased cosmic rays, increased albido effect... essentially amplifying the ice age activity. The second fringe effect is the frozen poles tracks with the magnetic pole movement. Presently sending more ice to Ukraine and ultimately Indonesia. This defineitely sets an imbalance of mass distribution, but not at the current poles. Alaska is showing warming like nobody&#39;s business, it used to be tropical... during the ice age. History repeats itself. So the imbalance and flip might not be fully 180 degrees into a stable position. But something inbetween... like 90 degrees... similar to charted pole flips of the past.<br>And then there is one more fringe effect, crustal slip. WIth the collapse of the magnetic field, you get an increase of cosmic rays. This increases the formation of magma, setting parts of the crust in motion along with the increase in volcanic activity... this enables a movement of mass to the equator that would displace the oceans, Something that has been recorded in virtually every ancient civilization. The effect causes the planet to stop spinning for a day, and completely wiping the surface of most of the plant with a tsunami that clears entire continents. From the records, it seems this extinction level event will spare about 5K people total (there are 2 genetic bottle necks of this level in our DNA records), And the orientation of building structures planet wide confirm the 90 degree shifts... altering the direction the sun rises and sets on the surface. The mechanism explained in this video validates those records with a process that explains why it would shift back and forth in the same 90 degree shift, over and over.<br>Obviously, if we are to change this, we need to artificially create a magnetic field that shields us from cosmic rays. It would help if science stopped kissing up to industry and economic slavery and got real with how the magnetic field of the Earth is made. Paul Pantone&#39;s GEET reactor is the best lead we have right now, and if we don&#39;t pull together, the rest of it won&#39;t matter. Our profit optimized energy grids will likely destroy all life on the planet in this next cycle of extinction events if we don&#39;t get busy mastering the secrets of life and bring forward Tesla&#39;s Aether science. Protecting the wealth of the top industrialists and government world leaders won&#39;t be worth a damn to them if the planet does its thing unchecked. Crawling into a hole while the planet does a makeover that sets millions of tons of radioactive waste all over the place for 100,000 years won&#39;t be something that anyone will come through in generations to come.

Even though the entire T flips, the wings still spin CCW to our perspective. That means the entire T is flipping on the axis that runs between the wings (which doesn&#39;t change the axis where the wings are spinning from) . But what is making the stem of the T flip like that? It only flips after a certain amount of turns, meaning it has to be a progressive force that keeps building in magnitude until it shifts the balance of the stem around. It&#39;s a weak amount of force or torque who&#39;s effect is smaller than the primary spinning axis, because it flips less than the T spins. Because it does not inhibit the spinning, and it always shifts back and forth consistently without destabilizing, it has to be a balanced and constant force that doesn&#39;t loose energy.<br><br>In other words. This flipping is stable and continuous so it must be a natural result of the object spinning, think as though it&#39;s shifting its position like it&#39;s taking the least possible &#39;path&#39; of resistance.

Would the Dzhanibekov effect not happen if that slight off-axis bump were avoided by precise force application?

The thing is, nothing tells us that there is absolute stability on the other two axes, and they never flip over on those axes. Against my own thinking, if the object seeks stability by rotating about an axis where it has maximum moment of inertia, nothing says that the object sought stability about one axis where the masses around it are equally distributed, so the moment of each segment of mass keeps changing while constantly seeking their own axis. The dominant one pulls the largest which results in oval shape locus. Just like the earth going round the sun, its oval. Its the principle of conservation of energy that can be used to satisfy Kepler&#39;s law. The earth is for sure not balanced, or at least no one can be sure of that. As for the wing nut, it calls for a lab experiment to create a perfectly balanced wing nut, spun around a ball bearing and see its behaviour.

If we were to do the same experiment on earth, but to move along the same accelerating reference frame as the object which is spinning about its intermediate principle axis, would we see the same result? <br>A second guess would be the lack of air currents which could cause additional perturbations that lead to the chaotic motion we see on the earth experiment. On earth, as the object is flipped, air is rushing past it since it is falling or rising in air. <br>A third guess would be that the way that the torque is applied about the intermediate axis for the objects in the space station is guided by the screw itself. So if I attempt to flip my phone about its intermediate axis, I may be easily introducing additional perturbations along other principle axes. The fact that the objects spin in the space station is initiated by spinning the object around a guided axis of rotation (such as spinning a wing nut about a threaded rod) provide torque that is more precisely aligned with the principle axis. <br>Thus: If the third hypothesis is true, nothing should be stopping you from seeing this strikingly fast spin flip in an experiment which can be conducted here on earth. If you had a slow-mo camera, you could get a wing nut and place it on a horizontal lubricated screw. Then you could spin the wing-nut off the screw and let the wing-nut fall to the ground. If you go high enough, perhaps you can see the effect in slow-mo.

However, I would argue for an easier, and much older, explanation to the Dzhanibekov effect based on the Binet ellipsoid. It Turns out that in the body frame, the rotating frame of reference that exhibits the centrifugal forces, angular momentum can be used to form the surface of a sphere and the kinetic energy can be used to form the surface of an ellipsoid (A 3D Ellipse). Since in the torque free motion of a rigid body requires that both angular moment and kinetic energy must be conserved, then path of the motion, technically the angular momentum vector in the body frame, must lie on the intersection of the ellipsoid and the sphere (See GIF). It can be seen that the intersections form closed ring motions (i.e. stable rotations) around the axis with the smallest and largest moments of inertia. However, around the intermediate axis the intersections do not form closed circles, they cross all the way around the ellipse indicating that the motion is unstable and flips back and forth periodically. So the reason that the instability arises is because these two &quot;competing&quot; quantities (Angular momentum and Kinetic energy) must both be conserved at the same time. <br><br>Here is a GIF and Video to show visualizations.<br><br>GIF: <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Intersecting_ellipsoids.gif\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Intersecting_ellipsoids.gif</a><br>Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei79Y_aqrm0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei79Y_aqrm0</a><br><br>edit: I love your videos by the way.", "comment_date": "2019-09-19T20:59:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akif Qadeer", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s explain something that cannot be explained simply.

There are usually more variables at force than may initially appear. Spinning increases stability it seems and all atoms etc are spinning too. Why have the poles flipped many times before and would that not be a slight problem for magnetic media. I think science showed that the poles flipped slowly though. If it were fast, then maybe back to the drawing board. When you throw a dart it follows the centre weight and will always wobble all over the place on its journey to the board when you look side on in slow motion which is why you should throw it from that point in the first place so it goes where you want. If you throw it backwards it will spin around the right way before reaching the board. The wonder of flights. The Earth isn&#39;t actually round or a sphere though is it. But is also encompasses the atmosphere above to the edge of space (hence the burning up friction on entry) so it isn&#39;t merely a non-round thing spinning like a ball with a molten core spinning at a slower rate. Things moving creates stability or more stability just like a bike will stay upright if moving forward even with nobody on it.

I haven&#39;t done the calculation, but it&#39;s obvious that the oblate shape of the [quasi-] solid Earth involves a far greater amount of mass than the mass of water shifting from the ocean surface toward the poles.  I can&#39;t remember the quantities exactly, but I believe the oblaticity of the Earth is on the order of 10 miles, which, depending on which layers are involved (or likely <i>all</i> of them!), would involve much more mass than the ice caps (also considering the difference in density between rock and ice)<br>    I think the change in moment of inertia would be sufficient, however, to produce a measurable change in the length of a day, with the Earth speeding up in its rotation during glacial Maxima, and slowing down during glacial Minima.  my guess is that it would be pretty small, but I&#39;m sure this calculation has already been done.

That Mars spins in roughly the same direction as the Earth-despite it&#39;s uneven distribution of mass strongly suggests we don&#39;t have to worry about the Earth flipping around. And with the exceptions of Venus and Uranus, and tidaly locked bodies (or resonant ones like Mercury) most other planets spin similarly to the Earth, and Mars, easily modeled by a right-hand-rule (mine) where if thumbs up is North, then the forefinger points in the direction of orbit and the fingers wrap in the direction of rotation; this suggests that the Mars correction was not like your freely rotating body (with the cubes) but affected enough by orbital mechanics to instead move the dense spot to the position of least energy, and not flip the entire planet. <br><br> Other related aspects to this. Gyroscopic precession (Which Walter Lewin of MIT says &quot;Is the most counter-intuitive concept in all of physics...including quantum mechanics&quot;.)  And did you forget to say that in a perfect rotation with no off-axis wobble then the flip won&#39;t happen? <br><br>Also a spinning top will often go through stages of increasing and decreasing wobble as it slows down.  So a spinning top not touching a surface would instead of wobbling and correcting, flip? <br><br>What I also like is how your goal is to find an intuitive explanation. This is what Feynman was really good at. Einstein I would argue did the same thing as well. If you can understand something intuitively than two things are possible. First, you might be able to use it in normal life and second, it makes the more complicated scientific and mathematics understanding more accessible to those working at the highest levels. Einstein didn&#39;t start with complicated mathematics and worked backwards, he first visualized. Imagine anyone prior to Newton even knowing where to begin thinking about gravity in more than a practical sense.  With gyroscopic precession I think what I observed in a judo demonstration in a Japanese high school was a practical application of gyroscopic precession (without understanding the concept).  A student spun his arms which turned his body to his left allowing him to plant his right foot and keep his balance.

He is also well known for his Tafsir, which is widely considered authoritative. He was born in Mijdal, a village on the outskirts of the city of Busra, to the east of Damascus, in the year 701 A.H. and was taught by Ibn Taymiyya, Al-Mizzi, Ibn Qayyim, Al-Dhahabi, Ibn Al Firkah, Isa bin Al-Mutim, Ahmed bin Abi-Talib, Ibn Al-Hajjar, Baha Ad-Din Al-Qasim bin Muzaffar bin Asakir, Ibn Ash-Shirazi, Ishaq bin Yahya Al-Ammuddi, Zahriyyah Shaykh, and Muhammad bin Zarrad. Upon completion of his studies he obtained his first official appointment in 1341, when he joined an inquisitorial commission formed to determine certain questions of heresy. Thereafter he received various semi-official appointments, culminating in June/July 1366 with a professorial position at the Great Mosque of Damascus. Ibn Kathir wrote a famous commentary on the Qur&#39;an named Tafsir al-Qur&#39;an al-&#39;Adhim which linked certain Hadith, or sayings of Muhammad, and sayings of the sahaba to verses of the Qur&#39;an, in explanation.
