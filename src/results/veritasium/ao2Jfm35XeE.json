Much of this has been confirmed by observing volcanic rocks forming and then examining them, as well as by working with rock samples or molten material in the laboratory to artificially reproduce rocks that are found in Nature.<br><br>Rock-forming minerals and other minerals never grow in an undisturbed environment, so none of them ever grow absolutely &quot;perfectly.&quot; The closest that naturally forming minerals might approach this is when individual crystals or loose crystal structures grow in some sort of cavity within some rock structure and produce samples that are very highly valued by mineral collectors who might pay hundreds or many thousands of dollars for a unique sample. Snowflakes, on the other hand, beautiful though they might be, are very difficult to collect, let alone preserve, display and admire for very long.<br><br>By the way, ice/snow/water is a mineral \u2013 the most common mineral on the surface of Earth.", "comment_date": "2022-03-29T07:34:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Torres \ud83d\udd4e\u271d\ufe0f", "comment_text": "<i>As He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, \u201cTell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?\u201d Jesus answered them, </i><b><i>\u201cTake heed that no one deceives you.

Jesus spoke of heaven and hell as real places (Matthew 13:41\u201342; 23:33; Mark 9:43\u201347; Luke 12:5). The story Jesus told about the rich man and Lazarus was an actual event that demonstrated the reality of the two eternal destinations (Luke 16:19\u201331). Heaven is the dwelling place of God (2 Chronicles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao2Jfm35XeE&amp;t=30m27s\">30:27</a>) where Jesus has gone to \u201cprepare a place\u201d for those who love Him (John 14:2). Hell was created for \u201cthe devil and his angels\u201d (Matthew 25:41). But because every human being is a sinner, every person past the age of accountability has already been condemned to hell (Romans 3:10; 5:12; John 3:18). We all deserve hell as the just punishment for our rebellion against God (Romans 6:23).<br><br>Jesus was clear that \u201cno one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again\u201d (John 3:3). He was also clear that hell is an eternal punishment for those who do not obey Him (Matthew 25:46). Second Thessalonians 1:8\u20139 says that in the end God \u201cwill punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.\u201d John the Baptist said about Jesus, \u201cHis winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire\u201d (Matthew 3:12).", "comment_date": "2022-01-29T10:00:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "clownage123", "comment_text": "What a snowflake!", "comment_date": "2022-01-29T03:29:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gigachad", "comment_text": "Hes so happy doing this stuff, it really makes me smile.", "comment_date": "2022-01-29T02:32:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ihor Zaitsev", "comment_text": "Father God loves You so Much \u2764", "comment_date": "2022-01-28T17:13:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Zdenek Moravcik, inventor of AGI", "comment_text": "I like what he said at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao2Jfm35XeE&amp;t=12m20s\">12:20</a> &quot;no two things are alike&quot;.<br>I explain this in my videos about functioning of Universe.

He gave up His glory and His throne to suffer and die for us, because we\u2019ve all sinned against a holy and perfectly just God, but He gave His only son Jesus for you. Because we\u2019re all heading to hell, because we\u2019ve sinned (lied, stolen, using God\u2019s name as a cussword, dishonoring your parents, making up your own god, adultery etc. Like c\u2019mon you can\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t lied atleast once in your life). But<br>John 3:16: for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, so that everyone that believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Yeah you heard that right! God wants to give you everlasting life with Him, but that\u2019s not possible when you\u2019re still living in sin and because of that you\u2019ll spend eternity in hell. That\u2019s why Jesus came! So now all you have to do is repent wholeheartedly of your sins and trust in Jesus! He will give you a new heart with new desires and you will be made new and holy. But we\u2019ll never be perfect on this earth, because we\u2019re still in our earthly body. But we\u2019ll be deattached to our flesh and we\u2019ll have our focus on Jesus and God\u2019s kingdom that\u2019s coming! It\u2019s coming very soon btw so please repent (confess and forsake) of your sins and trust in Jesus that He may change you and make you new and give you everlasting life in Heaven without disease, lain, suffering etc. Instead of hell and hellfire.<br>So repent and trust in Jesus!!

I think too much importance may have been given to Temperature, and not to Humidity. Having lived in a place where the winters get to -40C, and they are very dry, I kind of noticed that you get different kinds of snowflakes depending on both factors - which in this place are actually somehow connected, that is, the colder it is, the dryer the air is. I&#39;m not sure exactly of how it might work, but I remember seeing the most beautiful intricate snowflakes at very low temperatures, below -20C, when it is also quite dry.

Will the flat plate snowflake get a 3D shape by adding H2O molecules in the basal facets?", "comment_date": "2021-12-08T17:24:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "K.

This snowflake formation could be very well explained by classical physics. In fact, water is often simulated using classical models; quantum models are just too computationally demanding. I don&#39;t think we can simulate enough water, long enough to unravel its secreted quantum mechanically, but classical mechanics brings us tantalisingly close. Yet, we can&#39;t seem to be able to lower a water simulation temperature until low density ice is spontaneously formed. It should be feasible, but so far it seems impossible to freeze water from the condensed phase, not the supersaturated phase. The greatest secrete water holds is how it turns into ice in a simulation.  We do not need to go at the electron level too understand water, just how it bounces around at the molecular level should be enough, but it isn&#39;t.

That&#39;s why so many minerals exibit different crystal morphology and/or habitus, despite having the same chemical composition, i.e. the same chemical formula (think of diamond and graphite, for example). These are known as polymorphs. The nucleation barrier arise from Gibbs free energy of nucleation, which has to have a negative change in order for nucleation to happen spontaneously, and that is obviously tied to pressure and temperature of the system, but also to the presence of small impurities (particles) in the otherwise homogeneous solution, which serve as a starting point for nucleation to happen. After the formation of a nucleus, crystal growth is controled by the geometry of chemical bonds, which in turn control the growth of crystal faces. Crystal faces with more &quot;broken chemical bonds&quot; (i.e. crystal faces with larger surface energy) grow quicker, as those are the faces molecules from the solution will preferably choose to bond with in order to minimize the surface energy. Exposed crystal surfaces on a crystal therefore have the lowest surface energies, as those surfaces with higher energies have been &quot;overgrown&quot; so to speak. That is the path for a crystal to reach its thermodynamical equlibrium (which is usually not true equlibrium but the kinetics of crystal growth are usually so slow those crystal can exist in a metastable phase for a long periods of time). That&#39;s why the morphology of a crystal can tell us a lot about the conditions at which a crystal has formed, and even those minerals that are otherwise unstable at the surface of the Earth can still persist, even though they formed at a vastly different conditions, such as those in the Earth&#39;s lower crust or mantle.", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T18:43:19Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "acexxxoasis", "comment_text": "This is amazing", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T18:41:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Gibson", "comment_text": "How about an intro to explain what in the F*CK is going on?

The reality is that during any measurable snow event within a particular geographical region the snowflakes involved certainly take a different path to the ground but to conclude that within those varying paths there are enough atmospheric differences to account for the difference in shape of every snowflake is the result of dishonest and/or bad science. You can certainly create unique  conditions for a particular snowflake in a laboratory setting by turning some knobs or pressing some buttons, as was demonstrated in this video, but in the natural world hundreds of thousands of unformed snowflakes, some only millimeters apart, each falling out of the atmosphere at the same velocity, in the same geographical vicinity, are certainly not passing through the hundreds of thousands of different atmospheric conditions before they reach the ground.  You would need a an  innumerable number of atmospheric differences just to account for every snowflake in even the smallest of snow events.  Impossible. Therefore, the explanation you have put forth in this video should be completely rejected and a more realistic explanation for this phenomenon should be explored.<br><br>There is a big reason why Dr. Libbrecht and so many other &quot;experts&quot; are unable to provide a plausible explanation for this phenomenon.  Dr. Libbrecht has started with a faulty assumption.  Dr. Libbrecht stated that snowflake shapes... &quot;appear spontaneously&quot;  and that &quot;There is no blueprint for what&#39;s going on.&quot;  Since this assumption is incorrect, the conclusion is incorrect. Dr. Libbrecht has rejected the correct assumption and therefore must resort to presenting a mere guess as a fact in an effort to appear like he knows the answer.  A faulty assumption leads to a faulty conclusion. Allow me to share the true explanation for the amazing phenomenon of snowflake shape differences. It&#39;s quite simple really. God, who is the infinite Creator of the universe is the explanation. We will never be able to explain the cause of snowflake shape differences using finite human wisdom alone.  The fact that no two snowflakes are ever alike only reinforces what God told us thousands of years ago about how He has revealed His existence to us through the many amazing wonders of the universe.  Read Isaiah 40:26, Psalms 19:1, Romans 1:20 if you doubt this to be true.  Mr. Bently, who by the way, was mostly homeschooled and a firm believer in a God created universe, knew this about God and was able to show the world one of these many wonders in1885 using nothing more than a snowflake under a microscope, which he referred to as a &quot;...a masterpiece of design.&quot;  It&#39;s a beautiful thing when a scientist trying to make discoveries about the wonders of the natural world starts with the correct assumptions. <br><br>Scientists like Dr. Libbrecht, need to take a page or two out of Mr. Bently&#39;s book when it comes to science and the assumptions necessary for reaching the right conclusions about the natural world. Better yet, picking up a Bible and reading it would be even better.  More scientists need to read the Bible today. Not only would their science be better but more importantly they would find out how much they and everyone else in the world needs Jesus Christ.", "comment_date": "2021-12-04T09:59:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chandan Gupta cpg", "comment_text": "108, hexagonal shape is it all natures math syllables \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2021-12-04T09:52:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "johan gielis", "comment_text": "Wonderful video.", "comment_date": "2021-12-04T09:52:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Clinton", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao2Jfm35XeE&amp;t=17m04s\">17:04</a> San Andreas, Why do you care about San Andreas?

I really love your channel, thanks for another great video! Just wanted to ask, or maybe point out that in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao2Jfm35XeE&amp;t=8m23s\">8:23</a> you said that &quot;when the basal facets grow faster you get a column&quot; and then &quot;if the prism facets grow faster, you get a flat snowflake&quot;, isn&#39;t it the opposite? When the basal facets grow faster the solid grows &quot;horizontally&quot; and when the prism facets grow faster the solid grows &quot;vertically&quot;, right? I assume that a facet grows when it&#39;s surface grows, however when you add a layer of molecules (of it&#39;s same shape and surface) atop (or to the side of) a facet you don&#39;t change it&#39;s surface, you change the number of layers of the same kind by 1 (for example: if you add layers to the top of a prism as in the video it&#39;s prism facets, wich are related to it&#39;s &quot;height&quot;, grow). Something similar is said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao2Jfm35XeE&amp;t=15m27s\">15:27</a> &quot;so that surface grows only slowly&quot; while if adding layers to the sides is &quot;easier&quot; than adding to the top or bottom, the basal facets (top and bottom) grow faster (because it&#39;s easier for their surfaces to grow, since that&#39;s what happens when you add layers to the sides).

The device we plug in has resistors or fuses that decrease voltage. Obviously radio waves carry way less voltage. This means for radio to replace electricity you would need to receive the radio wave and then amplify the inbound voltage. Maybe using something like a car battery for the initial amplifier energy. Amplifiers exist so is using radio waves to power devices possible. Like if we have the 60 Hertz radiowave beaming from a WiFi router ? Receive the radio wave with a micro filament wire and then amp it by moving it to a bigger wire ? Apparently amplifying frequency is possible so why not have this as an alternative to electricity which is just a higher frequency which we resist using resistor fuses at device plugs. What is the actual frequency a device needs therefore to be powered after we filter the high voltage frequency with plug resistors ? Can you even ask anyone or are you relying on fake science information from electricity companies that are worried you will figure out that people are paying for essentially wired radio going into plugs.

I had the same drive to understand how naval armor worked so that I could put REAL results into miniature naval wargames that I played while in college and after.  I had no idea what a hole I was stepping into since it turned out that NOBODY had worked this out EVER (even when battleships were the main protection of the nations using them; no joke) for the main heavy armor type used in battleship[s from the early 1890s until they were considered obsolete as the most important warships from about the middle pf WWII (aircraft carriers and submarines took over rather rapidly).  So, while I had a lot of information about the softer kinds of armor used in such things as decks and turret roof and in thin armor of smaller warships, the thick face-hardened (&quot;Krupp Cemented&quot; face-hardened nickel-chromium steel armor introduced in 1894 and quickly taking over the side armor of battleships during the rest of the 1890s and thereafter) was usually just handled by &quot;fudge factors&quot; grafted onto the somewhat accurate formulae for the softer armors.(by the end pf WWII the US Navy had developed extremely good and reasonably accurate formulae and data sets for softer armor types, for example).  So I discovered that I had to create my own formulae and data sets to handle the rather different properties of face-hardened naval armor that could be over two feet thick (turret frontal armor on the Japanese super-battleships of the YAMATO Class in WWII) (!!!).  I was very systematic and tried to separate out each different property of the KC armor, several of which simply did not exist in the soft armor, such as how thick and hard the face of the armor was.<br><br>I spent over 50 years on this study and was amazingly lucky in getting sources of information (my luck was beyond belief, as I see it).  I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.  In the process, I discovered various rules that changed things from those prior &quot;rules-of-thumb&quot; used to fudge the soft armor information to get something that &quot;kin-of&quot; worked -- &quot;Good enough for Government work&quot; literally applied to warship design plans.  For example, I discovered by chance -- by matching test result plots to my created formulae that could calculate those plots -- that scaling (how armor resistance changed just by making the size of the projectiles and plates bigger or smaller with nothing else changed) varied directly with face-thickness percentage when the effects and numbers in the formulae representing these thickness percentages were graphed on a LOG-LOG graph paper scale.  In fact, I was not the one who noticed this but a mathematician friend who was reviewing my various results.  To get a straight line on LOG-LOG paper plotting systems is highly unusual, but my formulae did it by simply matching the test results to the formulae I had created.

It is estimated that a single cubic meter of snow holds about 350 million snowflakes! These flakes are all hexagonal and have crystal-like structures. However, each one of them possesses a unique shape. For years, scientists have been searching for answers to such questions as how these shapes ever came about, how it is that each one of them has a different shape and what provides their symmetry. Every bit of information that is gained reveals another magnificent mastery present in the snowflakes. The variety and perfection of the hexagonal structure of snowflakes is a manifestation of Allah&#39;s status as the Originator (al-Badi). Allah is the One Who made good everything that He has created. The formation of snowflakes constitutes yet another aspect of Allah&#39;s endless artistry.<br><br>These thin, small flakes look like multi-pointed stars or tiny needle heads. The formation of the snowflakes in the pictures is truly amazing. For years, the orderly structure of snowflakes has caught people&#39;s attention. Since 1945, research has been carried out in a quest to discover which factors give the final shape to the crystals. A single snowflake is a pile of crystals consisting of more than 200 ice crystals. Snowflakes are made up of water molecules that are shaped in a perfect order. Snowflakes, one of nature&#39;s true architectural wonders, are shaped when water vapor gets cold while passing through clouds. This takes place like so:<br><br>Passing through the clouds, water molecules scattered everywhere in a disorganized way throughout water vapor begin to lose their random movement due to the fall in temperature. After a while, the water molecules, moving more slowly, begin to form groups and consequently become solid. Yet, there is no disorder whatsoever in their groupings. On the contrary, they always unite as microscopic hexagonal forms that look similar to each other. Each snowflake at first consists of a single hexagonal water molecule, then other hexagonal water molecules come and attach to this first piece. According to experts on the subject, the basic factor that determines the shape of a snowflake is that these hexagonal water molecules are joined together just like links in a chain. In addition, the pieces of crystals, which normally should look alike, take on very different shapes according to the temperature and level of moisture.(1)<br><br>Why is it that there is a hexagonal symmetry in all snowflakes and why is each of them different from the others? Why are their edges angled rather then straight? Scientists are still trying to find answers to these questions. Yet, this much is evident: Allah is the One Who has no partners in creation, is the Possessor of an endless power and the Originator of everything.<br><br><i>_____________________________________</i><br><br>1- Roger Davey, David Stanley, &quot;All about ice,&quot; New Scientist, September 6, 1993.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T13:00:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andrew", "comment_text": "Could what we have learned about snowflakes growing basal facet columns be used in manufacturing carbon nano tubes in bulk?", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T13:00:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Ramgren", "comment_text": "did anyone else not really want to watch this video but you did anyway and got blown away???", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T13:00:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Carlo Tony Daristotile", "comment_text": "Could be useful in understanding how DNA and RNA and Proteins form....etc...", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T13:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Li Jimmy", "comment_text": "history of white people \ud83d\ude42", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T13:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vikram Singh", "comment_text": "Not surprising there was no mention of Johannes Kepler.

That phenomena point to electro-magnetic (E.M.) informations (almost no energy needed) and E.M. energy which are at the origin of all this.<br>Indeed it start its existence  from the hexagonal pattern at the matter molecular level of ice lattice but all the add up we see on a flake when it grows are influenced by electro-magnetic &quot; fields &quot;emanations from this hexagonal pattern in the first place.<br><br>In fact I like the  experimented fact  that a potential difference or a magnetic field difference  (we need  two bunches of matter, that is the only way to  build that up that in Space) in vacuum Space cause the Space to CONTRACT. (EINSTEIN got it in the special case of a &quot; matter emitted gravity field &quot; effect on Space .  Space only react to and/or transmit E.M.&quot;fields&quot; effects, nothing else so gravity must be a result of matter E.M. outside effect only understandable if  FLUXES are taken in consideration (earth is gigantic and the &quot;&quot; E field emitted by a 10.000 square km matter surface remain a constant up to about 20.000 km above that plane)))<br><br>Classical  electro-magnetism still used partially today in all models (classical, quantums models)  take for granted ( 300 years ago grandpa physicists observations) that one charge Q plus and one charge Q minus &quot;attract&quot; each other. That is acceptable provided you find &quot;material&quot; charges to experiment with.  Q is a calculated concept, we need consequently a technology called a capacity where &quot;charges&quot; are separated from neutrality (battery as an example) and transferred in equal and opposite values to each plate to prove that attraction..<br> Nuclear physicists observe every day that two,( hanged in a collider vacuum tunnel )metal plates, with (as an example) a potential on one plate at plus 1000 volts and a potential on the opposing one at minus 1000 volts (potential difference 2000 volts applied) attract each other. <br>But, when they apply plus 1000 Volts on each plate (same calculated Q plus) they  never saw a repulsion. Well note that the corresponding Q minus was given to the earth grounding and that between  the two 100 volts potential opposing plates there is no potential difference (both at 1000 volts plus). <br>WHAT? Static electricity (charges Q)  work only in attraction when  sign are opposite. So what is the origin of the repulsions we see everywhere in nature. (magnets (rotating E field of a dip\u00f4le), protons plasma (charge q plus) taking all the available Space.(ITER) and so on) See KELVIN works and equations on particles  vorticity and Energy transmission to matter (ONLY) in the form of heat. Heat form of energy transmit itself only in matter never ever in vacuum Space. Vacuum Space can only interact (including the &quot;particles localization&quot; processes) with E.M. energy (principally the rotating E field or H field  to name it)<br>So  the above experiments on ice flakes formation made  in vacuum should confirm the E.M causality", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T11:50:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Adam Brown", "comment_text": "Really amazing production.
