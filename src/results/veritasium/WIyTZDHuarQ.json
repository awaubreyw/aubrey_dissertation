Therefore I cut the bad organ, and, as for killing you, there is a method with viruses by abandoned poison more. If the organ is an irreplaceable thing, I am going to deceive it by organ transplantation. However, a soul dwells in an organ. Organ transplantation is to disturb the harmony of the soul and is to betray a fate. Seeing from the point, the Oriental medicine elucidates a cause of illness, and the cure is established, too. The cause of illness is curses such as departed souls. It is the creature which the vindictive spirits such as animals killed by eating meat dwell in cancer in cellulosity, and is going to possess and kill a human being. Therefore it recurs again no matter how much I cut it. Because I exterminate dirty blood (the meat which I ate becomes the blood) becoming the cell of cancer by not taking in macrobiotekku is animal protein, and the book of cancer disappears, cancer becomes extinct. A lymphocyte of the immune system preys on a cancer and is cured by natural healing power. I bear a grudge, and the cancer toxin stops by and occurs. A cancer-causing agent is poison, and poison reduces natural healing power. It is necessary to raise weather of splenic (when I say in Western medicine stomach) to overcome a cancer (a ginseng is effective for this). In other words, it is to bring back natural healing power. It is necessary to fix the balance of the Yin and Yang of the heart. I reinforce a weak thing, and physical spirit increase by controlling a strong thing, and it can be the mind and body which can cope with what kind of disease. Therefore important thing is to eat farm products harvested by the natural agricultural methods that are not soaked in a pesticide, a chemical fertilizer with an intake of the poison near at hand.\r<br>\r<br>\u203bThe Shinto art book that Prince Shotoku edited the Oriental medicine, predecessors in the family line past event biography of an emperor completion is the thing which is based to pass. I understand the art and need Huang Ti wisdom to pass, and to be familiar with a bare question. I accept Western lie science, and the fool who is handled as a superstition in Shinto cannot understand Sino-Japanese traditional medicine. The disease is actually caused by the spiritual power of the demon. The Oriental medicine gets over by sending this malarial air outside a body by natural healing power.\r<br>\r<br>The corona is a mere cold. You should use the Chinese medicine of syoukannron, but a drug to use is different in progress condition of illness. I let taiyoutyuhuusyou (fever, sweat appearance, a backwind, a pulse loosen and relax) perspire by a symptom in keisitou when illness remains in taiyouboukoukei of the table and get over. I cure taiyousyoukannsyou, influenza (fever, adiaphoresis, chills, a pulse loosen and are tense) in maoutou. Therefore you must change the medicine by a symptom. If malarial air moves to syouyoukei, I use the settlement method of syousaikotou. The symptom feels uncomfortable at chills or fever traffic, underarm and a pulse is sunk and is like the string. In youmeikei, I give a flight next time in syouzyoukitou. taiinkei uses rityutou to raise the weather of the spleen. I use busitou letting you activate the weather of the kidney in syouinkei next time. When the weather of this kidney runs out, I die. Finally, when weather declines in ketuinkei, gloom disappears and dies. The toukisigyakutouw Chinese medicine which makes blood, and adds to the weather of the kidney is difficult. The weather of the spleen causes inflammation the fight with malarial air in youmeikei and uses a drug to give it to when a flight hardened by stomach heat. Natural healing power falls to the person who is not stomach heat if I cool stomach, and the illness gets to the deep part of the body. This is the malpractice that an incompetent doctor commits. As for the carrot, busi is medicine letting you activate the weather of the kidney the weather of the spleen. The person having a low resistance runs a fever immediately. This is because an organ weakens and becomes the immediate venereal disease of the high heat. Because illness remains in youmeiikei then, I judge illness on the stool and an attendant by a laxative. At that time, it is the drug of Daikan characteristics such as gypsum, the Rhubarb that I am used. The Chinese medicine changes a prescription by the place where malarial air invaded for the same disease. I use a prescription to raise weather of the every part of one&#39;s body at the time of chronic disease. For example, I use ninnzinntou because diabetes is the disease that the weather (sugar is left in the urine) of the spleen weakened. I combine byakko in the Chinese medicine, but it is an error. Because the chronic nephritis is the disease that the weather (protein is left in the urine) of the kidney weakened, I use busitou.\r<br>\r<br>The cause of cancer is caused by eating meat, and leukemia is caused by an intake of the milk. Cancer is cured with natural healing power. The reason why a cancer occurs is that this natural healing power decreases. A cancer-causing agent is a toxin, and this toxin reduces natural healing power. You must take care of health by a meal to raise natural healing power. The meal strikes it for a small appetite on two meals of days. I stop the snack. The ingredients take only the thing made with natural agriculture. I avoid the thing which is soaked in manure, a pesticide. I take the seasonal thing. I eat brown rice. I do not eat the genetically-modified food (potato corn, soybean, grape fruit juice sugar). When I chew it well and digest it with saliva, a burden does not depend on the stomach and intestines.\r<br>\r<br>Final note\r<br>The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority.

Or if we entangle two particles (carefully nudge two spinning particles against each other), obviously the observations we make on those particles at the same time showing their spins are synchronized CAN NOT just be their rotations are synchronized. NO! Of course the mainstream theory is that those two particles are mysteriously linked by unknown forces and that observing two synchronized spinning objects can&#39;t just mean that they&#39;re. just. synchronized. spinning. objects... They don&#39;t mention how if one of those particles are interfered with then they no longer show synchronicity between observations. Too obvious obviously.

In the form of energy, the electron is Potential, a wave at all times, that is until a proton strikes a neutron and creates a magnetic wave to particalize the electron into a bubble around it and depending on how many protons happened to sneak in will make the atom, because the electron network is abundant like the ocean.

They&#39;re just mathematical models based on incomplete (or incompletable) observations.

Nondeterministic ones do not scale unless one claims (equally ridiculously, in my opinion) that the macro and micro worlds experience different &quot;physics&quot;. I&#39;d rather believe that the very act of engaging an electron or photon (to measure it) produces the same. In other words, there is no &quot;there&quot; there until you shove something in the way (like a silicon semiconductor, vapor, magnetic field or wall). Imagine that you have a matrix field of UV laser beams. Since they are UV, you can&#39;t see them. Now imagine that you place something with fluorescence (like a piece of paper or a tiny ball with phosphor on it) in the field. You can suddenly see the field in the form of a dot. Now imagine that this field permeates the entire universe (spacetime) but unlike the UV lasers, it is the thing we call &quot;Phosphor&quot; when we &quot;charge&quot; the field to that level which corresponds to &quot;Phosphor&quot;. The instant we turn on a light or collide &quot;packets&quot; of quanta, the field produces the photons/electrons or said &quot;quanta&quot; respectively. Prior to &quot;charging&quot; the field, there isn&#39;t any measurable thing other than the field itself (represented by the oil in this video). The &quot;Quanta&quot; aren&#39;t things at all (similar to string theory) but they are energized regions of this multi-dimensional field. We don&#39;t know that this &quot;field&quot; is there because it is not visible (with our current tools)...until you charge it. It could be like tiny lines or like soup. I can imagine fields within these fields that likewise, can&#39;t be seen or measured because we simply don&#39;t have the tools to do so. We can see that the universe extends to a similar scale in the &quot;larger&quot; direction. I find it hubris to think that when we scale down, it stops at &quot;Quanta&quot; simply because that is the smallest thing we can detect. On another point, I somewhat understand the notion of gravity being a &quot;force&quot; but it doesn&#39;t need to be. You can imagine that there is no such thing and everything still works (I think this is old news in some sense). We are falling towards the center of the earth which is falling towards the Sun which is falling towards the center of the galaxy etc... Spacetime is bending this &quot;field&quot;.

It is bafflingly illogical. I first learned about the Copenhagen interpretation when I decided to search up Schrodinger&#39;s Cat and learn what that was all about. Schrodinger&#39;s Cat, mind you, does a darn good job of demonstrating the extreme lack of logic in the Copenhagen interpretation - so much so that Einstein sent a letter to Schrodinger in 1950 congratulating him on intellectually dismantling the Copenhagen interpretation. (It was a short letter and it&#39;s interesting to see how even Einstein didn&#39;t fully approve of Copenhagen, so I&#39;ll paste it below.) And yet, for some bizarre reason, the Copenhagen interpretation has not been done away with, and people commit intellectual suicide to pretend it&#39;s a plausible thing. If Copenhagen was correct, that would mean the core of our Earth, at this moment, literally does not exist in a definite state (meaning it&#39;s both stable and also exploding at the same time (or at least beginning to destabilize toward an explosion, because we would not see the immediate effects)). Why? Oh yeah, just because nobody is looking at the core of our planet with their eyeballs. Seriously, adherence to the Copenhagen interpretation is like trying to utilize a liberal arts degree in a laboratory.<br><br>Here&#39;s what Einstein wrote to Schrodinger:<br>&quot;You are the only contemporary physicist, besides Laue, who sees that one cannot get around the assumption of reality, if only one is honest. Most of them simply do not see what sort of risky game they are playing with reality\u2014reality as something independent of what is experimentally established. Their interpretation is, however, refuted most elegantly by your system of radioactive atom + amplifier + charge of gun powder + cat in a box, in which the psi-function of the system contains both the cat alive and blown to bits. Nobody really doubts that the presence or absence of the cat is something independent of the act of observation.&quot;<br><br>(Yes, Schrodinger&#39;s setup used poison instead of gunpowder.

Measuring the distance, velocity, oscillation, rotation of a &quot;thing&quot; requires at least two points of data. More points of data gives us more information (kind of like two photos vs a video). For things in motion, measurement is complicated by the speed and size of the thing being measured. <br><br>Consider a tube of water. If you record the position of a single molecule of water at the starting end of a water hose, then its location at another position, say, the end of the hose, and divide by time, you might conclude its velocity. But you would only know its velocity &quot;from&quot; point A to point B. And you would have to make assumptions about its velocity (and position) at any points in between. <br><br>So what if the water hose started at a valve on the front of a building, but ran underneath the building and you found the other end coming out on the other side of the building? You would not know the length of the hose (distance) from point A to point B. <br><br>if you knew the velocity of the water coming out of the valve was 50 ft per minute, and you placed a blue pellet (neutral bouyancy lets say) in the stream at the valve, and it came out on the other side of the building exactly 1 minute later, you might conclude that the length of the hose jnder the building was 50 ft. Especially if you were able to repeat this experiment multiple times with the same result. Likewise, if the pellet appeared consistently 2 minutes later, then you could conclude that the hose was 100 ft long. <br><br>But what if the pellet appeared on the other end at seemingly random time intervals?  The water is still flowing. The velocity of the water at the entry point and exit point is still 50 ft per min. Nothing has changed. But the pellet appears at random times. What would you conclude?<br><br>What if you repeated this 10 times and the exit times were 1 min, 5 mins, 2.3 min, 3.14 mins, and so on?  What you are missing is the Diameter of the hose under the building. Maybe it changes to a tank, not a hose. And then back to a hose on the other side. So the pellet moves through the hose at a somewhat constant rate. But once it enters the tank, it doesn&#39;t follow a set path of flow. It will eventually make it to the other side and exit the hose for you to see and mark its time. But the times will be seemingly random. <br><br>Even so, if you repeated this experiment thousands of times, and plotted the times, you would eventually observe a pattern. The Range of times would be confined to, say, 1 minute to 10 minutes. But a vast majority of the times would fall within a smaller range. <br><br>Additionally, from the patterns you detect, you could make conclusions about the Size of the tank. The larger the tank, the greater the range of exit times. The lesser the range, the smaller the tank. <br><br>Now place TWO pellets in the stream and measure.

It is the electron&#39;s quantum mechanics that explains, classically, what the photons do, not waves. Huygens had no way to know what was at work at that scale, in the 1600&#39;s. What Huygens did was to observe various kinds of waves at the macro scales and assuming they are the mechanism by which energy works at that scale,to then attribute the same mechanism to the quantum scale. What he also did not know is that in the 1900&#39;s, waves at the macro scale were all analyzed, to find they were all, without exception, artifacts of deeper mechanisms. Water, or more generally fluid waves, consist of horizontal to direction of travel, columns rotating with vertical sheets of fluid released, to form a hump we call a wave.

Take an old spoon (this will ruin it) and put it over a stove burner. After it is hot, use an eyedropper to add water from a fraction of an inch above the spoon. The water forms a ball and floats there! Adding more water is when the real fun begins. If the spoon is hot enough, the drop can grow surprisingly wide. As it enlarges, it begins oscillating. The first oscillation mode looks like a blobby x. Adding more water adds more lobe pairs. A large drop resembles a frantically vibrating gear composed entirely of water. Add still more water, and\u2026 disaster! The dynamic outflow of steam that both supports the drop and drives the oscillations fails, and the water boils away within seconds.\r<br>\r<br>While this experiment is fun, easy to do at home, and not well known (I came up with it on my own in high school), it is not the primary point of this comment.\r<br>\r<br>So here is a question: If the silicone droplet experiment is a good model of the pilot wavey model of quantum mechanics, what does it say about the underlying nature of \u201cparticles\u201d in pilot wave theory?<br>\r<br>It says that _the droplets are not particles either_. They are just smaller waves.<br>\r<br>Suppose an experiment sends an electron through an exceptionally tiny hole. A common intuition is that the electron then becomes a \u201cparticle\u201d that sails in a straight path. Nothing is farther from the truth! The electron instead radiates outwards as a hemispherical wave, with its probability of \u201clanding\u201d being equal in all directions. It becomes <i>more</i> wave-like, not less.<br><br>The silicone drop and pilot-wave models of quantum mechanics suffer from the same subtle problem. Both superpose two versions of a particle\u2019s quantum wave function onto the same space at <i>one</i> moment in time.<br><br>In the entirely classical silicone droplets model, the droplet-wave and guiding-wave can genuinely exist simultaneously.\r In quantum mechanics, there can only ever be one wave at one time\u2026 ever.<br><br>This quantum insistence every entity having only one wave at any one moment in time is why the silicone droplet model, while instructive, is also profoundly deceptive. It creates an illusion of a separate particle by <i>superposing</i> the initial large wave with a much smaller post-observation \u201cparticle\u201d wave. The result is an illusion that the two waves can coexist in time. They cannot. Indeed, through entropy, each waveform\u2019s insistent isolation appears deeply linked to the nature of time itself.<br><br>\r<br>Finally, in fairness, pilot-wave theories are by no means the only quantum interpretations that engage in superposing quantum waves that experimentally can exist only at separate points in classical time. Quantum field theory is the gold star standard for the mathematically accurate prediction of quantum phenomena. Its success relies on superpositions of point-like particle states that are just as experimentally impossible and even more redundant than those of pilot-wave theory. There is a cost, however. Much of quantum field theory is devoted to issues such as vacuum energy, charge hiding, asymptotic freedom, and renormalization that are directly related to the impact of superposing wave functions that can only exist sequentially in physical reality.", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T18:06:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WhiteRabbit.", "comment_text": "Copenhagen interpretation is really just another flat earth conspiracy", "comment_date": "2021-01-22T12:29:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "KobraVR", "comment_text": "I kept thinking you would get carried away with hand gestures holding that toothpick and stab it in your eye", "comment_date": "2021-01-22T09:17:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick", "comment_text": "You have &#39;the gift&#39; that the best teachers have.

As if space it self is in reflection. There is no straight trajectory due to space time reflection. Space time is vibrating due to gravity. As the particle traverses Spacetime it&#39;s being toggled in a multiple directions. Since the toggle is constant and uniform each particle will at any given point land at any part of the board once it leaves the point of origin. Hence the reason why it seems to be a wave and a particle. I guess quantum physics has not considered all possible variables and the very structure of spacetime due to gravity. Gravity is one such variable and the mass of the celestial body which influences the trajectory of all objects in the universe. A pattern will eventually emerge as each particle hits or lands at different sections of the board at any given time. Eventually the pattern will be formed which then speculatively to me demonstrates that their is indeed a toggle in spacetime due to gravity in a uniform and constant but oscillating manner. This is what I call spacetime gravitational oscillation. Once you see the pattern you can work the math to predict the distance of these spacetime oscillations. Imagine a submarine traversing the ocean while submerged. Now imagine that there&#39;s a storm raging above making the ocean toggle with force. Even if the submarine is going in a straight path while submerged the submarine will be toggled in all directions due to the influence of the ocean toggles due to the storm. In this analogy the ocean is space time, the winds raging making the ocean uneasy is gravity, the submarine is the particle traveling in a forward trajectory while being toggled. I predict that if the double slit experiment is performed somewhere in space far away from all matter, and galaxies where the influence of these gravitational micro oscillations aren&#39;t present the particles will always land on the same spot all the time without forming a pattern. l also predict that if you set the experiment on the moon or any other celestial body smaller than earth, setting up the experiment with all similar conditions such as distance of the laser to the double slit board and the landing board the patter should be narrower than that on earth. The opposite should also be true if you set up the experiment in any other planet larger than earth, the pattern should be wider if performed on a larger celestial body. I know it sounds bunkers but it&#39;s likely to be true. Celestial bodies due to their gravity and it&#39;s influence on spacetime should alter the experiment depending on the celestial body&#39;s mass. The larger the mass of the celestial body the wider these spacetime gravitational oscillation should be, the opposite should also be true. I do not believe the Observer affects the result of the experiment and the  quantum physicists performing the experiment have not considered all variables, the effects of mass onto spacetime due to gravity being  such variable. Why should the mass of the body where the double slit experiment is being performed be considered? Simply because we know gravity does affect the trajectory of light. Gravitational lensing is a real thing at a macro level. At a micro level gravity still affect single photons. Keeping this in mind, in the future when we land on the moon again the experiment should be performed. My predictions, if true, should be apparent. This will only prove the current probability wave model is wrong, that the observer does not create reality, and it will also prove that space time is oscillating making the trajectory of particles toggle. The math can be worked on based on the particles trajectory and the statistical distribution to determine spacetime oscillations. These oscillation if indeed is true should then be compared to the double slit experiment test data performed on the moon, in contrast to that the test data on earth. The test data would be capture by simply measuring with high precision instruments the width and distance of each band of light forming in the background board of the double slit experiment. The measurement of the distance of the bands will then tell the story of how wide these oscillations are based on the celestial body&#39;s gravity due to its mass. Once you plug into the formula the celestial body&#39;s gravity then you can with certainty predict how these oscillations are present in any other celestial body&#39;s based on their gravity. Working the math would not be possible unless we can test this speculation in any other celestial body than here on earth. This is speculation which could be a hypothesis if we had a valid way to test this on the moon. Then if tested by others it most certainly would become a theory if other scientist get a type two error in their analysis. Failure to reject the null hypothesis would most certainly make it a real theory that spacetime is indeed oscillating.", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T04:06:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AynenMakino", "comment_text": "If quantum mechanics govern the larger world that we see, but the larger world is &#39;specific&#39; in it&#39;s location when it&#39;s based on a system that is non-specific, could it be that the larger world&#39;s exactness is actually an estimate, rather than a real thing?

An analogy of this is the weather. You can predict the percentage of it raining for the next 10 days, but after that, even with super computers, it is too chaotic to figure out.<br><br>Super position makes sense in a mathematical sense; if you bounce a  ball (quantum particle) in a room (field) and you close the door (you aren&#39;t observing it) then in a sense the ball is everywhere, but that doesn&#39;t mean it actually is happening (so the ball isn&#39;t literally everywhere, just somewhere but you dont know where.)<br><br><br><br>(By the way I\u2019m 12 years old)", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T19:20:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sergio Maia", "comment_text": "You did not talk about a key and fundamental different between quantum and the walkers experiment: the role of the observer, i.e. oberver and experiment are two completely separate and independent systems in the walkers experiment, but are not in quantum.

The catch being that they are both true but at only two different &quot;times&quot; in the existence of our known Universe.  Copenhagen/Wave-Particle Duality/Non-Determinism WAS the framework mechanics and physics of the primordial unborn Universe that we &quot;know&quot;, or should I say, imperfectly observe now.  C/W-PD/N-D was ALSO the framework mechanics and physics of ALL primordial unborn Universes (Many Worlds).  And this point the Many Worlds (Multiverse) are nothing but infinite possibilities of what the &quot;One&quot; Universe....our &quot;Observed&quot; Universe would become.  Nothing has been observed...wave and particle are just pure chaotic noise...nothing is determined.  However...as we know in Chaos Theory there is still information imbedded in the &quot;randomness&quot;.  It just takes time to for the pattern to emerge and be recognized.  <br><br>Now, consider an &quot;Observer&quot; coming into play.  Call the &quot;Observer&quot; God...or call it the moment that all the Many Worlds &quot;observed&quot; each other through a process of tiny perturbations of Quantum Gravity as these Many Worlds began to interact with one another coming closer and closer.  Harmonic Resonances began to form between these Branes manifesting themselves in particle entanglement not only inside each Brane (Universe) but also BETWEEN each of the other Branes (Universes).  Once there was enough entanglement between each of these Universes there was the manifestation of an &quot;Observation&quot;.  In other words....now each Primordial Non-Deterministic pure Chaos Universe each with its own set of infinite possibilities collapsed on themselves once they &quot;Observed&quot; each other.  The Ultimate Wave Function Collapse.  Also, by default, the largest, most dense Black Hole that will ever exist.  And as we know now, there is no &quot;Singularity&#39;&#39; where all information is destroyed.  Therefore....what is flowing out of this Collapsed Wave Function of Non Deterministic Multiverses is a now a singular Deterministic &quot;Observed&quot; Universe.   Copenhagen/Wave-Particle Duality/Non-Determinism/Many Worlds FIRST....de-Broglie-Bohme Pilot Wave/Determinism second.  <br><br>Now...consider Fractal Theory.  As we know in Fractal Theory the overarching pattern of any given Fractal set is manifested again and again as you drill down the set.  There are perturbations and slight mutations to be sure but as you go down into a Fractal you see the overall Macro pattern reproduced continuously into the Micro.  And this is just the 2D version.  In a 3D Fractal once you are inside it may take you forever to see the Macro pattern.  It&#39;s there to be sure.  But as a &quot;tiny&quot; observer inside the 3D Fractal each individual spot you are at looks like noise...randomness.  You can&#39;t observe a clear pattern as of yet.  But it&#39;s there.  You just need time to make enough observations....to make a multitude of &quot;choices&quot; of which way you want to go in your &quot;mapping&quot; quest of this giant 3D Fractal shape you are in.  But in the end...once you have taken all your choices of direction and observation you will see the &quot;Big Picture&quot;.  You will see the Macro pattern.  You will also find that the whole thing was already &quot;Pre-Determined&quot;.  The Fractal pattern was already set.  It was already determined before you were placed inside the 3D Fractal pattern.  However...due to the ENORMITY of the pattern and all its sub-patterns and sub-sub patterns you had a near infinite amount of choices by which to map out the internal and external shape of the 3D Fractal you were in.  You DID exercise &quot;Free Will&quot;.  You chose your own path each and every step of the way.  In fact... there was a near infinite amount of choices you could make in your trip in and through and outside the 3D Fractal.  However, in the end...your final revelation was Pre-Determined  all along. <br><br>The same holds true for our &quot;Observed&quot; singular Universe.  The patterns of ALL the infinite possibilities from all the Primordial Chaotic Universes before they collapsed into our one singular Universe ARE STILL THERE in our Universe.  The Non-Deterministic Wave-Particle Duality of the Multiverse still exists in our Pilot Wave Deterministic Universe which even includes what we call &quot;Free Will&quot;.  But to use an analogy...our Universe is like one of those &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books.  The story....OUR story has already been written.  The Fractal Design has already been made even in its seemingly infinitely complex and random form.  It has a beginning and it has an end.  However....because there are MULTIPLE choices of plot changes in this &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book (the Non-Deterministic Multiverse pre-Big Bang) that we can CHOOSE (&quot;Free Will&quot;) the ending of the story can also change.  However....post Big Bang...the book was written with an ending.  To be sure.....there are MULTIPLE ENDINGS based on a MULTITUDE of possibilities.  That pattern from the Primordial Multiverse is still in this our Observed Universe.  However...even though there are multiple endings.....you will arrive at ONLY ONE ending once you exercise your &quot;Free Will&quot; in choosing from one of the possible choices all along the way.  Your own &quot;Free Will&quot; choice collapses your own infinite Wave Function of possibilities into a Particle of Pre-Determined &quot;Destiny&quot;.   This is how Free Will and Determinism can co-exist.  Your &quot;Pilot Wave&quot; was determined the moment the &quot;Big Bang happened.  But through your own &quot;Free Will&quot; you are, every waking &quot;Nanosecond&quot;, discovering how you are manifesting that Pilot Wave and where it is taking you as a Particle to your final destination from Point A to Point B.", "comment_date": "2020-05-21T11:33:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frisbieinstein", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t this a model of the Bohm theory?  <br><br>Good luck explaining Stern-Gerlach or entanglement with this.

But the analogy is even closer if we take note of the fact that each particle generates a wave that moves with it and at the same time interacts with its wave.\r<br>You say it is only fair that there are two theories that confront each other, but you don&#39;t go to the further explanation. Why are there two theories that confront each other when we need to give a general explanation, a framework for data? The two approaches, one indefinite subjective and the other deterministic objective, reflect the usual distinction that has always existed in philosophy between idealistic and materialistic approaches. For idealists the primordial element is the idea, for materialists the primordial element is matter.\r<br>Philosophy and therefore science are influenced by the dominant ideology, that is, by the type of society. The idealist philosophy is the product of a society that is still too underdeveloped and that still retains the difference in classes. Idealist philosophy and indeterministic science are the reflection of a society divided into classes, in which the ruling class accepting the objectivity of the world must consequently accept its transience. its own end. The idea that nothing is objective gives him more hope. I think you know that Debroglie has suffered the hostility of McCarthyism. Furthermore, common sense is closer to metaphysics (separate categories) than to dialectics, in which categories are intertwined, as in reality. But if reality reflects what appears obvious to common sense then science would not be needed.\r<br>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s useful that there are two opposing theories, I think this reflects a class clash, due to the class society in which we find ourselves. The dominant view in science reflects the dominant consciousness, which is the consciousness of the ruling class. Whether scientists are conscientious or not.\r<br>Determinism is the science of tomorrow, that is, of a classless society. In a classless society, the subjective and indeterministic vision will disappear. This does not mean that there will not be a theoretical discussion between different theories that must frame the observations, but all theories will be guided by a dialectical materialistic philosophy.\r<br>It has often happened to me to clash against the subjectivist and indeterministic position in the interpretation of the double slit, but for some time I had come to your own conclusions thanks to the teachings of the masters of dialectical materialism. I report below my recent reply to the subjective-indeterminists:\r<br>&quot;After seeing the image given by the experiment (double slit) it is clear that the particle is both particle and wave. And there is nothing strange, since everybody, macroscopic or microscopic, is associated with a wave And it is not the wave of probability, it is the wave of the field associated with the body in motion. Something real, not a statistical mathematical concept. The electron, particle, moves with its electromagnetic field and with the wave that it generates. How the sun moves with its gravitational field wave. Imagine the drops of water on vibrating viscous material. The pilot-wave dynamics of walking droplets.\r<br>So there is no need to introduce the probability wave. It only serves to forcefully introduce - the reality of the experiment disappears, replaced by the wave of probability - a non-deterministic setting, so the electron is wave only when I see it, I measure it. First it is nothing, neither wave nor particle. The purpose of science is to find the laws of movement of objective reality, which pre-exists, with its objective laws of movement, to the subject who wants to know it. So it is independent of the subject. The fact that the subject does not know where the object is, is just a problem of the subject, the object does not care and follows its usual laws of movement. The fact that we resort to probability does not mean denying determinism, objective reality. The statistical or probability result is the result of deterministic cause-effect relationships, many causes cause a statistical result, which highlights the laws, the underlying objective regularities. The impossibility of simultaneously measuring the position and speed of a particle does not mean that the particle does not have its position and speed. And the exclusively probabilistic representation of the position of the electron in its orbit is only due to the subject&#39;s ignorance of the underlying laws. But the observations on the electron movement, however probabilistic, do not say that it can be anywhere. They will always be in a point of a certain orbit, and this is objective, and also with a distribution of position on the orbit, over time, from which objective laws, rules, order from chaos emerge. The cause-effect objective relationship is demonstrated by the observations. The case is random because it is causal. The temperature of a body we could measure it knowing the measure of the speed of each single particle. But we prefer to measure the macroscopic data, from which we deduce the average speed of the component particles. But not all particles objectively have the average speed, whether or not the subject knows the speed of each particle.\r<br>The electron moves with its electromagnetic field wave.\r<br>The dominant subjective approach fails to be scientific, because it is not dialectical enough. Yet the platypus dialectic exists &quot;\r<br>irst of all, thanks for the brilliant explanation and for letting me know an experiment that confirms even more the dialectical, therefore deterministic and objective materialistic vision of reality, compared to idealistic and metaphysical speculations, that is, subjectivism and indeterminism.\r<br>I suggest you a reading that highlights the clash between idealistic and materialistic philosophy in the scientific field.\r<br>Dualism Wave-Particle and the Value of the Scientific Theory in Bohr.

This means atoms are spinning billions of times a second. All of us consist of 7 billion billion billion atoms, each one spinning/vibrating billions of times a second as energy and light. It takes constant creation for these waves to resonate into quarks which are 3 points of light. AND there has to be all the information it takes to build one of us contained within those quarks.

For as is proved briefly in the First Indication of the Tenth Word and in detail in the Twenty-Second Word, if every particle is not an official of God acting with His permission and under His authority, and if it is not undergoing change within His knowledge and power, then every particle must have infinite knowledge and limitless power; it must have eyes that see everything, a face that looks to all things, and authority over all things. For every particle of the elements acts, or can act, in an orderly fashion in all animate beings. But the order within things and laws according to which they are formed differ from one thing to the next. If their order was not known to the particles, the particles could not act, or even if they could act, they could not act without error. In which case, the particles which are performing their duties in beings are either acting with the permission and at the command, and within the knowledge and at the will, of the owner of an all-encompassing knowledge, or they themselves must have such an all-encompassing knowledge and power. Yes, all particles of air can enter the bodies of all animate beings, the fruits of all flowers, and the structures of all leaves. They can act within them, although the way the beings are formed is all different and their order and systems quite distinct. As though the factory of a fig was a loom for weaving cloth and the factory of a pomegranate, a machine for producing sugar, and so on; the programmes of their structures and bodies all differ from each other. A particle of air, then, enters or can enter all of them. It takes up its position and acts in a wise and masterly fashion without error. And on completion of its duty it departs. A mobile particle of mobile air, therefore, either must know the forms, shapes, measures, and formations with which plants and animals, and even fruits and flowers, are clothed, or else it must be an official acting under the command and will of one who does know. Similarly with a stationary particle of stationary earth: since it has the ability to be the means and place of cultivation for all the seeds of all flowering plants and fruit-bearing trees, either there must be in the particle itself or in the handful of soil that is its little house immaterial machinery and factories in good working order to the number of the varieties of the trees and plants, and flowers and fruits in fact, it is in every single particle that there must be a factory peculiar to it and all the equipment and machinery necessary for the running of the factory or else it must have a miraculous knowledge that knows all things about all things and a miracle-working power that creates everything from nothing; or, those duties are performed at the command and with the permission of One Who is Knowing of All Things, and through the power and might of One Who is Absolutely Powerful over All Things. If an untrained and inexperienced, common, ordinary, and blind man was to go to Europe and in all the factories there to work at all the trades and crafts in perfect and masterly fashion, and if he was to display a wise and artistic skill to such a degree that it left everyone speechless with amazement, anyone with a grain of consciousness would know that the man was not acting on his own initiative, but that a master of all trades was teaching him and causing him to work. And if there was a blind and impotent man who lived in a simple little house and was unable even to rise from his place, and if small fragments of stone, and bits and pieces of material like bone and cotton were to enter his little house and then sacks of sugar, bales of cloth, crates of jewelry, finely-made clothes encrusted with jewels, and delicious foods were to emerge, would anyone with a grain of intelligence not say: &quot;That man is a wretched doorkeeper or merely a latch on the door of the factory of a wondrous miracle-working being, which is the source of his miracles&quot;? In exactly the same way, the motion and duties of particles of air in plants and trees, and blossom and fruit, all of which are missives of the Eternally Besought One, antique dominical works of art, miracles of power, and wonders of wisdom, indicate that the particles are acting under the command and at the will of an All-Wise and Glorious Maker, an All-Generous and Beauteous Creator. Particles of earth, also, since they are the source and means for the shoots and plants produced by seeds, each of which is a different factory and workbench, a different printing-press, treasury, and antique, a different manifesto proclaiming the Glorious Maker&#39;s Names and ode hymning His perfections, it is as definite as two plus two equalling four that the particles of earth are acting at the command, with the permission, and through the will and power of an All-Glorious Maker Who is Lord of the command of &quot;Be!&quot; and it is, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 36:82, etc.} and to Whose command everything is subjugated.

The uptake of h2o and transformation of light into growth on a cellular level.. yes this was and is very hard to word seeing as it is describing a plant&#39;s consumption and transportation of nutrients and growth on a cellular level ... there is only one other thing this experience could have been and not sure if it was this or that but could of been human digestion on a cellular level, the human being my self.. but all of these scenarios all are from certain times when space and time as we have come to know in our conscious mind where altered in a state where time and space and normal perception of reality where not present.. and finally this following statement may help the task at hand or I might just be limited to my ability to describe in words what I am about to say.. seeing as it is more of a feeling on a cellular level but everything has connections to everything.. and here we go ..but maybe the double split experiment and why those patterns develop is because there is no such thing as a true base line.. well there is but the forces of the universe are coming into play such as and just an example the earth&#39;s spin and other circumstances of larger objects (moon, planets,  sun) and other endless possibilities effecting the spin on the particles. Take shooting a pool ball with different speeds and spins as an example, the outcome of where the ball will land after hitting a rail depends on speed and spin very much so like the particles  in the double slit experiment.. except there is the forces of the universe never being exactly the same at any given time in relation to the sun and planets and dark matter all effecting the spin of the particles on that smallest of scales.. ya this would be mathematically impossible to register and maybe I am not explaining to words as well as I can feel the effects on the bigger or smallest of scales so to speak..", "comment_date": "2019-03-24T07:20:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Passive Aggressive Flamingo", "comment_text": "Please help!

(<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_cone)\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_cone)</a><br><br>So, a vertical column of gasses and magma mix to form cinders that accumulate around the column in an anthill formation, essentially, right? <br><br>The cinders are very light bc the rock and magma have combined under pressure to restructure it...like a life jacket has bubbles of air to help us float... except it would be more like a human with a built in life jacket, which is a disturbing analogy but I\u2019m bereft of a better one, so let\u2019s go with it please...<br><br>Ok, so liquid magma and gas, combined with geologically low(ish) pressure form an anthill of cinders that are lighter the magma still ushering vertically from inside the earth, right? <br><br>Because the cinder anthill\u2019s flimsy core can\u2019t support the thick magma to make it erupt like a typical volcano, it begins to push up into the core, finds this lack of stability and spurred on by the aforementioned pressure, seeks an alternate pathway by oozing under the cinders instead, eventually forming a foundation of sorts. <br><br>Now, my questions are, is this the same principle? Or theory or whatever? The video shows the droplet doesn\u2019t always escape a barrier but when it does, does it always go over or under or both? <br><br>I have a geological theory I\u2019m trying to gel in my mind, but I\u2019m stuck until I know this for sure. I feel like the answer is RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, and I\u2019m overcomplicating , oversimplifying or overlooking  something. <br><br>Thank you to anyone who is willing to help me!", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T22:21:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duke Silvergold", "comment_text": "Walkers!", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T06:19:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Helge Samuelsen", "comment_text": "Even the Waves in the Ocean have Quantum-like behaviour.

The reason is quite simple - the measurement problem cannot be solved in the standard Copenhagen interpretation. In addition, the Copenhagen interpretation is Positivistic in nature - i.e. things that cannot be observed do not exist - a standard fallacy known to Newton. Special relativity may be made consistent with faster than light signals by simply adopting earlier Lorentzian interpretation (special reference frame) rather than Einsteinian or Minkowskian interpretation. In addition, both Einsteinian and Minkwskian interpretation are positivistic as well. Positivism  is refuted in the 1940&#39;s and I am astonished that physicists remain so persistent positivists. Multiple problems in physics can be solved by abandoning positivism (only things that are measured are meaningful). Problem 1 - special reference frame could resurrect the aether (today called quantum vacuum). Electromagnetic theory could finally be rational by explaining what the electric field is. Problem 2 - Special reference frame could solve the problem of energy-momentum tensor in gravity theory which now is not solved. Problem 3 - Nonlocal hidden variable theories can be used. Even in the standard Copenhagen interpretation non-locality persists as is evident in the EPR problem, Problem 4 - The A theory of time (the common sense theory of time that time flows and only present exists) is resurrected, Problem 5 - Gravity will be just an ordinary field (tensor field) not curved &#39;space-time&#39; and can be quantized, Problem 6 - Only if special reference frames exist many paradoxes in quantum gravity can be explained - Unruh-Davies paradox for instance and a single quantum vacuum can be chosen, Problem 6 - complex space-time intervals in special relativity will be avoided (space-like intervals are complex), Problem 7 - time and space will be decoupled as they should - they are very different in their ontology and they are treated in asymmeterical manner in quantum physics, Problem 8 - The multiple paradoxes in Einsteinian interpretation - Bell&#39;s spaceship paradox for instance, Problem 9 - time and space will become absolute - only the measuring apparatuses will be altered by moving through space, Problem 10 - The measurement problem in quantum mechanics could be solved by postulating non-local hidden variable theory.

It splits the space fabric into its electro magnetic sub elements and the energy is pushed through that disturbance...That&#39;s why Photon behaves as a wave and particle at the same time. The movement of energy gives the affect of particle. The disturbance caused by the energy in the form of Electro magnetism forms the wave. The speed of this disturbance is the speed of the light (another property of the space time fabric).<br><br>This space dynamics happen with every sub atomic particle like electrons, protons etc. They and their inherent energy, interacts with the space time fabric.

So much is misunderstood due to bias and fantasies of well known physicists having imposed their mere perspectives as being reality. That&#39;s why the Copenhagen interpretation has dominated. It&#39;s also why M-theory dominates even though general relativity shows that gravitation is an interaction between\u00a0mass and space meaning that gravitation is not a fundamental force and that there is no such thing as a graviton or quantum gravity. Since the Lorentz factors prevent mass from being compressed to its Schwarzschild radius, black holes also do not exist and are not the accurate descriptions of objects at the centers of galaxies. Black holes are by no means predicted by general relativity as is often claimed. There is also no incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics as is often claimed. There is only an imposed quantum \u00a0perspective of gravitation that is incompatible with general relativity.

In the pilot wave theory, the pilot waves are not any disturbance created by the particle, rather it is part of the particle itself, only we choose to give it a different name. So, while in the droplet two-slit expt, the droplet going through a particular slit, interacts with the disturbance passing through both the slits, in the pilot wave theory, the &quot;particle&quot; going through a particular slit, interacts with its own &quot;pilot wave&quot;. In other words, the particle going through one slit, interacts with a part of itself which went through the other slit. But this is what we say in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, that particle passes through both the slits, and interferes with itself.

How does a particle &quot;feel&quot; when it&#39;s going to decay?  Chance is a human made concept, involving our lack of knowledge, which is then applied to, say a dice, and in this picture if you roll a perfect dice, the chances are one sixth of each number on the dice in the limit of an infinite amount of rolls of the dice. Now how can you objectivize this human concept and apply it to the interpretation of QM, while hidden variables are much more objective and offer a neat explanation of the so-called inherently, irreducible chance interpretation of the Copenhagen interpretation? For the Brown-particle in a fluid, the movements are not inherently chance based. There is even an uncertainty relation developed for the Brown-particle.

And as these particles bounce on the space time fabric, the interaction with space time is what brings about their random behaving, much like the water oil droplets.  At one point, some of the droplets clumped up, and almost formed their own little divot in space time.  Could it be that other forces such as electro static binds some of these, and this clump now loosely interacting with space/time create a bend in the fabric, which also might explain gravity.  As shown in the experiment, as the particles pass thru the slits, but the waves interfere with each other.  Could it be that the slits, could be interpreted as a dense mass body, interfering with the space/time fabric?

The idea is that the motion of the particle and its position in space is larger than the tolerances of the experiment, in this case, the wave motion outside of the droplet is greater than the difference between the two slits. It explains why the distribution of outcomes seems to be directly related to the two slits even if the &quot;particle&quot; passes through one slit only and also why the observer can affect the outcome because if an observer is near one of the two slits they become part of the experiment. It seems to me to be the application of okams razor to say the phenonium of the two slit experiment is due to an extended yet unseen field around the particle that is affected by both slits than it is to describe it as a superposition. I think that a particle will also appear to behave differently in a vacuum, a gas or in a liquid or solid because this &quot;external&quot; wave will be affected differently. When striking the plate at the back this external and wave-particle &quot;collapses&quot; to what appears to be a point perhaps because the particle is now in the presence of many more particles in the same volume the solid screen.

You just have to think about gravity a little differently. Instead of working directly on the particle to attract it, gravity (mass) repels the particle\u2019s pilot wave, pushing the wave out from under the particle and causing the particle to bounce toward the gravity source. I imagine the pilot waves would tend to move similarly to gas, in that gas moves from high-pressure areas to areas of lower pressure, and so the pilot waves would move from areas of high mass density to areas of lower mass density.

I&#39;m curious if we&#39;ll see that in spite of the fact that it appears to be the same, yet separate, &#39;particle&#39; bouncing around, that we&#39;ll actually discover that the wave, and the droplet are actually entangled.  It is this question, at its root, that has caused me to question heisenberg.  In my theory I hypothesize that the particle exists as an extension of the wave, and visa versa and is simply a construction of interference patterns that form a closed node.  If the droplet takes on the color of the base material, it implies more than just guidance by the wave and that they are more than a simple sum of their parts.<br><br>I find this observable behavior fascinating, and wonder how far we can push the similarities in Bohmian Mechanics or an extended Bohmian mechanics, a theory I&#39;m working on.  I&#39;m positing that the oil is similar to a possible &#39;universal&#39; medium, the nothingness from which we observe the dual nature of the nothing from which particles and their anti-particles emerge from the nothing only to return.  Can we &#39;make&#39; a sound wave that exhibits apparent random behavior of bringing droplets into existence.  Barring that, it&#39;s behavior acting similar to space-time itself is interesting of itself by acting as a medium for the pilot wave.  How far can we go with this medium.  <br><br>Can we bring about a set of frequencies in the medium that not only bring about spontaneous creation of droplets that have other similar behaviors, while simultaneously causing existing droplets of a certain internal structure that will persist?  Studying how this is NOT the same as the medium of space-time can be as informative as it&#39;s actual imitation of it provides.  <br><br>It&#39;s interesting to note that the wave is 3D, although the droplet is also 3D it exhibits behavior beyond that of the 3D of the wave in that it is nodal.  If we consider observing the moment of contact, this acts as a two dimensional intersection, though by interaction, the droplet and wave spend a lot of time separate from either of them also in 3D space.  If we take this as a &#39;time slowed&#39; imitation of the quantum or bohmian states, we might think upon how the observable universe consists of unobservable or indirectly observable waves, intersecting with the observable particle droplet, perhaps our quantum observations could exist only at the intersection representing reality, particle wave dualities.  And, therefore, perhaps the main difference between this as an experiment would be akin to playing in a higher dimension which imitates some lower dimensional properties that exist in QM, and more correlations could exist than those observed at first blush.<br><br>Of course, without experiments and observations, I&#39;m only presenting concepts here; whether they stand up to this close of a scrutiny would have to be &#39;discovered&#39;.", "comment_date": "2017-03-16T19:21:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K_ Ralph", "comment_text": "Pretty sick how a photon moves at the fastest possible speed while its bouncing arround like it doesent know where to go.

I came up with my own model which I find easier to use: You can basically picture the electron ITSELF as behaving similar to a liquid - with one important difference (I&#39;ll come to it). In my model the electron forms a perfect shell around the nucleus of the atom, forming a standing wave, that pulses at lightspeed. The &quot;electron-shells&quot; of the atom are the stable frequencies of this electron-wave. The &quot;stable shells&quot; exist, because the waves don&#39;t interact much in that configuration. Electrons leave an atom not randomly, but when the interacting waves push a wave-peak far enough from the nucleus to form a &quot;droplet&quot; (electron). A free moving electron actually &quot;tries&quot; to form a particle (&quot;droplet&quot;) - BUT (here&#39;s the trick) of course we know an electron is bound to ALWAYS move at lightspeed, so the electron CAN&#39;T form a particle, but has to stay a smeared out cloud (Heisenberg) - UNTIL it interacts with something (measurement) allowing it do &quot;condensate&quot; to a particle-droplet shape. I have no idea if that model &quot;officially&quot; exists and has a name (comment if you know!!!), but since I came up with it, it was my favorite model. It makes it very easy to picture quantum phenomenons (most appear out of nowhere using this image), but this model also gets rid of pretty much ALL randomness in quantum physics, as well as the particle/wave duality problem.

A &quot;photon&quot; is an actual electromagnetic wave WHICH DOES NOT MOVE WITHIN A MATERIAL (aether) which would be required to create a &quot;pilot wave&quot;. And its intensity distribution is a continuous electromagnetic\u00a0field with total energy hf=[m(p)](c^2). For such a field one can calculate a centre-of-mass. A photon-wave can act in different ways. (1). It can be emitted by a source so that\u00a0its centre-of-mass moves with speed c along a straight path like a &quot;point-particle&quot;. It is however still ONLY a wave with distributed EM wave-fronts!(2). It can be emitted by a source to spread out in different directions. The path that its centre-of-mass follows is now determined by the wave-fronts spreading in different directions with speed c.\u00a0(3) When such a wave, whether it is spreading or not spreading, encounters boundary-conditions with which it resonates, it has to immediately (faster than the speed of light if required) morph in shape and size in order to adapt to these boundary-conditions.Now let us look at the diffraction of single photons through a double slit: A photon arrives at the\u00a0slits. If it resonates with these slits, it morphs in shape an size and, since is energy is continuously distributed, it can easily flow through both slits at the same time so that two waves with wave-fronts emerge on the other side of the slits.\u00a0The two sub-waves interfere (while their joint centre-of-mass keeps on moving towards the screen) in order to spread-out ands form diffracted wave-fronts while\u00a0\u00a0as they approach the detection screen. Within the detection-screen there are zillions of detecting atoms\u00a0with which this wave can resonate. The probability that it resonates with a specific detector is modulated by the intensity-distribution of the diffracted wave-fronts. THIS DOES\u00a0NOT MEAN THAT THIS INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION IS AN ACTUAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION!!Since the wave resonates with a specific detector its centre-of-mass will change its direction of motion in order to move to this detector at which it must end up owing to this resonance-interaction.\u00a0The probability for a single photon-wave to move to any one of the detectors in the screen is stupidly called Heisenberg&#39;s &quot;uncertainty-relationship&quot; for momentum and position. However, this probability is not an inherent part of the wave, but is caused by the fact that the incoming diffracted wave-fronts can resonate with any of the detectors in the screen. It is the SAME probability one has with a roulette wheel. Since the centre of mass of the wave moves into the detector with which it resonates, the rest of the wave morphs in shape and size to stop at the detector as a smaller wave, thus leaving a &quot;pixel&quot;-point at the position of the detector. Since many identical diffracted photon-waves will end up at points at different detectors in the screen, the intensity of the identically diffracted wave-0fronts for each photon-wave MUST appear on the screen. Since this follows directly from the\u00a0nature of wave interactions as modelled by\u00a0Maxwell&#39;s wave equations no &quot;weird QM&quot; is involved. This is how an ensemble of identical coherent waves\u00a0 MUST act.If you are now stupid and set up detectors at the slits to see through which slit the wave is moving, the wave is detected when it resonates with such a detector. It thus morphs in shape size and direction of motion, so that the wave-fronts moving towards the screen are now NOT diffracted anymore: And Voila, there is not a diffraction pattern any more.If Einstein&#39;s logic did not fail him (as it has done in many cases) he could have derived already in 1905 \u00a0from the Lorentz-transformation that a moving electron is\u00a0a coherent single EM wave with continuously-distributed EM energy; for which its frequency also follows from hf(e)=[m(e)](c^2). This wave moves with a phase speed c*=v/(c^2) but with a real speed v, so that it has a de Broglie wavelength lambda=h/(mv).\u00a0\u00a0Thus the diffraction of single electron waves occurs exactly in the same manner as the diffraction of a single photon-wave.The fact is that Maxwell&#39;s equations are unified with the behaviour of &quot;quantum-waves&quot; as one expects from reality that it must be. In addition, when not using Minkowski&#39;s absurd and impossible space-time, the bending of light within a field of gravity can be directly proved by using the Lorentz transformation for which the speed of light must always be c: ALSO WITHIN A FIELD OF GRAVITY.\u00a0By reluctantly invoking &quot;curved space-time&quot; Einstein was forced to argue (incorrectly) that the speed of light can be different than c within a field of gravity.", "comment_date": "2016-11-28T12:50:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "valeriaH223", "comment_text": "So beautiful, I had to cry", "comment_date": "2016-11-28T09:25:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve the Plumber", "comment_text": "Veritasium,<br>You are erroneously throwing around the word &quot;deterministic&quot;.<br>The Copenhagen interpretation doesn&#39;t require that we discard determinism to function.", "comment_date": "2016-11-28T09:24:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cjshaker", "comment_text": "Pilot Wave.

I don&#39;t go further to check the math behind it as it is mind boggling to me. I am fascinated by how Einstein had given a brilliant explanation to how gravity works. It convinced me to believe in the theory. But when I looked into the explanations from Quantum Mechanics, I didn&#39;t have the same feeling due to its probabilistic nature of it. After seeing this video, I am now more interested in Pilot Wave theory. <br><br>This is the thought that came to my mind. By Quantum Mechanics, we could probably find a photon at any location in a probability wave that is moving forward in the path of the photon. By this, I understand (correct me if I am wrong), a probability wave of one photon doesn&#39;t affect the probability wave of another photon. Now with pilot wave theory, if the photon is actually moving through some medium that is causing the wave, the wave of one photon will affect the other. Please tell me what is the expected results of the below experiment. <br><br>Say I have two slits, and have two photon guns. For experiment, let me assume, one photon gun will always fire the photon through one slit and another will fire it though another always. Now fire one photon at a time from each photon gun, with a very slight delay. If my understanding is right, by Quantum Mechanics, it will produce two strips. But by Pilot wave theory, if the delay is very very small, the wave created by the photon from electron fired first, will interfere with the wave of the second photon, and thus creating a different output for the delayed photons. <br><br>I am no expert in this, and all the knowledge I have is through the videos I see from YouTube.

(I wish we&#39;d come up with a better term than &#39;quantum&#39;). Every &#39;thing&#39; is energy. Matter is energy. Matter is energy in various patterns or conformations. Energy, as we interpret it, has a wave function. It&#39;s a 3-D wave. It&#39;s not in a specific location. It&#39;s in a pattern of whatever energy is. Another useful word (symbol) for what&#39;s going on is &#39;field&#39;. Energy has the quality of being a field at any moment of time. This remains the case even when energy is in a conformation we call &#39;matter&#39;. There is no encapsulated &#39;electron&#39; being shot through the double-slit experiment. Instead it is a 3-D field confronting the double-slit and it behaves accordingly.<br><br>That field, I would expect, has exactly the same properties as gravity, which leads into what I consider to be the fact that all energy has the property of gravity, or basically energy is gravity whereby interacting energy fields create the property of gravity. When energy becomes a conformation pattern that we call &#39;matter&#39;, a great deal of energy makes up that pattern, enough for we mere humans to be able to observe the gravitational characteristics. When outside those patterns, the individual (if there is such a thing) fields of energy are too &#39;small&#39; for us to detect any properties of gravity.<br><br>I imagine that the attraction of any &#39;single&#39; energy field pattern to another &#39;single&#39; energy field dissipates according to Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation. Energy is attracted to energy. Each &#39;field&#39;, our attempt to unitize energy, interacts with every other &#39;field&#39; around it resulting in what we observe as quantum behavior. There are other attraction and repulsion properties that are part of these field interaction. They become concentrated or increase in density according to how much energy is within a particular conformation or &#39;particle&#39;. Therefore, we observe the pattern system we call an &#39;electron&#39; having an overall repulsion from the energy pattern we call a &#39;proton&#39;. Apparently, it takes a lot less coalesced energy to create the &#39;negative&#39; property than it does the &#39;positive&#39; property. Exactly what it is in these pattern systems that focuses or filters these &#39;negative&#39; or &#39;positive&#39; properties may be as simple as spin, whatever 3-D &#39;spin&#39; may be. But at all times, every energy pattern, every &#39;particle&#39;, remains attracted to every other within its energy &#39;field&#39; via the property of gravity.<br><br>The interactions we see between energy fields in its various conformations involve all three of these properties (and likely other behaviors that my tiny brain has yet to know of or consider). This very much reminds me of your experiment here where matter, or &#39;massive&#39; energy conformation fields, are interacting.<br><br>Verifiable insights that inform all of the above are always welcome.

can operate at the\u00a0atomic level.Just to give you the gist of my findings, there are actually two different wave functions: one of which I call Electron Wave Function, and the other, Group Wave Function.\u00a0 As we all know, an atom is a complex physical reality because it contains both real and imaginary things.\u00a0 It is also a hybrid form of different physical entities and attributes.Electron Wave Function is a mathematical physical principle that determines the true or real momentum of the electron being studied.\u00a0 It can operate only when the electron wave interference does exist, which can only happen when the electron in question is at the ground state.\u00a0 So when the electron in question is\u00a0in the excited state, the electron wave function stop operating, a.k.a. wave function collapse, which is similar to closing one of the slits in the double slit experiment.A Group Wave Function is also a mathematical physical principle that determines the net effective intensity of the electric field emanating from the entire group of charged particles (electrons and protons) enclosed by the atomic boundary.\u00a0 It is also collapsible like electron wave function whenever the atom is in the excited state but it can also operate momentarily each time the atom is in the act of being observed.\u00a0 When the Group Wave Function is operating, the electron in question is said to be in resonant state or behaving like oscillator, similar to the explanation of the &quot;Pilot Wave Theory.&quot;\u00a0 However, the behavior of\u00a0the group wave function\u00a0can be easily and\u00a0commonly misconstrued as the science covering all different quantum interpretations known to physicists, including the Copenhagen interpretation.There is no such thing as superposition.\u00a0 It only appears in mathematics that can be explained in terms of the group wave function.Entanglement is actually the entanglement between the past and future events because the atom can memorize the past.\u00a0 This entanglement can also be explained in terms of the group wave function.There is no such thing as the electron in question being anywhere at the same time before the atom is in the act of being observed because such notion violates the law of energy conservation.\u00a0 In other words, the atom cannot establish the adiabatic state or condition with such notion.\u00a0 There is a physical reality in the atom, which I call &quot;latent energy,&quot; that the amount of which can only be revealed when the atom is in the act of being observed.\u00a0 This latent energy is a reactive thing or imaginary.\u00a0 Physicists used the word &quot;eigenstate&quot; as a placeholder for this latent energy.\u00a0 The information about this eigenstate is also contained in the group wave function.\u00a0 I am beginning to believe that a group of eigenstates can explain the notion about the multi-dimension.I am also planning to publish a second book that also contains some illustrations to show some examples how to apply the atomic principles when it comes to predicting the ionization energies and spectral lines of\u00a0different atoms, ions and molecules.\u00a0 My real intention is to explain what the atom is really doing whether you are looking at it or not.\u00a0 I am also considering posting my new scientific findings on YouTube for free.", "comment_date": "2016-11-14T08:00:49Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Oblivion void", "comment_text": "well this made time travel possible. zero point energy . 3,6,9. it&#39;s all adding up.", "comment_date": "2016-11-14T07:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick MacDonald", "comment_text": "So +Vertitasium quantum particles create waves in the Higgs Field creating a Pilot Wave which then determines the particles momentum?

Two electrons need two pilot waves.  Just what is it that&#39;s doing the waving?  In the demo with the dancing drops, it&#39;s the surface of the water or oil, a single &quot;universal&quot; shared entity filling space, with one wavefunction - height above the average surface.

Right into a piece of metal.  There&#39;s be a circular pilot wave escorting it along until the electron stops - does the pilot wave suddenly stop?  All at once?  Does the part of it near the electron suddenly stop along with the electron while the outer parts continue? Is there an outward ring of sudden-slowing of the PW, expanding at the speed of light?

Rather, it is the waves acting like waves. Liquid waves and sound waves naturally produce an interference pattern if the wave is broken up by slits. If I had a large scale version of this, say an ocean wave, and build a giant wall with two slits, then another wall at the shore, I would get an interference pattern at the wall along the shore. If I had a skilled surfer ride that wave, through a slit, then ride the resulting breaking up of that wave, he would end up randomly someone on that interference pattern. If he did this enough times, he would end up in the &quot;center&quot; of the interference pattern more often than anywhere else. That isn&#39;t similar to the double slit experiment.

The droplet actually appears in the center (foci) of the ellipse. The electrons don&#39;t, thus why the foci is known as a mirage. Also, the electrons are found often at the edges, which the image shows of the electron in the quantum corral. <br><br>So I don&#39;t see two competing theories because you haven&#39;t really shown similarities and in other experiments, such as the quantum eraser experiment, the pilot theory would even come close to producing similar results.", "comment_date": "2016-11-08T21:27:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Aksenov", "comment_text": "I love this experiment!

I don&#39;t thing that there&#39;s any fundamental contradiction between the Copenhagen Interpretation and the Pilot Wave Visualisation. As I understand it, the Copenhagen Interpretation doesn&#39;t aim to describe the nature of the electron itself \u2014or any other particle\u2014, it only aims to describe its movement and behaviour. In the same sense that de classical equation we use to describe an object, for example, in free fall \u2014s(t) = s0 + v0t + (gt^2)/2\u2014 doesn&#39;t intent to say anything about the nature of the object falling, it just tells us about its movement. In this sense, taking the example of the double slit, I think it&#39;s incorrect to say that, according to the Copenhagen Interpretation, the electron &quot;is&quot; a superposition of two states: the electron passing by Slit 1 and the electron passing by Slit 2. Instead, what the Copenhagen Interpretation says is that the best description, the most knowledge, we can have of the movement of the electron, not of the electron itself, is that it has a certain probability of passing by each slit and landing at certain spots in the screen. Extending this idea to the famous cases of setting setting detectors on the slits to find out by which one it passes through \u2014or what happens to the probability wave after it hits the screen\u2014 is not different in essence from a simple conditional probability problem, isn&#39;t it? Once with limit the probability outcomes with a condition \u2014knowing where the electron has been\u2014 the final probably changes. By detecting the electron we change out knowledge of the system and the system itself. Our knowledge/description/wave-function changes, because now we know where the electron is. While the system/experiment changes, because to detect the electron we had to interact with it, thus altering its movement, hence it&#39;s not anymore a double slit experiment. But that again doesn&#39;t say anything about the nature of the electron, only about our description about its movement. What collapses with the wave function is not the electron itself, but our knowledge. So, in my view, the Pilot Wave Visualisation does not contradict the Copenhagen Interpretation, on the contrary, adds to it something it lacks: valuable insight on what the electron may actually be.", "comment_date": "2016-11-08T21:19:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Hoefer", "comment_text": "Did I miss it or did you neglect to mention that when the proton in the double-slit experiment is observed, it acts as a particle and not a wave?", "comment_date": "2016-11-08T20:59:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfonso J.

Despite me knowing the biology of humans, it is still random (btw this excludes the fact that humans have a conscious)i am only guessing based on wt i studied.

The problem with the Pilot Wave view is that it singles out one of those versions as the only real one and demotes all the others to be constituents of the background pilot wave. In this, it is somewhat reminiscent to me of the Tyco Brahe&#39;s hybrid model of the solar system where all planets, except Earth, revolved around the sun while the Earth was somehow singled out and the sun and its orbiting planets revolving around it. Such hybrids are generally bad explanations their special singling out is ultimately a form of bias. This bias creates defects in their explanatory power. In the case of the pilot wave, it confines it to working on a specific basis all the time, has trouble incorporating spin, and is forced to accommodate for non-local effects. Even worse, the way the &#39;wave&#39; interacts is very specific. It always interacts &quot;as if&quot; it was made by other versions of that particle subject to its particular setup. For example, if you put a barrier on one of the paths in the interference experiment, it effects the outcome only if the barrier is opaque to the passage of the particle. If it is transparent, it doesn&#39;t effect it at all. A general non-local spread out wave piloting  shouldn&#39;t be so specific and idiosyncratic in how it acts.This shows that the addition of  &quot;as if&quot; in the sentence above is superfluous.

I really like the pilot wave theory, or hypothesis, I don&#39;t know what it is. It makes a lot of sense, and if it emulates quantum phenomena I don&#39;t see why it shouldn&#39;t be researched more seriously.<br>Having said that, could you please clarify some questions about Quantum Mechanics? I think there is a lot of misinformation thanks to our friends the New Agers and their pseudoscience. What claims they make are Not true, what are true? For example, in the double slit experiment, is it true that when you don&#39;t measure at the slits to find out where the particles went through, they create an interference pattern, but if you measure at the slits they create a solid two bands pattern? Also, have the scientists tried to replicate this experiment with other particles, protons, neutrons, etc., and if so, do they interact differently than electrons? I ask this because I&#39;ve always tended to think that the interference pattern might be caused by an electromagnetic interaction between the electron and the material at the internal surfaces of the slits, especially if the plate is made of a metalic material. But then again, if it is true that the pattern changes depending on where and how you measure at the slits, this throws my logic through the window and I&#39;m back to square one. Uuunnnnllleeessssss......if the particle might be suffering some kind of polarization or alteration when measured that can change it&#39;s behavior, maybe measuring somehow annihilates the Pilot Wave....and the particke travels in a straight line because there is nothing to deviate it anymore...<br>I&#39;m no expert in particles nor charges, not even a rookie, but I would think that the negatively charged electron might be a lot more susceptible to interactions at a distance with other materials than a neutron would. <br>I would appreciate very much your opinion in these matters in case you find some time in your schedule to give a bit of thought and respond.

The droplet experiment may not always produce this phenomena fully. To understand why, and the origins of this phenomena (and the origins of existence!), you need to understand that energy is essentially a flow (or potential flow) going between potentials. For example, from high to low voltage, or from north to south pole, or simply from point A to point B. There are always at-least two opposing potentials when you have energy. The most fundamental potential in existence are that of KNOW, and NOT-KNOW. Energy and all of existence was produced by a life source(s), and life basically operates on KNOW and NOT-KNOW. To keep the waves going through both slits so as to keep the interference pattern, it is essential to maintain both parts of that potential (KNOW and NOT-KNOW) going though both slits. To observe which slit the particle goes through will eliminate the potential by getting rid of all the NOT-KNOW, thus the eliminating the interference pattern.<br><br>This cancellation isn&#39;t as pronounced in the droplet experiment because the droplet itself contains a massive density of KNOW/NOT KNOW within itself.

I freaking love it! Years ago in Junior High School I had some email correspondence with Michio Kaku about my &quot;crackpot theories&quot; which I&#39;m quite sure I didn&#39;t explain very well through the emails but the basic idea was taking the fundamental &quot;shapes&quot; of things and expanding them into higher dimensions, things like electrons.  To make a long story short I was attempting to solve the apparent paradox that photons can travel without a medium by attempting to explain that the &quot;shape&quot; a &quot;wave&quot; makes for us would look very different in higher dimensions and that much of the mysteries of our current understanding simply fall away when you expand into higher dimensions because we are only seeing the &quot;shadows&quot; of higher dimensional &quot;shapes.&quot;  There is a lot more to it, of course, but seeing this visually has brought my mind back to that idea for the first time in 16 years.<br><br>Now that I have the language and the understanding of exactly what I was trying to explain in our 3 dimensions, a sphere (a 3d) object moving through time interacting with a surface (a 2d) object and forcing that surface into a higher dimension by moving it up and down in a standing wave, and even imparting simple higher mechanics like those you explain at the very end of the video, now it&#39;s not much of a stretch to imagine a photon as a 5d object which creates a 3d shadow by bouncing along a 4d surface in the same way, just with another dimension to travel in. Bang, everything makes sense.<br><br>Just quick armchair-theory with this idea resolves gravity on both macro and quantum scales while reconciling them as well.  It explains how light can travel through outer space without a medium. It explains both dark energy and dark matter.

I researched this viewpoint and understanding the measurement problem theoretically during my undergraduate years; I don&#39;t consider any of them to be (completely) true anymore, but it enlightened me on what the problem was and the stigma associated with it. Quantum physicists look at the measurement problem, i.e. how we see particles during measurements when we treat them like abstract collections of states beforehand, like the big philosophical elephant in the room. If you question it, many professors - some in the department I was in last year - say boldly that only the Copenhagen school is the only correct one. The Copenhagen viewpoint and this competing &quot;pilot-wave&quot; theory as it&#39;s called, that was originally by de Broglie and precisely formulated by David Bohm and Basil Hiley a few decades later, have been fighting for a while now. In fact, they and even the multiple universes or many worlds interpretations are nothing but philosophies attached to the same theory of physics. <br><br>In reality, quantum mechanics says nothing about &quot;wave-function collapse&quot; or multiple universes; it doesn&#39;t even say electrons can be in two places at once. Instead, as a mathematicians, we view quantum mechanics as an algorithm, a mathematical structure, for generating probability distributions for the possible behaviors a physical system can undertake in time. It is well-known that some purely mathematically equivalent reformulations exist, and of course we have these physical reformulations which are mathematically extremely similar but where the symbols have different meanings, still giving the same observational results (not all the time, but most aim to do this, and scores of physicists have debated if certain interpretations really do satisfy this criterion of being observationally indistinguishable from Copenhagen models). But nobody really knows how an electron gets from one point to another, and after using quantum mechanics formally for a century, that&#39;s an astounding fact. <br><br>Sean Carroll on his blog called a survey where physicists mainly disagreed on their interpretations &quot;the most embarrassing graph in modern physics.&quot; So, it is important to distinguish several things: quantum mechanics works well without interpretations, including Copenhagen views, yet those interpretations could be right or wrong and influence research in, say, quantum gravity, and so they are just as important.

And these are also much like solitons, similar behavior in bouncing sand, worth a search.<br><br>Anyway, the thing Bjerknes didn&#39;t touch on that I know of, is the idea that spacetime is a structure of acoustic standing waves to which matter waves, solitons, spherical standing waves in the least complicated geometry (electron) are coupled.  You can work out various different geometries for vibrations in an aether, as long as you also include spacetime.<br><br>If you do, however, you run into (sooner or later in your ponderings) a huge brick wall.

Thus, in essence, you are forced to ponder that space flows out of stars, out of Type Ia supernovae, out of galaxies and so on, not to mention, out of nuclear explosions.  You are also forced to adopt that aether, or the stuff out of which space is created, flows into the neutrons that form when a type II supernova iron core implodes to produce a neutron star.  The space around the core must also flow inward in enormous quantities.<br><br>And that of course results that the inward flow of space itself, might account for the formation of a black hole.

The reason why the Copenhagen interpretation exists is rooted in the old apparent contradiction that light is both a wave (Maxwell and many others) and that is made of particles (Einstein and the photoelectric effect). The consensus at the time was that, since a physical object cannot be both a wave and a particle simultaneously, there has to be a mechanism somewhere that changes the nature of the object at some point in time.

The analog with pilot waves would be if, when you switch on the camera to observe through which slit the oil bead is traveling, the standing waves instantly disappear, and the bead then travels along the surface in a straight line. When you switch the camera back off, the waves reappear, and the beads begin to interfere with one another again, even though fired one at a time. The electrons behave as though they know when they are being observed, and then act as particles, and instead act as waves when they are not observed.

If the nature of the universe really is to reach equilibrium, then determinism would certainly come into play, as it is a factor in all of matter. Whereas the force of gravity would be a relation of the attraction of matter, it would also be the accumulation of deterministic energy. If the deterministic energy gathers, that could mean that it is pulled out of space, moving it from a deterministic space-time to a non-deterministic space, thus the splitting of the universe into infinities and &quot;anti-infinities&quot;. Due to the nature of deterministic energy to attract to itself, energy via wavelength would be essentially pulled out of less deterministic space-time into more deterministic space time to eventually join with deterministic systems. This would continue until either the eventual accumulation of matter into a black-hole, or the day of deterministic systems into fundamental particles that have similar wavelength. Either way, the result is an &quot;infinite&quot; amount of deterministic energy defined only by its position in a temporary space-time. Though At that point space and time would not exist because of the lack of relativity, and therefore even minute systems would become infinities trapped in a &quot;non-vacuum&quot; of non-deterministic space. Thus the nature of the universe would be that of an infinity, simultaneously &quot;expanding and contracting&quot; to form many other infinite universes, each of with has an equal probability of being entirely entangled with any other infinity. Quantum entanglement could then be seen as the true representation of the universe, and space and time just a brief byproduct of an infinite universe attempting to form an infinite number of entangled universes. This could also help define the &quot;fabric of space-time&quot; as the fields of deterministic energy. Therefore the gravitational waves discovered recently would not be a ripple in the &quot;fabric of space-time&quot;, but rather a wave created by the collapsing wavelengths of two extremely large deterministic bodies, moving through the energy fields of deterministic space.", "comment_date": "2016-11-03T03:39:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Novus Nihilum", "comment_text": "What is the medium upon which quantum particles are bouncing?", "comment_date": "2016-11-03T03:36:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiden G", "comment_text": "#42 on trending!", "comment_date": "2016-11-03T03:35:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Musclebrain Smartypants", "comment_text": "Space is filled with the waves of quantum particles and sometimes they result in a rouge wave that is able to break through the energy barrier that is required for the particle to exist.

But it seems to me that like this analogy, the key is a coupling between waves and a packet of mass inertia and since resonance seems fundamental I&#39;d say it stands to reason that both the particle mass is a result of a hidden resonance as is the EM to G coupling. That the arbitrary masses of known particles must be from a hidden dynamic that makes the picture vastly more messy than we currently know but also vastly more potent in expression. No doubt allowing artificial gravity and designer properties. Hand in hand with the uncomfortable erosion of what has seemed like given static physics to us.<br>It further seems to me that physics is somehow able to form a particle manifesting resonance as if in a cavity with boundaries that we don&#39;t see.

For example, if someone blows an &#39;o&#39; using smoke or vapor what they are really doing is simply pushing air directionally out of their mouth with smoke surrounding. So then why would this create a turning ring of smoke around the edge? It looks as though it is creating a field, not dissimilar from a magnetic field. This requires some knowledge of the relationship between what is referred to here as &quot;pilot waves&quot; and fields. Pilot waves are another way of understanding field lines, they are one in the same. When the original slit experiment was done it was done with photons, which if you didn&#39;t know, are propelled through space by magnetic and electric fields oscillating parallel to one another. This explanation is a bit misleading, in that electric fields are what produce magnetic fields, and that magnetic fields are nothing but the interaction between electric fields when you account for relativity. The point is that water droplets are behaving the same way things controlled by magnetic fields are. What I&#39;m suggesting is that all force produces fields, whether it is the force of a water droplet oscillating on a surface, the force of a stream of air coming out of a mouth, or a strange higher dimensional force we can barely visualize let alone understand. We classify forces by their general relative outcome, however this may be a limited way to look at the world.

I may not be a theoretical physicist, but I have a hypothesis that the day we master quantum mechanics would be the same day we start plugging in the timing and the frequency of the base-universe&#39;s vibrations relative to not seconds or arbitrary time measurement unit X, but instead when we start plugging in the universe&#39;s/machine&#39;s date of activation on to the present/instant or snapshot of time the calculations are supposedly to be taking place. further more I think the universe&#39;s base vibration&#39;s are lessoning over time (not to confuse with how it&#39;s base frequency also oscillates) which is why this starting point relative to the timing is important. The base vibration is being exposed to entropy there for effecting the same particle&#39;s consistent properties over time on top of how the base frequency&#39;s base oscillations are also having an dramatic effect as well. Its like plucking a string. It vibrates, but it eventually comes to a stop when it runs out of energy. Once we factor all of that (easier said than done), I think we should be golden.

Combining the standard Copenhagen interpretation with relativity theory gives standard quantum field theory. However the pilot-wave interpretation is much harder to reconcile with relativity theory, and I&#39;m not sure that a satisfactory relativistic theory/interpretation has been developed yet.  <br>The most prominent problem is the following: the pilot-wave theory is non-local. Each particle is &#39;guided&#39; by a pilot-wave. But this pilot-wave depends simultaneously on all the particles in the universe. This means that if we have an electron, its velocity is dependent instantaneously on the position of every other electron in the entire universe, no matter how far away they are to our electron. This is what is means for the theory to be non-local, and it seems to violate the &#39;speed limit&#39; enforced by relativity theory. <br><br>As an alternative to standard quantum mechanics, however, it boggles me that it is not even as far as mentioned in undergraduate physics courses. Clearly as a theory of quantum mechanics it makes the exact same predictions as the Copenhagen picture, yet provides a deterministic theory. It is always taught that quantum mechanics is so weird because it is non-deterministic, and particles can be in multiple places at the same time. Yet, here we have a theory which makes the same predictions as the Copenhagen theory, without all the fussyness of non-determinism! I am not saying that Bohmian mechanics is better than the Copenhagen interpretation (or vice versa), but I just think it&#39;s weird that it is never even mentioned in quantum mechanics courses.

But have some problems with the whole competing theories thing. I think that in many ways this is very easily compatible with Bohr&#39;s thoughts on how the experiments they knew about at the time probably couldn&#39;t be properly explained within the boundaries of the experiments themselves. The biggest &quot;disagreement&quot; between the Einstein&#39;s and Bohr&#39;s views at least were that quantum mechanics could be measured indirectly in the way we measure normal physics, after all. That&#39;s what they focus on for the most part, the idea that the measuring interferes with the experiment. If you read some of the papers they wrote on how to measure positions and so on it looks more like Bohr was just skeptical about the way the results were explained as general, with a fairly reasonable view that if you somehow determined the position of an electron to a single point, then it already would behave like a particle - more than that they were imagining that electromagnetic waves were both waves and particles specifically at the same time, just to mess with the equations, or something like that. Bohr turns pretty sarcastic at times when it comes to the mathematical proof, but generally just condones the research effort. Very soft criticism all round, really. Most of the ire comes from positivists who simply mock critics who subscribe to a more off-handed approach ala Kuhn: we might find something else later that supplants all the experimental data output and all the theories explicitly built on it, so don&#39;t get too arrogant, etc.<br><br>So I&#39;m not sure that the Copenhagen interpretation, at least from what Bohr suggested, is incompatible with the pilot wave thing. Really, the whole quantum field idea and the pilot wave, that both insist on that what we&#39;re measuring really is an energy bump that resonates in everything around it (with mechanics taking place in between that we simply can&#39;t map properly) seems very compatible with the ideas Bohr had at the time on what exactly &quot;quantum mechanics&quot;, as seen from the experiments known then (that really has been pretty much the same until fairly recently) really was.<br><br>Anyway - really good explanation.

Note that &quot;gravity&quot; is the directional component of the photon and that the pulsating photon is the pure energy unit in this universe.<br><br>My Current TOE:<br><br>THE SETUP:<br>1. Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.<br>2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it&#39;s the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too).<br>3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.<br>4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.<br>5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.<br><br>FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:<br>6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.<br>7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron&#39;s moving magnetic field.<br>8. There are probably no such thing as &quot;gluons&quot; in actual reality.<br>9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.<br>10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.<br>11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.<br>12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.<br><br>THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:<br>13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is &quot;gravity&quot;.<br>14. I also believe that a pulsating singularity (which is basically a pulsating photon) is the pure energy unit.<br>15. When these pulsating pure energy units interact with other pure energy units, they tangle together. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.<br>16. When the pure energy units unite together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.<br>17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.<br>18. Everything is basically &quot;light&quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with &quot;light&quot; (photons).<br><br>THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:<br>19. When the electron with it&#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.<br>20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.<br>21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.<br><br>NOTES:<br>22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.<br>25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the pure energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.<br>26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting pure energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>27.

QM is famous for its unintuitive ideas and strange take on topics like superposition and entanglement. Anyways, if this droplet experiment does replicate so many of our observations, we ought to take it seriously. Very seriously. Especially because scientists have been puzzled by the oddities of QM since a long time and many have longed an alternative theory and a macroscopic phenomenon so similar is a ideal way to test it. All i am saying is that these observations more closely replicate our findings than anything else before. So this is far more likely to represent the truth than an abstract purely theoretical idea (QM) to explain our observations.
