He used wires of silver, gold and platinum hooked to metal masses raised upwards. He also lifted weight with a heavy triple sirens flywheel machine with tones in ratio. Keely got the earth low frequency from Tesla. Tesla didn&#39;t like keely since keely received more investors money than he did.

Analysis of various apparently disconnected events where levitation was witnessed provides some important clues to a means of effecting synchronization of the nuclei. This was explained, in detail, in a paper by Davidson and Decker 6 . Also, T. Towsend Brown was quite open in publicizing his experimental results even though they were being funded in part by the Office of Naval Research out of San Diego. However, when he started rotating his gravitors on their axis the results suddenly became classified and all information on his experiments ceased. It is suspected that major levitation resulted and this breakthrough was classified to protect the discovery so it could be exploited for national defense.", "comment_date": "2022-09-20T00:46:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "buttafan", "comment_text": "We&#39;re not being told everything ... in class.

This has nothing to do with the conventional centrifugal force which is radial to the wheel. The   masses on the lower half of the wheel  have  centrifugal force moving  out of the lower half wheel and so the wheel is torqued against the falling weight,  If one plots the motion of one particle moving along with the wheel, one can see these other two centrifugal forces almost parallel with the shaft acting on the upper  and lower face.

I don&#39;t know. Have to think about it a bit more.

When the wheel is allowed to drop vertically,  the spinning sets in a horizontal velocity component on the shaft to cause it to rotate almost horizontally around the central person. This, in turn, causes the one-way spinning particles on the upper half to have a different velocity ( in magnitude and direction)  from those on the lower half, hence the original flat accelerations will become three dimensional, where the three-dimensional accelerations on the upper half of the spinning wheel will produce a force inwards towards the man in the centre and the three-dimensional accelerations on the lower half will produce a force outward from the man in the centre.  The inward forces on the upper half and the outward forces on the lower half of the spinning and translating wheel working in cooperation with the length of the shaft will produce torques to balance out the dropping weight of the &quot; three-dimensionally&quot; spinning, translating wheel. where each spin is not in a flat plane as when the wheel is held and not dropping.", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T19:28:50Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Raja Kunal Pandit", "comment_text": "Torque ka chakkar babu bhaiya Torque ka Chakkar!", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T14:33:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "kenonerboy", "comment_text": "You are no longer allowed to touch any sharpening filters.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T17:49:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Nish", "comment_text": "..and that&#39;s how I made my flying saucer motor.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T17:02:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jagdish", "comment_text": "Gr8", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T04:48:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jamie marsden", "comment_text": "offset force* physics 101 lol :)", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T02:49:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "angrysheepdog", "comment_text": "The forward progression translates the downward vertical gravitational force(s) into rotational force(s), yet not escaping, illustrated by the reduction in the holder&#39;s upward vertical effort level, yet the overall downward vertical force measured by the scale remains the same.

And the total weight of you and the wheel doesn&#39;t change, when you are raising it, because of this energy being spent by the wheel. If it was not turning and you would just raise the wheel (maybe with two arms, to make it easier for you) you would actually be a lot heavier during all the time you are raising it, since as you push it up, you are pushed down by the wheel. The fact that you don&#39;t weight a lot more while you are raising it is the proof that there is another energy being spent to raise the wheel.

Have a look to what happen with the gyroscopic effect in ORBIT (space station ) there is NO MORE PRECESSION. because the weight force has disappeared from the mechanical  system (only the inertial effect remain).", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T14:57:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "musicas de teclado", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDJwqed09K8,\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDJwqed09K8,</a>.", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T03:38:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jhon Seller", "comment_text": "Seems like Thor studied physics first in order to handle his hammer", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T14:02:06Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Hassaan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo&amp;t=3m55s\">3:55</a> it had the energy of a romantic scene between a physicist and a spinning wheel", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T12:43:35Z", "likes_count": 55}, {"comment_by": "Martin Halvax", "comment_text": "Did he just pull a painter in front of the camera cause he looked strong enough to make us believe the wheel is heavy? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T02:46:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Everything 10", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP26gClvTXz8NKqssBao0mA\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP26gClvTXz8NKqssBao0mA</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T07:03:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crazy Content TV  (CCTV)", "comment_text": "you can view this video of anti gravitic cars.<br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Dsa0nXXeHqA\">https://youtu.be/Dsa0nXXeHqA</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T03:15:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "manoj sharma", "comment_text": "It is equal", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T03:07:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jewels Martin", "comment_text": "If add this pre 1950 u would be assassinated", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T23:37:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vishal .S", "comment_text": "vhfjgukyo", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T17:51:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Social status", "comment_text": "Your weight become <br> Your Actual weight(N) + 19/12N = weight of system <br><br>Here, <br>System refers to object and sir.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T17:33:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lisa DeRuby", "comment_text": "The difficult saw continuously intend because goose jekely injure lest a woozy mirror. complete, giant equinox", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T19:50:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nissar Rm", "comment_text": "CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T09:49:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "YOMAULYDYN GO", "comment_text": "Desember 2020 like and dislike \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2020-12-04T22:18:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Theo Kremer", "comment_text": "The subsequent secure endogenously drown because fertilizer hooghly race a a drunk crayfish. tremendous, wiry viscose", "comment_date": "2020-12-04T20:52:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Druelo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo&amp;t=2m27s\">2:27</a> Too much talking, rpm drops.", "comment_date": "2020-12-04T17:55:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LinuX Man", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a> god moment.", "comment_date": "2020-12-04T16:22:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zhuo Liu", "comment_text": "Isn\u2019t it obvious?

Later I will give my own version of what is precession, but lets, for now, assume that people know what &quot;precession&quot; means.<br>Consider the wheel in the video which is spinning clockwise with respect to the drill, and looking plan view, then the extension arm is rotating clockwise. <br><br>1. As the spinning wheel is released, the weight of the wheel drops down with the hand being held at the same level. This will tilt the spinning wheel about a horizontal diameter. THIS DROP WILL CAUSE THE FIRST PRECESSION ACTION in a horizontal manner<br>2. During the drop/hence wheel tilt, considering the two spinning mass particles on the vertical diameter of the spinning wheel,   the upper mass accelerates out while the lower mass accelerates in with respect to the pivot support arm. This acceleration results in the spinning wheel reorienting its spinning plane by 90 degrees, such that the hand tends to be shifted clockwise horizontally with respect to the spinning wheel. Since the hand is fixed, it is the spinning wheel that takes this horizontal reaction and accelerates to move clockwise to gain an angular velocity a little more than Wp, precession horizontal angular velocity of the extended arm.<br>3. As the horizontal extended arm accelerates fast and reaches a little more than Wp ( the natural precession rate) then the masses at the end of a  horizontal diameter of the spinning wheel will accelerate in and out, and so 90 degrees later the spinning wheel reorientates itself such that it will apply a heavy vertical load on the supporting hand.  This will take the added load reaction to lift the wheel up to the original level before it dropped down in the first place. THIS IS A SECOND PRECESSION EFFECT EXACTLY AS THE  FIRST ONE  but oriented at 90  degrees with it. Two added 90 degrees equal 180-degree rotation and so the original drop action, after two precessions, will become a lifting action.<br>4. Lifting the wheel to its original level will slow down the precession angular velocity below Wp and so the lifting will stop and the spinning wheel will then drop again to repeat the action. It may be regarded as a high-speed oscillatory action between a vertical drop in potential energy, with the wheel gaining a horizontal angular velocity around the pivot, then this Kinetic energy is used to lift up the total weight of the spinning mass to the original level.   All done through two lossless precession actions,  first one horizontally and the second one vertically up.  The high-speed rate at which this takes place may be looked at being a continuous action, except in a nutation process. <br><br>The definition of precession. Take one case. When the spinning masses of a gyro wheel are also rotated around in a circle on an extended arm, (as in the video) then the followed trajectory of one spinning mass particle acting on the wheel, is a three dimensional (nonflat) cycloidal path which causes the creation of different &quot; arching&quot; accelerations at different locations, hence the creation OF TWO varying CENTRIFUGAL FORCES,  one acting in an inbound direction on the upper half of the spinning wheel, and the other in an outbound direction acting on the lower half of the spinning wheel. These two equal centrifugal forces cause a  vertical torque to tilt the plane of the spinning wheel where this resulting vertical torque will change the orientation of the spinning plane by 90 degrees.   Note that in this case since the two opposite acting centrifugal forces acting on the upper and lower halves of the spinning wheel are equal, then the experiment shown in the video will result that there is no resulting centrifugal force on that spinning and continuously precessing wheel around an extended arm. <br>If an extension arm is not used, but the gyro is torqued, a similar reaction will follow.   <br><br>So, a torqued gyro spinning wheel will produce two equal opposite varying centrifugal forces, acting on different halves of the plane of a spinning wheel to produce a reorientation at 90 degrees to the original torque action.", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T09:30:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BADAR ALI", "comment_text": "So this is the trick Thor used in his hammer.

It is spacetime (ST) contraction caused by the SPEED of mass. Fundamentally it works opposite to the vector of movement of fast objects, or (in case of a spinning object) orthogonal to the plain of spin. A gyroscope suspended in weightless space best illustrates this:<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/xQb-N486mA4\">https://youtu.be/xQb-N486mA4</a>.       In this video, by holding the spinning wheel on one end, earth&#39;s gravity is trying to change the wheel&#39;s axis but the gravity wheel&#39;s &#39;artificial&#39; directional gravity opposes this change of direction, just like the gyroscope in space does. What&#39;s there not to understand? What about restmass you may ask? same thing!. Here we have subatomic particles spiraling around the nuclei of atoms, producing similar directional orthogonal ST  mini contractions. It is only because all orbits are and atom are utterly unaligned that the collective contraction (Restmass gravity) APPEARS to work radial. Einstein&#39;s GR thus is not fundamental, but just a mathematical approximation of how atoms collectively contract ST.

It will be difficult to pick it up with one hand or lift it above your head, but if you start spinning it with yourself (just like Olympic ball throwers ) eventually you will notice that the heavy ends starts to raise up and it becomes very easy to hold it up or keep it up. Instead of having difficulty of raising it, now you have to hold on to it so it doesn&#39;t fly away you. I feel like gyros work on the same concept, because if you try to pick up spinning 50 lbs gyro but you remain stationery and you don&#39;t spin it around yourself, you will feel exact same weight as just trying to pick up non spinning gyro.", "comment_date": "2020-02-23T21:24:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siddharth tech guide", "comment_text": "And try opposite direction", "comment_date": "2020-02-23T05:17:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iris Cruccas", "comment_text": "Thor\u2019s hammer", "comment_date": "2020-02-22T19:58:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PickleYoda", "comment_text": "THOR", "comment_date": "2020-02-22T16:36:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bill Green", "comment_text": "less then        yep teslas free energy antigravity space ships", "comment_date": "2020-02-21T05:40:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EmeraldView", "comment_text": "That slo-mo part brought tears to me eye.<br><br>You go Derek.... you go...  <br><br>\ud83d\ude04", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T16:26:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dexter Mamingao", "comment_text": "Matter", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T15:06:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AkuJom TV", "comment_text": "that anti gravity wheel is an actor", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T02:53:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Expertname98", "comment_text": "This is fake, the gravity was a paid actor", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T02:01:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cameron Reed", "comment_text": "Lies, gravity was a paid actor", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T01:13:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Flietas", "comment_text": "Si lo pusieras en una balanza , cuanto pesar\u00eda girando a las m\u00e1ximas revoluciones ?????", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T23:05:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mandakhbayar .M", "comment_text": "Is it going to explode your hands if you actually touch the spinning disk???", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T14:28:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mandakhbayar .M", "comment_text": "Science has joined the chat<br><br><br>GRAVITY HAS LEFT THE CHAT", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T14:27:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mandakhbayar .M", "comment_text": "Gravity : hey whats up guys<br><br>Science : NO", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T14:26:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don Tanton", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taj4VA1L_vw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taj4VA1L_vw</a>", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T14:01:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrik Lindholm", "comment_text": "Of course not.", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T08:55:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kruuger", "comment_text": "So this is why UFOs are round", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T02:10:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sander Vanspauwen", "comment_text": "the music makes it feel like it&#39;s a new wonder of this world lol", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T21:57:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "\u0411\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044c, \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u044e \u0442\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0442. \u0410 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T09:02:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Imacookieboi Choc chip", "comment_text": "Forbidden lollipop", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T20:54:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Dominiak", "comment_text": "You should have spun two wheels on that one stick to about a thousand rpm and just watch it ride away", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T20:44:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Cox", "comment_text": "He just got SO much stronger", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T20:01:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Omniscient", "comment_text": "Mby thats fhy UFOs are shaped like that and sometimes pictured spinning", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T01:24:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Boo Boo", "comment_text": "Rotation provides stability in that plane.

This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy! Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent WITH/AS what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !!! It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Carefully consider what is THE MAN who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA ON BALANCE !!! (Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE.) Objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA ON BALANCE !!! ACCORDINGLY, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !!! Carefully consider what is THE EYE. GREAT. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. TIME DILATION ultimately proves ON BALANCE that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Again, gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.

I believe it is time for all believers to come together and start to work to build a ship to leave earth. I guess it sounds like science fiction, well since 1980 I have tried to find the words to say this without sounding crazy but there are none! so I have to say this best that I know how. I can tell you this, this ship is more like a seed and just like other life forms the earth should have the ability to reproduce and keep all the life forms alive, that\u2019s where we come in. All the believers in God And Jesus were born with a piece of this knowledge to make this happen! I believe that not only can we make a ship that can travel though space and time but to find a planet like earth and make an environment like we have here on earth. This is not a joke! people have died because they had knowledge that scared the people in power. I am just a man who believes in God and jesus and I believe I have a piece of this knowledge,I think that all the technology that we believe we have Invented was put here for us to find and to point us in this direction. This is the same instinct that animals Have to migrate on earth like birds and fish except we would migrate into space. I would like to know how many people think this, especial master mechanics and at this time in the Human history we have the knowledge and ability to do all most anything so before we lose or use all the earth\u2019s resources\u2019 up! We should try to do this,And this should be the goal of the human race! PART 2 this is not a joke to those who believe in god and Jesus, To put an end to the dependency on oil would mean to produce an energy supply that is inexhaustible and that would be perpetual Electric Motor Force! This would change who has the power or those who control the world, To produce free energy would also cause problems with over population food, water, land all these things would become in short supply! that\u2019s why those who are in power cause wars, So that they can stay in power! Because they don\u2019t know what to do to fix the problems that Technologies Create and they want to stay in power so they start a war\u2019s by giving weapons or knowledge that is above the ability of those they want to control or destroy! Science is the art of finding a truth as long as it is politely correct don\u2019t mention God or intellectual design or you might find a truth you don\u2019t want! If you are a scientist, you might find yourself out of a job! Or like Galileo you could find yourself in jail! The truth is its own language, and has a power that can change everything! and that is why all governments want to control knowledge and religion and tell all people what to think and believe! ha science it\u2019s nice to have something that\u2019s sounds good and that makes sense even though it might just be a little piece of a truth for a Short period Of time that misleads. it\u2019s very difficult to tell a story knowing that the words you write could change people\u2019s lives, knowing that mere words can make people think get people angry! It reminds me of the time when I was working with a few guys and one guy said you believe in aliens and I said yes and he said are you crazy? and I said let me ask you a question, I said where do you live and he said New Jersey, and I said where is New Jersey and he replied The United States and I said where\u2019is the United States? and he didn\u2019t Have an answer, and I said is it in the northern hemisphere of Earth? and he said yes. And I said where is Earth and he said he didn\u2019t know, I said isn\u2019t Earth in space? isn\u2019t Earth\u2019s part of the Milky Way constellation and he said yes, and I said so you live on A planet in the Milky Way constellation in outer space so doesn\u2019t that mean there\u2019s life in space? and he was in shock! and said I don\u2019t want to think about this get away from me, and I said to him if you live on a planet in outer space do you think we are the only ones? and i said what do you know of that there\u2019s only one of, and he said I don\u2019t know, but he was scared to think these things there are many things in life as profound as that, we just need to stop and think what are we here for? why are we here? why are we able to invent and create? If we were able to travel through space to colonize another planet that was void and without life, we would have to make it exactly like Earth! everything here was put here for a reason, everything! things we like things we don\u2019t like things we understand and the things we don\u2019t understand, Everything is here on earth needs to be here for us to survive all the life forms the environment climate all these things were designed as if you were putting a fish tank in your house and you have to put everything in the fish tank that the fish needs or they would not live! We are no different, something someone created and made all this happen! everything is too complex but yet perfect, IF we were on a spaceship stranded in space and we came to this planet this would be like heaven! This would be an island oasis but like all life forms they live they die our planet is no different, and just think that the knowledge program into our DNA is telling us these things! that\u2019s why the technology we think we are inventing is being discovered, not invented! I know that people like Galileo and Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin had information that most people could never understand! There are others like Nikola Tesla, Thomas Townsend Brown Paul Benfield that few will be able to understand. I always wondered if it stated anything in the holy Bible about another earth, if this was the only earth that God had created, and then I found revelations Chapter 21.

Some of the energy that the drill puts into the spin is released on one of the axis of momentum to create the upward force.  Look up the  facts on what the Russians discovered and hid, where they took the wingnuts off the spacecraft, and once the offset switched sides, and the centrifugal force started pulling it enough it switches directions.  Then it relaxes, rinse and repeat.  Id be willing to bet you can go only so far (up or whever) until you felt the switch, where it will stop pulling  Then i imagine it will reverse to some other axis, then return back.  <br><br>Thanks for the cool demo.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T05:17:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frost pumps", "comment_text": "I think it will be =", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T03:46:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aki", "comment_text": "Could this affect science on aircraft engineering?", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T02:39:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Dell", "comment_text": "Prolly how ufos work", "comment_date": "2019-09-28T16:25:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Useful Eater", "comment_text": "Now you have to make a saucer that you can fly in", "comment_date": "2019-09-28T16:06:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0440\u044f\u043f\u0447\u0435\u0432", "comment_text": "\u0410 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442 \u0425\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0438  )))", "comment_date": "2019-09-28T15:42:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loudmouth", "comment_text": "Can it be spun so fast that the wheel spinning causes the whole object to have less mass?

Individually, the angular and linear momentum are NOT conserved separately. This is a mistake in physics. The SUM of angular and linear momentum IS conserved, however, AND this correction to (or clarification of) Newton&#39;s Rule by Laithwaite allows for the conversion of one into the other. <br>     In your experiment, just as in Laithwaite&#39;s experiment, the gyro was easier to lift while it was spinning, even though the weight didn&#39;t change. If your scale had a platform which could rotate as you stand on it, you would find that the gyro naturally wants to precess and your whole body would precess with it. This represents the almost complete conversion of the downward component of its initial fall into MORE angular momentum. When you lift it, the gyro rotor dips even more downward causing an increase in the processional angular momentum.  Thus, the SUM of the two types of momentum (linear and angular) is conserved, even though one got smaller and the other got larger.<br>     The reason it is easy to lift is that the upward momentum you give it with your hand is mostly converted into angular momentum. This causes the force of lifting to virtually disappear. It is a real effect. Any upward momentum you give it is going to show up in downward momentum and register as a force on the scale, or a weight increase. Physics is not perfect.

And that doesn\u2019t even address the energy needed to spin such discs fast enough to ALMOST nullify their own weight.<br><br>Just think about it. <br><br>Elementary, dear Watson.", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T21:38:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u30d9\u30ac\u300e\u1d07\u1d22\u0280\u1d00\u1d0d\u1d0f\u0274\u300f", "comment_text": "Vibrations", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T21:33:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lilpanda", "comment_text": "Some people loved this so much, they flipped the screen over and liked it again.", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T21:10:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shamans Bridge", "comment_text": "This is a replication of the experiment made by Prof. Eric Laithewaite back in the 1980&#39;s.", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T18:13:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "the unboxed", "comment_text": "So he just explained how ufo work", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T02:22:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcelo Xavier Vilas Boas", "comment_text": "Porque os engenheiros n\u00e3o enchem os interiores dos caminh\u00f5es de cargas com algumas rodas como essas e assim poderiam diminuir os excesso de peso que a gravidade exerce sobre a carga e no final isso resultaria em baixo consumo de combust\u00edvel f\u00f3ssil!!!", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T21:40:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riccardo zignani", "comment_text": "3 2 1 .... foool", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T21:20:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JasonJason210", "comment_text": "Pity you chose not to mention of Professor Eric Laithwaite, former Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering at Imperial College London, who first demonstrated this experiment, and who you&#39;ve obviously copied it off.

Why is that? Well here we go (consider this)- {Understand first where we are} We are on a planet and each one of us is rotating in a circle (planet revolves) at aprox. 1000 mph- that planet we are on is orbiting the sun (a star) at aprox. 65,000 mph That sun is taking us (on our planet) on a journey through  and around the center of the Milky way (galaxy) at some 500,000 mph and that galaxy is taking us through space at some one million miles per hour aprox. SOOOO if an object ( a craft) that can Hypothetically control gravity  or repulse gravity of create some sort of vortex around it that insulates it from gravity appears /functions in our atmosphere it will operate 100% outside of the effects of not only our gravity (earth) but the gravity of the cosmos-SOOO what does that mean? That means when who ever is on board the craft flips the 100% repel gravity switch, that craft will appear (appear = keyword) to shoot off at unbelievable speed in some direction, and if the machine (craft) moves up of down ( on  say the X, Y axis of its current position) from our perspective it will appear to make an impossible 90 degree turn  or bounce around  and do things ( from our perspective) that would flatten (ergo G force ) anyone on board the craft , but, thats not whats really happening to the craft occupants as from their perspective they are just moving slightly ,Because They are on board a machine thats creating its own force (gravity)field.And they are not moving as we see them moving.  Where as soon as the craft occupant flipped that gravity field switch on that machine from our prospective it would look like that machine shot off at 1000s of miles per hour where for the dudes on board that is not what happened in fact from their perspective the Earth would be shooting away at 1000s of miles per hour ( the opposite) - Of course at the end of the day the trick is to build a machine that nullifies gravity? ...

Lightweight&#39;s(;-) perceived difference in ease of the lift is just that (a difference in perception). The &#39;dead&#39; weight must be lifted out of balance, but the &#39;live&#39; weight can be lifted at a point, as close to his body CoG as convenient so he can lift straight up against the live load, vs out &amp; up required for the dead load.   <br>Davidowski&#39;s re-enactment would have been just as valid, and more convincing (like yours) if he had used a fish scale and an engine hoist to more closely reproduce and improve the objectivity of his predecessor&#39;s not-quite-clever-enough understanding of a clever demonstration of body mechanics. <br>Pretty well done, but you could have improved your understanding or Laithwaite&#39;s original folly if you had worked with a sports or physical therapist or someone more familiar with the bio-mechanics of this experiment, who could have better explained the surprising difference in difficulty in lifting the two systems.   I noticed in the video, that it looks easier to keep the lifting point over your feet for the &#39;live&#39; load, than the &#39;dead&#39; load, and that the &#39;live&#39; load is more stable than the &#39;dead&#39; load.  You actually take advantage of the precession by lifting it with your right hand.  I suspect it would be somewhat more difficult with your left hand, unless you reversed the spin of the weight and therefore the precession. <br>BTW1: Consistent with common sense (and a dumbbell), slightly more while you lift, the same while it is moving horizontally behind you, and slightly less while you finish the swing back down in front of you.<br>BTW2: This is related to the &#39;magic bracelet&#39; sales scam where the salesperson &#39;tests&#39; your strength without and with the magic bracelet, by pushing straight down on your extended arm without the bracelet or drink (or whatever &#39;health&#39; trash he is selling) and then slightly toward your feet with the product, making it seem you have suddenly become much stronger.", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T01:42:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WildBob", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo&amp;t=1m05s\">1:05</a> that&#39;s some Harry Potter witch craft.", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T01:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sphnx", "comment_text": "I saw this 2 years ago now im back", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T20:58:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GEBREEGZIABHER GEBRIHANS", "comment_text": "IT IS GEVERNED BY  LOW OF CONSERVATION ANGULAR MOMENTEM", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T17:04:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mihir Jha", "comment_text": "This could&#39;ve gone so wrong , final destination level wrong", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T16:11:35Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Ghost Who Walks", "comment_text": "We done this at school back in the 80s.", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T14:37:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u041f\u043e\u0442\u044a\u0440\u0430", "comment_text": "watching this stoned, wtf ?", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T12:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just Looking", "comment_text": "It will weigh briefly more as you are lifting: height is stored energy you are inputting.

Let me try to explain.<br><br>Look at this video:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo</a><br><br>The reason why it is easier to lift the gyro wile spinning is because it has no inertia. The weight of the gyro is still the same it just has no inertia when he is lifting it wile precessing. That is why it feels lighter...he does not fight against the inertia. You can see this when he is on a scale in the next video. When he lifts the gyro wile standing on a scale the needle of the scale wobbles around one weight, it only massively changes at the end when he returned the gyro down...BUT without a precession, he just put it down. That way it has inertia and it showed on the <a href=\"http://scale.it/\">scale.It</a> is on this video:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLMpdBjA2SU&amp;\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLMpdBjA2SU&amp;</a><br><br>So the reason why it feels lighter is only by the fact that the person who lifts the gyroscope doesn&#39;t fight against the inertia, it just lifts the weight. If you try to lift the gyro without precession it will feel as heavy as when it is not rotating. Are we clear on that? <br><br>Please look at my device:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3U9BH_al_A\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3U9BH_al_A</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZP_ZbnGA9I&amp;t=20s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZP_ZbnGA9I&amp;t=20s</a><br><br>This is my centrifugal (precession) propulsion drive. Here is my theory behind it. Gyroscopic precession has no moment of inertia. You can find that in relevant articles about gyroscopes, it is a science fact. This means that when you rotate my device and the arms of the device start to go forward due to precession, this movement forward of the arms has no moment of inertia, or the whole apparatus does not have opposite moment of inertia...This is very important. Now when you stop rotating the gyroscopes (motors at the end of the arms of the device) the precession stops and the centrifugal force returns the arms back. This movement BACK is not induced by precession so it has moment of inertia. This means that arms move in one direction without inertia. The trick is this movement back of the arms to be stopped by precession so it cancels the reaction (third newton law) and you have forward movement. So the movement of the arms in one direction is caused by precession and in the other direction is caused by the power of the centrifugal force, then they are stopped by precession and the cycle repeats itself. This is why the moment of inertia is unilateral. You do not brake the third Newton law. There is not a problem with the physics in it. Simply the movement forward of the arms is caused by the precession of the gyroscopes (the arms) and has no moment of inertia (does not cause reaction) and when you stop the rotation of the arms the precession stops and now this movement of the arms (caused by centrifugal force) has moment of inertia. This way when going forward, the arms of the apparatus does not have moment of inertia and when the gyroscopes are turned off and precession has stopped the centrifugal force returns them back they have a moment of inertia. That is why the whole apparatus will be moving forward. The problem with this device is however that the gyroscopes on the arms are to small and produce small precession<br><br>HOWEVER YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!<br>The most important thing is that the precession must stop with precession. What this means. Imagine you re in space, weightless and no air around you. Your arms are spread and you flap them once as a bird and stop. Will you move? No you will not. Why? Because the movement of the arms DOWN will cause opposite reaction by the Newtons law, and when you stop your arms this force will be equal and in the opposite direction so you will not move at all.<br>Now this is why the movement of the arm must be stopped by precession.<br>When you rotate the device the arms go forward due to precession and this movement is without inertia. When you stop the gyroscopes rotating action the precesson stops and the arms go back due to centrifugal force. But if you don&#39;t stop this movement by another precession (start the rotation of the arms) the force will cancel itself (same as that astronaut). But when you stop the back motion of the arms (caused by the cetrifugal force only) the inertia is cancelled by precession. In this case the astronaut an move forward. That is why you get a forward motion. <br><br>I shared all this with M Thruster on youtube. He is reluctant to communicate even though I think he can tweak his device much better. We exchanged a few emails together. Hope he will listen, I&#39;m sure he will.<br><br>Please comment and tell me if this is not a valid explanation. I think that no other device actually work except mine and the M Thruster. Above is the explanation for the principle of work.<br><br>best regards<br>kristijan", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T16:35:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio Lemos", "comment_text": "Fico pensando o q seria poss\u00edvel fazer com um conjunto de girosc\u00f3pios eletricos girando em sentidos opostos ?", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T13:07:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "waseem arbaz", "comment_text": "Fake", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T07:53:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gerald Ladera", "comment_text": "that`s simple, the mass is dropping weight in all directions, so, the gravity seems to pass through it only in a few points, not in the entire body of the object", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T00:55:41Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCEJxO6V9g\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCEJxO6V9g</a>", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T08:49:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sprint_Rocket", "comment_text": "VE<br>VO", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T04:23:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fer berasain", "comment_text": "Try forc\u00e9 not rect but parabolic", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T02:49:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glenn Dunn", "comment_text": "This might be the coolest demo I&#39;ve seen\ud83d\udc38", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T01:48:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NotAlpharius", "comment_text": "In america gravity plays you<br>In soviet union you play gravity", "comment_date": "2019-01-03T17:12:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Life Forms", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo&amp;t=3m18s\">3:18</a> This looks/feels like a 90s movie lol", "comment_date": "2019-01-03T00:09:31Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "Markjensen Coralde", "comment_text": "Use to fly a car.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T20:41:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PRABHU L K S 008", "comment_text": "Momentum", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T13:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pulesjet", "comment_text": "WTH ?

So at steady state gravity gets time so we get more weight. Due to speed of the rotation of the wheel gravity can\u2019t get normal time to travel on the spinning wheel as speed of the spinning wheel makes gravity less effective so the reason here is Force (force of gravity) Requires Time To Travel. So the wheel due to rotation is in higher time or higher speed both time or speed gravity can\u2019t catch so due to rotation as gravity can\u2019t effect completely so spinning wheel results in less weight to be lifted by the rod.<br><br>Center is opposite to time center means time holding from all directions so spinning wheel is in higher (faster) time than gravity so gravity CAN\u2019T WORK. time is different at the center like even from the surrounding of the wheel is there in more time but center `is above time opposite to time\u2019 so center is using less time for the same event which surroundings of center are there in so center is time-travelling way ahead means time-travelling like ahead so due to center which is even above time gravity can\u2019t travel. And as gravity opposite is forcetravelling which is from center too gravity doesn\u2019t work against center so makes wheel weightless from the center AS FROM THE CENTER gravity can\u2019t effect as forcetravelling is force in past and also working if anyother force is applied forcetravels works in opposite direction SO IT WORKS AGAINST GRAVITY TOO. DUE TO ROTATION OF THE WHEEL WHICH IF HAVING A CENTER time makes wheel weightless as force of the wheel can\u2019t travel on gravity due to time or forcetravelling doesn\u2019t lets gravity work as force travelling is bigger force than gravity SO GRAVITY BECOMES NEGLIBGIBLE IS THE ONE more reason that spinning wheel experience lighter in weight.<br><br>As center is in forcetravelling it is overpowering time as forcetravelling is time-achieved thing as we push object if other than center forcetravelling is in past so forcetravelling is opposite to weight too even weight can\u2019t work due forcetravelling as due to forcetravelling too gravity can\u2019t work on the object as much forcetravelling as less the weight so weight can\u2019t use forcetravelling but forcetravelling could use weight to travel longer in space means forcetravelling could use gravity (heavy objects travel longer distance in space after push [as forcetravelling results in event and the more weight the more far object goes in space after push due to forcetravelling works as fuel if is nearing to any planet the object is by using gravity) as forcetravelling is time achieving and working in higher (faster) time even in past and higher force than gravity forcetravelling is in higher time so the quality of forcetravelling takingover time is also there (to make wheel weightless due to by the force of forcetravelling working in time) and as forcetravelling is in past too (if something is in past gravity has not occurred or time haven\u2019t formed due to time no there things aren\u2019t existing but forcetravelling could contribute before gravity so objects are not massless but weightless [even mass of the object is due to forcetravelling so forcetravelling is working on all objects like spinning wheel and it {forcetravelling} is more powerful than gravity whereas time removes the effect of gravity] this square bracket I say) but the force of forcetravelling can\u2019t be denied too by gravity so gravity instead of stopping the object adds to the force of forcetravelling if checked in space so gravity works opposite (making the object travel longer) just due to forcetravelling (it is) possible.<br><br>we are able to lift a rod with spinning wheel by easier way that is due to it (the rod is) is light in weight by spinning of the wheel. So (here) first time doesn\u2019t allows gravity then force travelling overpowers gravity and then center could work easily against gravity three things are the way I see the Video so wheel lifted by rod is less in weight as the wheel was spinning due to time is the first reason as force of gravity requires time to work so as gravity can\u2019t work due to time ahead spinning wheel is and gravity can\u2019t work is also known due to center and from forcetravelling too gravity is ineffective and inreal due to time as on time gravity can\u2019t get (to work) so with spinning wheel (which attains more time) if the rod is lifted it makes us feel less weight as on time (certain speed) gravity can\u2019t work.", "comment_date": "2018-07-28T02:31:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ElvishVR", "comment_text": "The spinning wheel is rotating so force of gravity can\u2019t travel at a point  which makes spinning wheel lighter and also due to gravity requires time to travel on wheel which due to rotating of wheel gravity doesn\u2019t gets time to travel and at the wheel the force of gravity works only in time as GRAVITY REQUIRES TIME TO TRAVEL. The wheel becomes less in effect of gravity due to it (the wheel)  becomes less in time gravity can\u2019t effect as gravity requires time to travel. gravity requires time to travel which it can\u2019t get due to spinning of the wheel so the spinning wheel is less in time (as gravity can\u2019t travel due to time it can\u2019t get) while rotating so gravity can\u2019t effect wheel is found lighter which we find due to spinning alone due to spinning of the wheel it is.  So lifting of a rod is LESS IN WEIGHT DUE TO THE spinning of the wheel as gravity doesn\u2019t gets time to travel as by spinning with speed the wheel is.<br><br>There is no mass too if is spinning at light-like velocity where  friction doesn\u2019t go away but as friction is in no time-travel so at light-like velocity we are not dashed with objects one thing due to no friction and right way to overcome friction is rotors spinning from the center two thing both one and two due to light-like velocity  I mean there is no mass for time at light-like velocity due to one and two I write here  So we are weightless at light-like velocity too is one of the example like time holding from the center like due to time could travel fully on us due to time-travel, so weightless is such an example as time controlling or center controlling. AND incase of time-travel too its same like we are in Nothing or Nothing controlling we live again we are weight less.<br><br>Time could do anything due to center time is up it means there is no-center as things have center they are in time. now for time it is more easy to work with round things like wheel as time keeps travel due to centre. Time has no center and center MEANS TIME HOLDING INSTEAD OF NOTHING IN ALL DIRECTIONS  directions  sameway so due to time working on the wheel wheel experiences less weight. Here other than Nothing time is holding and making spinning wheel weight less as much time can work from the center. Time works from the center which is easy due to spinning of the wheel, for time to act and takeover I say.<br><br>Only time isn\u2019t required for the center AS TIME IS NO THERE IN THE CENTER IN CENTER ANY CHANGE HAS NOT COME while spinning the wheel if we go quantum we find center is inactive so is in no-time or in less time (center is) comparing to the surrounding center is like less in time and doing the same job like the surrounding does in more time so center is time gaining comparing to surrounding or anything else.<br><br>Time keeps forming due to center so center is less in time as time is taken-over by the center due to center time doesn\u2019t pass. Also due to center is outside time no beginning and no end so its something same as time. now job of center is time center is only there if time-travelled thing living together with us so center can also be used like time-travelling and like a property of light as light extends to the center so not only time-travel works due to center but property of light also works after center for us to know knowledge. <br><br>Time has not happened from the center as force applied from all directions IS IN PRESENT TIME DUE TO NO CAUSE AND EFFECT so spinning wheel\u2019s center is in present time too so like other job who are past (after we work) center is no past WHEN WE WORK AT IT.<br><br>Time has got the center I say so as friction due to friction alone time could halt or stop to work due to friction alone friction is opposite to center you can\u2019t put something on the center alone if it is not spinning due to friction can\u2019t work as opposite to center it is so center has not formed due to friction. SO ALONE DUE TO FRICTION TIME CAN\u2019T WORK. Other than Nothing too time could work if gets center by spinning time could be all direction working thing.<br><br>Center is opposite to time as force is put at the center. Due to center means time has not happened from the center means (time has) less happened comparing to the surroundings like other objects or comparing to borders of the wheel time has less happened from the center or comparing to the center anything else is in more time whether other objects or borders of the wheel.<br><br>Time keeps forming due to center so center is less in time. as center is outside time no beginning and no end so we can\u2019t say a wheel is past because if we say a wheel means job is done that the wheel had already become just due to center it is not in past so we see a wheel means its function too we say together so wheel is less in past and could be present as inreal the wheel only works in present. So time, center and present we know here. Due to center present time like things we could be achieved such as copy, time-travel, overcoming force or overcoming time, forcetravelling and mass too is only there if there was a center. Without center things can\u2019t come in dimensions so mass only forms if there is a center as equal force-travelling is possible only due to center for mass.<br><br>Now forcetravelling it is in past so due to forcetravelling at the thing or wheel could stay in time as center is opposite time. center means no-time as from all direction force is travelling so time doesn\u2019t gets direction to form so parts other than centre of the wheel are only in time and center is not in time due to forcetravelling. Forcetravelling is in PAST IF WE PUSH AN OBJECT GET AMOUNT OF FORCE BACK but which was already there we feel after pushing we know that the opposite force is in past so the object was made so such way forcetravelling doesn\u2019t requires time, force travelling is in past as I say here, work from the center it other than force-travelling which results in no-time as normally force-travelling is past as I say, normal force travelling too is in past so weight of the object ISN\u2019T FORCETRAVELLING BUT OPPOSITE TO FORCE-TRAVELLING And to lift the rod of spinning wheel FORCE-TRAVELS WHICH TRAVELS IN TIME AS DOESN\u2019T ALLOWS TIME TO ACT AS FORCE-TRAVELLING IS TIME-ACHIEVING THING AND NOT dependent on time.<br><br>Forcetravelling is in past but forcetravelling from all the directions is present. due to force-travelling from all directions center doesn\u2019t remain in past as force-travelling is past but force-travelling from all directions is present (like for a wheel) so we do jobs they are become past but center if works works in present as there is no way (direction) remaining to be past so past from all the directions (forcetravelling) is also present.<br><br>SO DUE TO THESE REASONS force requires time to travel, mass and friction, time is opposite to center, force-travelling is in past we are able to lift a rod with spinning wheel by easier way that is due to it is light in weight by spinning of the wheel.", "comment_date": "2018-07-27T23:00:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joker jj", "comment_text": "less than", "comment_date": "2018-07-27T20:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaik Hussain", "comment_text": "Power of mechanism", "comment_date": "2018-07-27T14:48:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaik Hussain", "comment_text": "That was awesome", "comment_date": "2018-07-27T14:47:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicolas Cacace", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve seen your other videos.

What happens to the weight of the entire system then?  Because I&#39;m thinking the weight of the system as measured by the scale will decrease under those conditions due to the fact that the spinning wheel will want to rise,   But it can&#39;t because you&#39;re using the weight of the system to hold it down.  \r<br>\r<br>Stated another way ... Here&#39;s an example of the kind of test I&#39;d like to see:  You need to be standing on a surface that can freely spin as you hold the 40 pound gyroscope. This spinning surface is placed on top of the scale so the entire weight can be measured (just as you did in the video ... except now we have the additional weight of the freely spinning surface you&#39;re standing on).  Record the weight of everything (you, the 40 pound fly wheel and connecting bar, and the freely spinning surface you&#39;re standing on ... everything that&#39;s on top of the scale).  Now rev up the 40 pound gyroscopic wheel to high rpm.  This starts the surface you&#39;re standing on to begin rotating at the natural speed of precession.  Now one other thing is needed.  We need to be able to increase the angular velocity of the spinning surface you&#39;re standing on so that you spin at a greater velocity than the natural precession speed.  Doing this would make the 40 pound gyroscopic wheel want to rise.  But you don&#39;t let it rise.  And additionally, you keep the pipe that&#39;s connected to the 40 pound spinning gyroscopic wheel horizontal ... it&#39;s not allowed to rise at all.  So under that operation ... what weight is the scale reading now?  I think it will be less than the dead weight of the system as previously measured. Additionally, I think there&#39;s an angular velocity above the natural speed of precession which will result in the system levitating.  So I think I agree with Eric Laithwaite (there is something here that everybody has previously missed).  And if I&#39;m wrong I&#39;d love for you to prove me wrong by actual demonstration using the scenario I&#39;ve just outlined .", "comment_date": "2018-07-18T00:27:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TRUTH", "comment_text": "Evolution, Gravity, And The Globe, Are Science Fiction.", "comment_date": "2018-07-17T20:35:47Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "cha mcIntyre", "comment_text": "you have the makings of a flying saucer", "comment_date": "2018-07-17T14:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pete Conrad", "comment_text": "Nothing whatsoever to do with gravity.", "comment_date": "2018-07-17T12:03:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Victorson", "comment_text": "I still don&#39;t understand how it works", "comment_date": "2018-07-17T02:54:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meowdy", "comment_text": "If anyone say that fake Check your Physics book :D", "comment_date": "2018-07-17T01:54:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Koaasst", "comment_text": "i chuckled at DYEL", "comment_date": "2018-07-16T14:48:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Godwin Gameli", "comment_text": "Hmmm maybe Thor has spinning flywheel embedded in his hammer \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-07-16T09:19:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elvis Sanjines", "comment_text": "Hola doblaje al espa\u00f1ol porfa desde ECUADOR", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T18:48:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James LaFleur", "comment_text": "so you find a way to anti the gravity?", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T12:24:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gacheru Mburu", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2018-07-14T12:25:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Divyangana*", "comment_text": "Did u really use hans Zimmer music here ??", "comment_date": "2018-07-14T11:21:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angie M", "comment_text": "There is nothing that is anti-gravity because there is no such thing as Gravity.

If you include &#39;working against gravity&#39; in the term &#39;anti-gravity&#39;, then the drill can be classified as an &#39;anti-gravity generator&#39;. So this &#39;anti-gravity&#39; is not &#39;anti-gravity&#39; proper (&#39;proper&#39; meaning the commonly held notion/definition of it), but merely working against gravity, as when you jump in the air or propel yourself into space. If you include &#39;work&#39; in the definition of &#39;anti-gravity&#39;, then your legs and rocket engines would also be classified as anti-gravity generators (as would anything causing movement against the force of gravity).", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T10:59:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S\u00fcmeyye \u00c7i\u00e7ek", "comment_text": "I cried \ud83d\ude0d magnificent \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T09:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heath", "comment_text": "Nice, i didnt know that.", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T04:38:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Del Bolt", "comment_text": "lov thiss look", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T04:06:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alan Crook", "comment_text": "Prof Eric Laithwaite demonstrated this to children at the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture ages ago.", "comment_date": "2017-09-30T07:51:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kishor Rathva", "comment_text": "i know this phenomena  and understand it thnaks  to sir Walter Lewin ..", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T17:40:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "evil laughs", "comment_text": "Niic", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T13:00:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "charan devarakonda", "comment_text": "it was possibile ???", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T09:20:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GamezAhoy", "comment_text": "Im over here like i can get 60 lb over my head with 1 arm...", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T03:23:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alerde Pertian", "comment_text": "Try two counter rotating dics next !?", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T01:19:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Man in grave since 1984", "comment_text": "I wasted my time", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T15:34:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Do\u00e3n V\u0129nh Tr\u1ea7n", "comment_text": "tuy\u1ec7t qu\u00e1", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T15:15:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u72ec\u697d\u5b9f\u9a13\u5c0f\u50e7", "comment_text": "\u6163\u6027\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3001\u5186\u76e4\u3092\u66f2\u3052\u308b\u4e8b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3001\u8868\u5411\u304d\u306e\u529b\u3068\u88cf\u5411\u304d\u306e\u529b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u73fe\u8c61\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5468\u56de\u3092\u65e9\u304f\u3059\u308b\u3068\u5782\u76f4\u306b\u7acb\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T08:46:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thijs Jansen", "comment_text": "Wait .

It&#39;s a perceptual illusion well understood in terms of Gibson&#39;s theory of perception (J.J. Gibson). It&#39;s actually the handle that appears to carry all the weight at the point where it is being held. The way the wheel itself would normally appear to weigh is evaluated by the perceptual system through the torque on the handle required to hold it up(which is indeed huge when the wheel isn&#39;t spinning, as shown early in the video). However, when the wheel is spinning, this torque is being cancelled, hence the appearance that the weight is displaced close to the location where the handle is held (and, indeed, the downward force is displaced there) and the wheel itself at the other end appears to be weightless.

Upon being forced to rotate downward, the torque results in a different force. This is also the result, mathematically, of cross multiplying vectors. Two rotations added together results in a rotation that is 90 degrees apart from both other rotations, in this case to the guy&#39;s right, and clockwise. Same thing works with a bike wheel supported by a rope. It will still fall, just way slower. To those asking why it cannot help with lifting payloads: the work is still being done. The work of spinning the wheel is slowly dissipated as the wheel loses kinetic energy. A good example you can try at home would be a pinwheel/fan. Attach a string to one end of the rod, and a wheel to the other. Letting go without rotation results in it just falling. Spinning it will make it spin like you see in this video. Now, replace the string with your fingers. When it&#39;s not spinning, it&#39;s very easy to change the direction it is facing. Spin it again, and try to change where it is pointing. The resistance you feel is what is holding that wheel up. Without rotating it, try lifting it up, down, left, and right. If there is no rotation, you should experience no resistance. That is why these cannot be used for rockets, or lightening payloads or hovercraft.

No changes of weight, also if the gyroscope is spinning with its axis of rotation in horizontal position. <br>All its weight is transferred to the contact point on the base of the gyroscope.<br>Sorry for believers in antigravity UFOs or such things.", "comment_date": "2016-08-20T15:03:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LuigiFan00001", "comment_text": "That&#39;s actually pretty cool! :D", "comment_date": "2016-08-19T15:59:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keena_McDisneyDork", "comment_text": "Eagual", "comment_date": "2016-08-19T04:51:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ed Me", "comment_text": "If it was really antigravity, it would be moving at over 483,000 miles per hour.

Fake CGI NASA photos (not actual evidence)<br> 2.?....<br> OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE OF FLAT EARTH:<br> 1. The land is flat! No curvature yet to be found. <br> 2. Water is flat and always finds its level. Earth is 71% flat water. That&#39;s only possible on a flat earth.<br><br> 3. The horizon always rises to eye level no matter how you high you go <br>up. If earth was a ball the horizon would be constantly curving downward<br> to the underside of the ball and could never rise up to eye level.<br> 4. What goes up comes down. Gravity is fake. Everything: the air, land, and sea are all naturally arranged by density.<br><br> 5. The sun moves over us and is observably close and small. The sunset <br>is simply the sun going further away from you. It just appears to go <br>down, when it is actually the same height all the way (just like <br>airplane&#39;s appear to go down when they are flying level). It&#39;s just <br>perspective! The horizon line is just the vanishing point. The human eye<br> can only see so far.<br> 6. Crepuscular rays coming from the sun above <br>the clouds visibly prove the sun is NOT 93 million miles away! It is <br>close and in our atmosphere!<br> 7. We feel NO movement! We are not spinning at 1000 miles on a spinning ball.<br><br> 8. Planes dont adjust for curvature ever! They should be dipping their <br>noses down every minute to compensate for earth&#39;s constant ball curve, <br>but they do not. All pilots fly level on a flat earth.<br> 9. The <br>atmosphere does not move with spinning earth at 1000 miles an hour. <br>Flight times would be completly wrong with the earth spinning below the <br>planes the globe. If the atmosphere was spinning with earth then planes <br>would have to fly against the spin to go east. <br> 10. Ships that <br>&quot;disappear&quot; on the ocean horizon reappear through a telescope, zoom, or <br>binoculars. The bottom of the boat starts to disappear because it is <br>merging with the convergence line on the horizon. This is because of <br>perspective and vanishing points, not earth&#39;s imaginary curve. <br> 11. <br>The sun is clearly illuminating locally. You can see hot spots directly <br>under the sun on the clouds and on the land. This is ONLY possible with a<br> close, small sun. <br> 12. The seasons are dramatic each year. This <br>would not occur if the sun was 93 million miles away. The tilt of ball <br>earth and several thousand miles difference would not create the poles <br>and seasons as we know them. The seasons occur because the sun circles <br>the Tropic of Cancer in the summer months and the Tropic of Capricorn in<br> the winter months. This is why there is 24 hours of sunlight in the <br>Arctic during the summer. This is also why in the winter the sun is <br>lower in the sky and the days are shorter. The sun moves faster along <br>the Tropic of Capricorn because it is a much wider circle, creating <br>shorter, colder days in the north. <br> 13. The sun can be clearly seen <br>setting at an angle to the north. This is because the sun is making its <br>daily circle around flat earth.<br> 14. The sun DOES change in size as <br>it gets closer and farther away. This is only possible if it is close <br>and small and illuminating locally.<br> 15. Compasses always point to <br>north. This is only possible on a flat earth with a magnetic North Pole <br>and with east and west circling around the center. If earth was a ball, <br>then how could a compass point north on the bottom of a ball?<br> 16. <br>The moon is close! It illuminates the clouds directly around it which <br>would be impossible if it was 200,000 miles away. You can also see the <br>topography of the moon with a telescope. This would be impossible of it <br>was so far away. <br> 17. Many deserts and planes have been documented <br>as completely flat yet they go on for hundreds of miles. How is this <br>possible on a ball earth with a circumference of 24,901 miles? Answer: <br>it&#39;s not!<br> 18. The Suez Canal is over 100 miles long and has no locks because it is on a complexity flat plane! No curvature!<br><br> 19. Abyssal planes under the ocean are completely flat for hundreds of <br>miles...some of the flattest land on earth. There is no curve! The water<br> above it is completely flat!<br> 20. Flat paths make WAY more sense on a<br> flat earth map. Many flight paths are ridiculous on a globe, going <br>completely out of their way. But on the flat earth map the same flight <br>will be a straight shot!<br> 21. WHERE&#39;S THE CURVE????<br> The earth is FLAT!! We&#39;ve been lied to!

Here&#39;s my explanation: it isn&#39;t, in reality, any lighter than when it isn&#39;t spinning. But it does require much more effort to hold it horizontally because, while it takes very little effort to simply suspend 40 pounds from one&#39;s hand (this happens in both cases), it would require a Herculean effort to supply sufficient ROTATIONAL force, also called torque, using only the small muscles in one&#39;s forearm - the whole thing is like seesaw centered at the man&#39;s wrist, and to hold it horizontally when not spinning, he would have to resist this tendency to rotate by supplying an equivalent amount of torque. But when spinning, a curious thing happens. In an idealized situation, all the man needs to do is supply the upward 40 pound force, without that torque required in the other case, to keep it from falling to the ground. This can also be seen in a gyroscope suspended from a string - since the string is flexible, it is virtually unable to supply any rotational force in the direction an unspun wheel would tend to rotate, but the spun gyroscope stays nearly horizontal even though the string really only supplies an upward tension force. Also, notice that in both the spun and unspun cases, torque does cause a rotation - towards the ground when unspun, and horizontal when spinning very fast - but the man in the video only attempts to resist this rotational tendency in the first case. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, people who are better in physics than I am, but I would expect that it would take the same torque to resist the rotation around a vertical axis in the second case as would be required to resist rotation about a horizontal axis in the first.", "comment_date": "2016-03-06T06:42:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean Dafny", "comment_text": "Tight", "comment_date": "2016-03-06T04:48:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryane Alvizo", "comment_text": "Do you think that&#39;s how Thor does it he ", "comment_date": "2016-03-06T03:25:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark", "comment_text": "Eh, simple one dimensional kinetics.", "comment_date": "2016-03-06T02:28:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vykodyn", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sure there is somebody on this planet capable of holding that up horizontally.", "comment_date": "2016-03-06T02:10:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marnele Kamaka", "comment_text": "he has super powers", "comment_date": "2016-03-06T02:08:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MoMax", "comment_text": "....or veratasium is secretly hench!", "comment_date": "2016-03-05T20:21:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "spn", "comment_text": "I feel like there&#39;s something about the circle we haven&#39;t figured out yet.", "comment_date": "2016-03-05T17:20:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Masin Markert", "comment_text": "can anyone else not see the video", "comment_date": "2016-03-05T16:38:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheang Leng", "comment_text": "I know exactly why that is.", "comment_date": "2016-03-05T14:41:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bitfreakazoid", "comment_text": "Does the direction of gyroscopic spin affect the direction the whole thing wants to spin in his hands when he lifts it up?", "comment_date": "2016-03-05T05:04:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Person", "comment_text": "my dad rich piana also my favorite natural bodybilder could lift that easy", "comment_date": "2016-03-04T17:37:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ravi Kant", "comment_text": "sir, can we make a gravity free area without accelerating it in the direction of gravity?plz let me know sir..m mechanical engg student,2nd yr", "comment_date": "2016-03-03T22:39:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "burgerbread1", "comment_text": "gfdsrg", "comment_date": "2016-03-03T17:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaydeep Koradiya", "comment_text": "its the magnus effect which is producing lift on the rotating part hence it seems light weighted.<br>Trust me I am an aerodynamicist. hehehe", "comment_date": "2016-03-03T12:24:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Care Kids", "comment_text": "put that on a car boom flying car", "comment_date": "2016-03-02T17:25:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Osman SMxs#", "comment_text": "more", "comment_date": "2016-03-02T15:36:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wpfabi Wpfabi", "comment_text": "Heya, The most safe and fastest diet plan that I have ever had was with Jans super plan (you can google it) Without a doubt the most helpful diet that I have ever used.", "comment_date": "2016-03-02T07:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G and K", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty sure it would weigh the same.

It has enough energy to go in that direction because the energy of the drill got transferred into the wheel, and the energy of the wheel got transferred into the air, when the wheel is still(held up by hand, held down by gravity), the same amount of energy is used up then if it were moving, energy only deplenishes if friction is involved, and you can add more friction to the wheel by using energy(your own) the friction is added to the object when trying to get it to spin and when trying to first move it, this all follows a rule. Anti-gravity translates to basically defying gravity, that cannot happen unless energy is applied to the object that is is trying to defy it in the first place, so I guess you can call this an anti-gravity wheel if you want, but it&#39;s nothing as cool as magic, (as it doesn&#39;t follow the laws of physics).", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T03:42:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WippityWop", "comment_text": "That&#39;s a pro gravity wheel lol", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T00:04:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Andon", "comment_text": "Just showed us how ufos work", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T20:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoxyU", "comment_text": "UFO work like that.", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T18:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0441\u0430\u0448 \u0436\u0430", "comment_text": "sorry, bad know English)  RF. \u0414\u0432\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438?", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T18:20:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChrissyDunKno", "comment_text": "Maybe he&#39;s just Thor...", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T18:15:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Veldtian1", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDf4ooPdo&amp;t=0m12s\">0:12</a> &quot;Shaft&quot; tee-hee..!", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T16:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "y z", "comment_text": "fake", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T13:23:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Domingo Berdomas", "comment_text": "espa\u00f1ol", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T12:23:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SGT Pikachu", "comment_text": "Aussie", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T11:27:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sysiphistication", "comment_text": "What would be the effect of the wheel if it were in-line with the shaft?", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T07:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Verkrustet", "comment_text": "you&#39;re standing there talking about what you&#39;re going to do while the wheel&#39;s losing speed, ya damn dingus.  damn that was annoying.", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T22:11:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lee Wen", "comment_text": "gyroscope", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T09:54:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Creepy Toaster96", "comment_text": "bruh this is how you make a ufo", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T09:41:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Babcock", "comment_text": "welcome to how to trick your friends into thinking you have super strength", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T01:43:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J- wu", "comment_text": "that&#39;s why some of UFOs keep spinning itself?", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T01:02:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dixie faps", "comment_text": "pro tip: put it on a bike and a boat<br><br>vertical in bike<br>horizontal on boats<br>?????<br>profit", "comment_date": "2016-01-22T15:19:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phuket Word", "comment_text": "Free energy", "comment_date": "2016-01-22T09:01:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanky Winslow", "comment_text": "I see he got Bernie sanders to spin the wheel for him", "comment_date": "2016-01-22T08:07:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaitlynn Layman", "comment_text": "what would happen if you just let go while it was in the air?

Anything will not fall without gravity. Spinning things also fall. When a thing with axial stick spin, its collected rotation power send force to not only air around it; sending air contacting it to different directions.  It sends air up, down, left, right, and... It also send force to the axial stick. The portion of mass on the spinning downward side pulls down sending force on the axial rigid solid stick in the line to one&#39;s hand(s); but the opposite portion pulls up. Like when one swing a ball with rope, when the ball going down it pulls one&#39;s hand down; and when the ball going up it really has force on one&#39;s hand (the force pulling the hand upward). It should be because of rigidity of the stick makes the weight of the spinning wheel moving from its center to the hand(s). Maybe by something like shaking like a stick if one vibrates a tip of the stick up and down rapidly, the other tip will send force down and up hitting ground or a holding hand on the side of the other tip. I imagine so. So, It should be a bit shaking holding the axial stick; but the opposite forces happen in the same time with very high frequency, so that, it must be hard to feel.    When the spinning is very powerful, the pulling forces would be very strong, much stronger than gravity force like elephant and ant. So that, the feeling of the gravity doing something at the wheel point is like zero. Maybe, gravity force was also combined with the spinning force and make the feeling of the wheel weight at the hand point. The weight total is still the same, but the feeling of law of the lever is almost disappear. For the precession, I think the spinning switch gravity&#39;s effect from pulling the wheel down to pushing the wheel to the direction that the bottom portion of the wheel&#39;s mass going to. Gravity force that pulls one side (right side; if spin right side down) down making the rotation force of the mass portion increase. Rotation power(increased) on the bottom of the wheel pushes the wheel precession moonwalking around the center. Rotation power which still increased on the left side pull the wheel up. Rotation power going down because of gravity effect on the left side(going up). This thinking, however, is weird because of thinking both sides separately to portions while they are connected to the other side rigidly. When the mass portion is near the top position of the wheel, rotation power which going down sends lower force pulling wheel to the opposite side of the precession. So the wheel when not standing upright, will make precession. If still using portion thinking for the other precession phenomenon (pushing faster in the same direction of precession and the wheel lift up), it might make sense. That because one increases force and speed to the direction, which makes the rotation force of the bottom and left (mass portion that going up) increased. So the wheel lift up. Are those make sense?

For those of you that don&#39;t understand quite yet... think of it this way. When you are holding the weight still (static), you have to not only hold the gravitational force up, but you must apply torque to counter balance the torque of the wheel toward the ground. When you spin the wheel at a few thousand RPM, you are introducing a very large kinetic energy, and we all know that kinetic energy DOES something! The kinetic energy of the wheel spinning creates torque, which replaces the force that your &quot;torque&quot; hand had to produce in order to keep the wheel from tilting toward the ground. Now, your body is only exerting force to hold the vertical gravitational force, giving the effect that the object is lighter. The object isn&#39;t lighter, you are just exerting less force to perform the same task because a machine took care of half the task for you ^_^", "comment_date": "2015-08-17T06:02:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Robert Vaughan", "comment_text": "Magnus Effect anyone?", "comment_date": "2015-08-17T01:02:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AFX LAB", "comment_text": "Probably how those ships from oblivion work.", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T19:13:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Lovett", "comment_text": "Ok make 2 disc&#39;s that are twice the size with the same weight (don&#39;t make them solid) but hollow and rotate them at opposite rotations at twice the speed in this vid and watch what happens...<br>", "comment_date": "2015-08-16T10:03:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fireforeffect", "comment_text": "Have you combined a series of them in a sphere type approach.<br>Wouldn&#39;t by controlling the speed of specific wheels create a control of direction.<br>Be it any direction.

If I am wright then increasing the length of the bar should make it seem even lighter.<br>Now here&#39;s a question for you: the energy stored in the giro effect( the disc spining,)consumes?????,( the test would be to see if the disc spinns for more time if beeing hold from a short bar then it would if from a long bar", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T13:28:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Voss", "comment_text": "What would happen if you replaced the upward force of his arm with a rocket/ propulsion device?", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T11:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRomax069", "comment_text": "Mj\u00f6llnir ?!? ^^", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T10:10:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raphael Agustin", "comment_text": "Ve-man masters of the universe", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T03:56:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soma Drummond", "comment_text": "based on what you have proven would that also contribute to much heavier weights in the same fashion? and if so, if found a way to make a fly-wheel capable of spinning it&#39;s self such object could be spun and used like a hammer but the rotation+ weight+ velocity of the object would deal the most devistating blow.

I see apparently similar plot to this &#39;Schwarzschild Solution&#39; in its determination... Only thing missing to this arithmetic jargon is the auspicious visual perception that gravity field is susceptible to twin opposing directions and orientation of its constituent &#39;flux&#39; elements--yielding a bipolar field of some sort... However, talking about &#39;white hole&#39; and &#39;black holes&#39; suggests almost the same thing... same phenomena... That is--possible &#39;Convergence&#39; and &#39;Divergence&#39; of toroidal fields constituting a typical wormhole or/and, depending on a perspective, warped space curvature of a virtual toroid...<br><br><b>*</b><br><br>In a way, you are seeing it the way i do to a certain verifiable part...<br><br>Well, it is matter of trying to see things in empirical sense of observation.<br><br>Say any spherical body suspended in space is composed of twin &#39;essences&#39; of counter rotating quasi-matter whose dynamic coalescence yield &#39;spinning momentum&#39; if one such constituent &#39;quasi-matter&#39; is excessive to a course...<br><br>If the dynamic resolve of such activity is a solid body like our planet, the lethargy of the whole dense body conceal a whole form of hidden activity which is evident withing the volume of its subsequent sphere of influence... The net sum of overall activity being characterized by the virtual amount of &#39;quasi-matter&#39;...<br><br>Then comes the geometry; you can understand the Universe better in terms of &#39;discs&#39; and &#39;spheres&#39;... Which is technically analogous to &#39;Spheres&#39; and &#39;Cubes&#39;...<br><br>Therefore any sphere of form is constituted by virtually twin opposing disc dynamics which bulge into &#39;spherical&#39; particle...<br><br>How can this translate into the gravity mechanics? My present basic perception is: Any material body entering a certain context of gravity field of the other, is virtually induced with a twin set of counter rotating &#39;discs&#39;... Geometrically you can\u00a0 deduce their effectiveness by simply attributing to (1) radius/diameter of a located object for a cross sectional circle bounded by sphere of influence and also (2) the distance between the matters of mutual interaction--thus center of gravity, which is another way to denote, a tendency to seek a common singularity of activity.<br><br>So along the diameter, say if Subject B about to enter the sphere of influence of Subject A thus at the cusp of external virtual surface of the A, let assume A to be the Earth, as it dopes r distance from the outer, it possesses a &#39;virtual disc&#39; rotating in C&#39;Wise direction--then again, along the diameter of the subject A &#39;s sphere of influence, and r distance from the other end; there is another virtual counter disc rotating in Anti C&#39; wise direction...<br><br>SO what could be the actual speed of its &#39;virtual&#39; rotation?<br><br>Well, lets say all around the outer surface of the sphere of influence the Imploding &#39;Escape Velocity&#39; is referred.<br><br>Then with simple triangular geometry you can deduce the circular resultant velocity with a Cosine Resolution of velocity; Assuming maximum velocity is always at the &#39;Equator&#39; of any given spherical body...<br><br>So then, what if you manipulate the &#39;virtual discs&#39; &#39;s moments? This implies you are directly maneuvering, not only the rate of fall, but also possible counteraction of the fall itself... It is more-less, a classical potential of any gyroscopic element...<br><br>This is more like classical mechanics, how can it be manipulated from the electrical point of view?<br><br>A considerable knowledge of the Direct Current and Capacitance can be applied to suggest a typical anti gravity drive...<br><br>Without forgetting -- some indispensable elements of your triangular resolution of forces.

You get a spinning top spin it it hoovers abover the ground. its weightless. Only reason a spinning top or spinning wheel doesnt take off is because it has no propulsion system to make it airbourne. Once the spinning motion stops the top falls over and no more gravity. This is the same as the spinning top spins it seperates from air to gravity spectrim. If it had say a engine that could propulse it into the air and make it move with out you doing it yourself. We can and have proven we can break gravity we just cant get the propulsion right and the correct stability which I know magnets can do and have proven it. And will prove it soon. All your doing is using your body as the propulsion system. What you need to do is find a system like mine that would propulse it into the air by itself and spin in real gravity. it you let it go what would it do? Drop to the ground and the shaft your holding would spin uncontrolablly and you would have to wait till it stopped to control it again. And the reason it stays up isd your holding it up it would stay up your holding it up. So its NOT anti Gravity. An anti gravity spins above the earth with no person holding it while it spins. Anti gravity uses its own or a propulsion system like I created to make it fly and stay flying not fall down once you let it go. As this clearly would do. Making giant spinning tops and saying they are anti gravity is making a mockery of real people who do the real work looking for solutions. You get and old spinning top with the push in pull out system when you get a lot of speed on those tops the spin clearly ABOVE the ground and the faster you push and pull the faster it goes the more it wants to take off. So if you put a propulsion system in it it would fly. Fact try it. The when its spinning hold the handle and spin it in a sideways motion weightless as soon as you let it go it spins in uncontrolable directions.

Like how this 40 pound wheel felt light when spun to high rpms but wanted to precess around his head in a certain direction. But if you can use spheres contained within eachother and have them all wanting to pull the metal rod or handle a certain direction due to inertial force then it would make a giant weapon like thors hammer because the steel balls will all equally cancel out the flow of where their high rpm rotation wants to take them and thus the rod attached to the 3 spheres each sphere inside the other will act like its just an object with the weight of the rod its attached too. Then after you have made such a device, you could swing such a mallet that weighs 50-100 pounds like a baseball bat!!! Literally like thors hammer. Even though it feels light to the person holding it but to the object or person it hits it would feel like they were hit by something that weighed 50-100 pounds being swung as fast as someone can swing a baseball \u00a0bat!
