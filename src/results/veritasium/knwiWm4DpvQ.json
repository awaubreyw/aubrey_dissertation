The answer for that is like in bar magnet the magnetic field is strong at the ends (poles) same works there earth is like a bar magnet the north and south pole of the earth have high magnitude of magnetic field and due to this fact the speed of the helical motion will be faster than any other parts of the earth . And clearly more speed more the excitation more will be the intensity of visible and light and we can see it clearly .<br><br>correct??", "comment_date": "2019-08-21T07:10:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "forever yours", "comment_text": "And when there&#39;s a solar  flair, SG1 travel back in time \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2019-08-06T14:56:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Christopher", "comment_text": "Particles from the sun hit the earths magnetosphere.", "comment_date": "2019-06-27T01:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xingdeng Dong", "comment_text": "I learned this northan light at school so Im looking at this its pretty", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T20:43:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mech", "comment_text": "&quot;Why do you make people look stupid&quot;<br><br><br>Also people: Neurons come from the sun", "comment_date": "2019-06-01T15:18:08Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Staci Case", "comment_text": "I saw them in Wyoming   wintertime of course.
