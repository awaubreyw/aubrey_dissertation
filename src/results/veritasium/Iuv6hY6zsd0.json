Due to the fact that since photons are the oldest thing in the universe most of the earlier electromagnetic forces that existed within photons that were prone to colliding with other wavelengths would have over time been eliminated leaving behind the most elusive wavelength in the observable Universe. I feel as if \u201cparticles\u201d have their own evolutionary paths like everything else in the Universe. Due to the fact that energy takes the path of least resistance. Thus, only light that is observable can be seen. Within a given time reference or \u201cvertical\u201d you can only see the photons wavelength that is nearest to the observation. Thus all the other information no longer exist in that frame of reference, or point in time. I don\u2019t believe in the cat experiment, not per say. However I do believe that given the fact that light was likely emitted first during the Big Bang that there might be \u201cholograms\u201d that do actually exist in other frames of references where the observation of the missing wavelengths really did occur. However, I think from any given frame of reference one could only conclude that the consciousness of the observers other then themselves can only be a distorted version of themselves. Whether  or not the parallel universes were real or not couldn\u2019t be determined. However I think that theoretically one day through the process of elimination we can eventually come up with a working probability distribution that at the very least can make this appear very probable. I don\u2019t think we can prove it without a doubt, but I think that by comparing the microscopic with the macroscopic that we can rule out most other possibilities. From our frame of reference, given the vertical axis that our system likely exist on, the data that we could get describing other planes of existence would be skewed, and stretched. Even at maximum efficiency in computation. At the best and most rational, I think that we could conclude that they are stretched versions of our reality. It would be difficult to prove that they are more then just illusions created by the warping of the information we would see when observing the photons that hit our plane of existence. Thus, as we observe further and further away from the data that can be gathered within our system the probability distribution would become more and more inaccurate over time.", "comment_date": "2022-09-23T15:19:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raka 7", "comment_text": "i&#39;m studying about it but the textbook was making me dizzy. thanks", "comment_date": "2022-09-23T05:07:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shivam Jhaveri", "comment_text": "Hello E STAR BATCH", "comment_date": "2022-09-22T06:42:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TyTimeIsAwesome", "comment_text": "How did they prove light was a particle too though?", "comment_date": "2022-09-21T05:58:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harlequin", "comment_text": "oh man that title kinda aged bad", "comment_date": "2022-09-20T09:25:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cheez crisp", "comment_text": "How did this pop up in my recomendations 9 years later.", "comment_date": "2022-09-20T08:17:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "El Pichichi", "comment_text": "Do this in Texas and you\u2019ll be gunned down because this is not in the Bible", "comment_date": "2022-09-20T00:17:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roman Rodr\u00edguez Syzonov", "comment_text": "I saw this vid 4 years ago and didn&#39;t understand now I have a test set it and I act get and love it", "comment_date": "2022-09-19T22:31:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "me lol", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve done a couple &quot;double slit&quot; experiments myself...", "comment_date": "2022-09-19T01:06:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Abhiraj Bhokare", "comment_text": "Brilliant.", "comment_date": "2022-09-18T14:32:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UY Entertain", "comment_text": "light is a electromagnetic radiation", "comment_date": "2022-09-18T04:52:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pogwater", "comment_text": "that&#39;s... actually really cool.  never thought i would be this interested in such a simple concept, but that&#39;s just how light is.", "comment_date": "2022-09-16T22:26:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Makarand Barve", "comment_text": "Why average person is not familiar with this <br>I learned it all in my college in 11th standard..

For example the rules electricity, magnetism, and light were discovered to have are in common.  It is a clue to new rules when rules don&#39;t work with phenomena they should. The rules of wave mechanics don&#39;t work when there is one slit open. The rules of particles don&#39;t work when there are 2 slits open.  The exact same rules work for either case when we use the rules of quantum mechanics.  The key rule the 2 slit reveals is that when you have 2 or more paths you add &quot;probability amplitudes&quot;. which are just arrows that turn like hands on a clock very fast, and stop depending on the time light takes to go those paths. When there&#39;s one slit open there is only 1 arrow. When 2 slits open there are 2 arrows. Any path to any point on the screen where the arrows point in mostly the same direction has a band of light, any path to any point where they point in opposite directions there is no light. Simple as that. Goofy as that.", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T09:24:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Potion of ocean", "comment_text": "I&#39;m very grateful to youtube..... \ud83c\udf4e", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T21:29:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Potion of ocean", "comment_text": "What&#39;s green light red light?<br>My brain: Squid game ! \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T21:24:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MATH MAN", "comment_text": "thats the best video explaining ydse so far", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T07:38:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zoltan Andy", "comment_text": "yes it can be a particle if and only if it is the waves of energy in space that carry the particles of light. <br>perhaps we have a fundamentally wrong understanding of the double-slit phenomena.", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T05:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fede Vargas", "comment_text": "Hi Derek, I&#39;ve been following you for a long time and sometimes youtube suggests vintage jewelry like this.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

Now photons don&#39;t interact with magnetic fields or electric fields, but can interact with neutrinos because they carry a weak charge and neutrinos do indirectly interact with (electro)magnetic fields, and even cardboard has tiny little particles and those particles do have their own magnetic fields. Maybe we see this diffraction of light, because the photons interact with the neutrinos which travel just as fast, because neutrinos do indirectly interact with the tiny magnetic fields from the particles of the cardboard?<br>If we manege to divert just the neutrinos first before photons go through those narrow slits, maybe the result could be different? Perhaps a ring of neodymium magnets can help divert neutrinos prior to sending photons through the double slits, or a tesla vortex coil with high current? Has this ever been tested this way?

It&#39;s a new and elegant way of understanding the universe and cosmos. And there are some really mindblowing facts such as the Universe didn&#39;t start with a Big Bang, nor has an age, and is infinite.  Also, black holes are not working the way we think, nor is the speed of light. Its reverse, light travel with the speed as due to the very property of cosmos. Kind of a loop element.

This factor could seem to hold a great deal of importance as to the end result of the expirement, and I will give an analogy to try and explain why; to the human eye, a rotating fan looks as if the fan blades occupy the entire circumfrence of the circular perimeter that which the fan blades are possibly able to move. However, by observing the fan blades when the fan is \u201coff\u201d, or not in rotation, we know that the fan blades only cover a portion of the total area that is perceived to be occupied when the fan blades are in rotation. Using this analogy, isn\u2019t it possible that the entire path taken by a given electron that is being \u201cejected\u201d and flung towards either one of the two slits in the double-slit experiment, as well as all of the possible paths that an electron could take, could be perceived by the detection equipment, or the \u201cspace\u201d in the electron\u2019s path, to be filled with the electron at all times if the conductors of the expirement were \u201cshooting\u201d the electrons out at a fast enough rate, which would cause the resulting pattern on the impact wall to look as if there was indeed some sort of wave interference as a result of both slits being filled with the electron (as the results conclude)?", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T20:05:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shivani Pandey", "comment_text": "There can be no better explanation than this...theoretically I  was facing prblm in understanding but this vedio made all my doubt Clr", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T17:19:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ibad Malik", "comment_text": "Yeah light is a wave... but a wave of what??", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T15:17:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Igor Salerno", "comment_text": "I love this yellow shirt man, so incredible how excited he is!", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T14:48:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Misa", "comment_text": "people who have seen pewdiepies video", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T12:04:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "giangviet do", "comment_text": "Sang vn h\u1ecfi h\u1ecdc sinh l\u1edbp 12 \u00e1nh s\u00e1ng l\u00e0 g\u00ec th\u00ec l\u00e0 l\u01b0\u1ee1ng t\u00ednh s\u00f3ng h\u1ea1t , c\u00f2n h\u1ecfi hi\u1ec7n t\u01b0\u1ee3ng trong h\u1ed9p l\u00e0 g\u00ec th\u00ec l\u00e0 nhi\u1ec5u x\u1ea1 \u00e1nh s\u00e1ng =))) ez vl", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T11:19:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "In Search of value", "comment_text": "do you just find people who have not studied physics", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T06:33:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irving Teran", "comment_text": "Who can a wave travel in the  vacuum tho?

Where E is the total energy , p is  the momentum, c is the speed of light and m is the mass of an object or mass element<br><br>A photon is a basic unit of light carry energy from a source of light, such as  the Sun <br>Since a photon particle is assumed by human subjective interpretation as to have no mass <br>If it is considered to  be a particle , then according to Einstein&#39;s energy formula , it has E= 0 (c^2) = 0 j which is nomsense , because it is contradictory to the objective and undeniable fact known to everyone that light always transmits thermal  energy in the  form of heat at least <br>So it has to do with mass-transport , in order for Einstein&#39;s formula to be valid or parallel to objective reality that light transmits heat from a source of light to wherever it reaches<br><br>Some physists argue that photons must be waves , but not particles , in order for Einstein&#39;s formula of energy to make sense, because a wave does not have anything to do with any moving mass, but merely a transmission of an external influence through the oscillations or vibrations of the mass elements of  a disturbed substance. In this case the disturbed substance or nedium is the space of the universe<br>So E^2 = (pc)^2 + m^2c^4 becomes E = pc <br>But p= mv ---&gt; E = mvc = 0*vc =0 which is nonsense, because the formula is opposite to the objective and undeniable fact known to everyone<br>It obviously  means to you guys  that Einstein&#39;s formula of energy is unparallel to the objective and undeniable facts known to everyone,  and therefore  unapplicable in objective reality<br>Or a photon must  have   a mass in order for his subjective interpretation to be valid <br>Then they keep trying to force their fallacious argument that an object with no mass nor energy can never be at rest in order for it to exist physically as light or photons, and that since we always can choose a reference frame so that we will travel along with the object if its speed is smaller than the speed of light to see it being at rest  , it must travel at the max-speed possible or  the speed of light, and that momentum without any moving mass can be possible through a wave which has nothing to do with any moving mass.<br><br> It might sound logical when you are just looking at the surface-meanings defined by the language&#39;s dictionary, but when you have a closer view of their superficial understandings of the phenomena of wave , it turns out to be nonsense , because no matter whatever argument they can come up with , they just can never ignore the most important fact that without a medium or mass-elements of the space between a source of light and the destination where light can reach, no sort of any energy nor any influence can be transmitted from the source to the destination <br>The clueless  idea that electromagnetic waves can travel through space or even a vacuum without any medium  is totally brainless and an expression of unbelievably ignorant  , because even when all other forms of natter were removed from the infinite space of the universe including hydrogen and helium particles , except the pure space itself which is the only form of matter left as the absolute or perfect vacuum space making up the infinite space of the universe,  the pure space itself would be  always already a form of matter or a medium for the influence from the Sun to the Earth in the form of thernal energy or heat from the Sun to the Earth  to be transmitted through it <br>The question here I have for all you guys  is what makes up an absolute or perfect vacuum or the pure space of the universe <br>No human has ever asked such a question before , I must say <br>Locality properties can never be omitted, simply because science is based on observable , objective and undeniable facts , but not on any sort of ghost games or magic with witchy properties like consequences without any cause    <br>You can never send any  sort of force or influence  nor any signal of any  sort through a distance in space from one location in space to another in space without any immediate medium connecting the 2 locations and acting  as the transporter of the influence <br> <br> So what are the mass elements of the space of the universe , such as the specific space between the Sun and the Earth,  which oscillate or viberate to transmit the heat from the Sun to the Earth?<br>The  answer to this  question is going to clear up all human vague and ambiguous concepts of energy , light or photon particles,  and can shed light on the unsolved mystery of the causes of endless rotational motions of such large celestial objects as planets in this solar system, stars , galaxies,  and of so small mass elements as electrons around the centres of pulling forces<br><br>This question is the sane as asking what constitute the infinite space of the universe without alll other forms of matter , and the only one form of matter is the pure space itself <br>I am 100 percent sure that none of current human best minds  or scientists can answer that question of mine , because all of them have been copying and worshipping tye same patterns of fundamental misunderstandings of what human limited knowledge can observe <br>I certainly have the answer to it,  based on objective reality and  all human achievements in natural science known to every human scientist without any sort of subjective interpretation<br>More explanation about  how light waves is formed and thermal energy from the Sun is transfered to the Earth through the space of the solar system  <br>What create thermal energy or heat to be transmitted from the Sun surface to the Earth and other forms of matter in this solar system is  the massive  thermal energy released from neuclear fusion reactions inside the Sun . The extreme heat and radiation cause the mass elements of what constitutes the surrounding space of the Sun move extremely fast and causing extreme pushing  forces  which are  transmited through out the  space between the Sun and other forms of matter including the Earth , and such pushing forces  cause mass elements of what constitutes the space in this solar system to move faster and faster, and their oscillating motions carry kinetic energy which is transmited as thermal energy when absorbed by all other forms of matter in the solar system ,.The extreme thermal energy or extreme heat from the  Sun is converted into kinetic energy in fast moving mass elements of the space in the solar system, and then converted back to thermal energy or heat when it is absorbed here on the Earth. The observed heat causes the  mass elements in your physical structure or body to move faster and when they move faster,  their kinetic energy is transferred to become thermal energy again  .That is why you can feel the increasing temperature  of all forms of matter under sunlight<br>So Einstein&#39;s energy formula obviously exposes the flaws and defective holes if his theories or subjective interpretations or  human -invented concepts of light or photons are unapplicable in objective reality <br>Light can  never be any sort of particle in Einstein&#39;s formula of energy , although it can be  a sort of wave or packets of  energy transmitted through the oscillations of  mass elements of the pure  space of the solar system , you will still  have to find what make up the pure space <br>I can prove so many  theorems and formulas  of Einstein, Newton and others to be nothing else other than their own subjective interpretations , but not parallel to objective and undeniable facts, and therefore invalid or unapplicable", "comment_date": "2021-07-01T18:40:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MojaSzerokosc", "comment_text": "I&#39;m amazed that those people did not have a physics class at their school.

Some of the incoming light hits the sides of the slit and, angle of incidence equals angle of refraction.  So the places where that light reflected off the sides of the slit at an angle that caused the light to either bounce back toward the source or bounce back and forth within the slit until losing so much energy that the wave collapses, this second option is the more likely one.  This &quot;wasted&quot; light never reaches the screen, thus giving us the dark spots.  The lit spots also are a result of these same mechanics.  As for why the light appears to be a circle inside the box, it&#39;s actually an elongated cylinder with a half circle on each end, due to the fact that the light is also reflecting off the top and directly into the corners of the slits themselves....  So in conclusion, the interference pattern we see is the direct result of one simple fact not taken into account in any single or double slit experiments that I have ever seen.. the material we are using to create the slits is 3 dimensional and the walls of the slit itself are the reason for the interference.   <br><br>  This  is very clear to me.  light waves are really really short, so to do this experiment one would need a 2 dimensional substance to create the slits, then you would see two slits of light inside the box.

It actually continued to be a minoritary view until at least the mid 1820s, and it was not before Young, Arago and Fresnel had (painfully) come to the conclusion (because of several new properties of light related to the phenomenon of polarization) that light had to be a TRANSVERSE wave, rather than longitudinal, as Young first supposed (his studies with light started with his analogy between light and sound), that some of the still troubling aspects of the undulatory explanations (for example the DARK central spot in Newton&#39;s rings, where all the interference should be constructive) were finally sorted out and it became (for the time being) the new paradigm in optics. The story of this paradigmatic shift is indeed a gorgeous chapter in the history of physics, and one that triggered the whole deconstruction of &quot;newtonian&quot; (actually laplacian) worldview and paved the way to new sets of theories not (at least fully) based on mechanics: heat, energy, electromagnetism (which eventually would encompass optics) and so on.", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T12:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aruba Sultan", "comment_text": "I am a class 12th student,, this video is really amazing, \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T10:48:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frank Meo\u00f1o", "comment_text": "I LOVE THIS ITS SO BEAUTIFUL.

When you put a straight stick into a glass of water, it looks bent. The light from the stick is bent by the water and the glass. If light was any type of magnetic wave, the stick would look straight. Also, you can see a single light photon. It&#39;s been done, that is a fact. In nature, there is no such thing as a part of a wave. It is either a wave or it is not. The shortest energetic wave is a gamma wave. The longest light photon is only 40% of the length of a  gamma wave. To see a single light photon would mean that you have part of a wave. But there is no such thing. That proves that light is nothing more than a stream of photons. And what makes the different colors, is that photons have different sizes and strengths. The stronger and larger of the photon, the more capable it is of passing through various resistances. Because this experiment does not use a laser, the light is not coming from a single direction. If you think it is, then you are not realising the strength and minuteness of light. So when the light is reflected off of the sides of the holes, (and because it is not a laser, it is reflecting) then the stronger and weaker photons are separated and are causing the rainbow.", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T19:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kelly Cox", "comment_text": "This was one of my favorite units to teach when I taught HS physics.", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T18:34:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "rohan dewda", "comment_text": "If two different balls are used to create waves,then the two sources are&#39;nt coherent", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T15:40:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Astronomy and science", "comment_text": "Light is wave as well as particle according to different theories", "comment_date": "2021-04-01T14:57:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrCoffis", "comment_text": "What happens if you place a floating ball on the pond?

But the notion that photons/electrons/neutrinos have anything to do with it is hogwash. It&#39;s actually a stumbling block in our journey to find a better understanding of light. Light, by the way, is ONLY comprised of electromagnetic waves.. And human eyes can not see particles like photons/electrons/neutrinos. Our retinas can only perceive EM waves. Photons DO INDEED create electromagnetic light when they smash into atoms.  That collision causes a reaction which creates electromagnetic waves (Of a yet unknown form of energy) which then eminate (as a certain frequency) in all possible paths away from the reaction point. It&#39;s why our sky appears blue to us. Because the atoms and molecules in a certain layer of our atmosphere tend to absorb all other colors but light blue when photons smash into them. The photon did not create the light blue waves. And neither did the atoms.  The atoms merely rejected the light blue frequency and allowed it to pass.  Ergo the light blue waves travel to the very spot on Earth you are standing at. But also in all other directions including outward and away from Earth. Why then can&#39;t Astronauts see the &quot;blue&quot; when they rise above that layer in the atmosphere?  Because they are ELECTRO-MAGNETIC waves. The answer is in their name. They are attracted to the Earth&#39;s opposite electromagnetic construct, some call it the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. I call it gravity. And I believe gravity is caused by the very photons that crash into other material things to produce light (remember, light = EM waves, not particles.)  Though I prefer to call them neutrinos because I think they have a dual changing prooerty: Charged positive or negative. The chemical reaction of stars cause a positive charge (Of a yet unknown energy). When that positive neutrino strikes other physical matter a reaction occurs that creates EM waves which humans can see. And the now negative neutrino travels on into the earth, a concentrated bulk of matter which accepts the negative charge like a huge negatively charged capacitor.  That huge capacitor &quot;Earth&quot;  then attracts more positive neutrinos and also attracts  the positively charged EM waves.  It&#39;s really a lot more complicated than this. What I&#39;ve explained is analogous to your pond demonstration. In short light is positive EM energy moving through the ether in frequencies. They travel in all directions but can be pulled off any single course by a more powerful negative EM source.  And gravity is negative EM capacitance.  Very simple. Photons are neutrinos there charged negatively or positively and particulate matter. They leave stars positively charged and lose their positive charge when colliding with other physical matter. During that collision the positive charge transforms into positively charged EM waves. Positive photons traveling through space can also be pulled off course by more powerfully negatively charged capacitive bodies of mass like planets. In fact I&#39;d venture to say that most phones emanating from other stars rarely reach the Earth. But the EM waves those photons created millions of light years away do reach us in the form of twinkling stats.  The Sun&#39;s photons however showed us unobstructed. Finally, the fact that positive EM waves can be slowed or detoured by intervening planetary capacitance before reaching us implies that the speed of light is not a constant, but varies with the different turbulences it might encounter on the way too us.  For example, the EM waves from a star in the NW sky might have passed nearby 100 strong negatively charged planets on its course to reach us, giving it a higher drag factor than EM waves from a different night star whose EM waves passed nearby only 10 negatively charged planets on its path to reach us.  The 2 different speeds of light would not be the same. They can&#39;t be the same. Ergo the speed of light is not a single constant speed for all light.   E = MC squared is therefore variating.  It would be helpful for we humans to think of it as the speed of ElectroMagnetic waves instead of &quot;light.&quot; Because &quot;light&quot; is severely misunderstood. However since photons also suffer from the same drag factor that EM waves suffer from as they pass negatively charged bodies it wouldnt make a difference if we continued to believe that light is comprised of any way of particles. Which begs the question- why would any one think the speed of light is a constant? We&#39;ve known for more than a century that planets can change and affect the speed and paths of light. That&#39;s still true regardless if light is EM waves, particles, or both.", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T20:30:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Noodles", "comment_text": "whats the answer to his last question? ;-;", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T18:03:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Advesh Darvekar", "comment_text": "I&#39;m studying in physics and its really boring. <br>But in real life, its fascinating.", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T14:36:07Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Keshav Manhas", "comment_text": "why the light in the bottom of the box was not shaped like slits but rather it shaped more like blobs????", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T11:28:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anurag Singh", "comment_text": "i was solving a problem related to fringe width and YouTube suggested me this !", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T08:48:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tushar Khandare", "comment_text": "Oh!<br> These guys don&#39;t know this experiment <br>This is taught in school when you are 16y old with all the questions of high level. <br>Exclusively in India", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T05:17:29Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Conner Bergeron", "comment_text": "he tried the zoolander magnum pose lol...", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T23:40:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N\u00f4ng D\u0169ng", "comment_text": "Wait i thought we learn about this in school.

That is about to be changed by a few fellows, Herman Haus, John J. Farrell and Randell Mills. They looked at this experiment very closely. The result of that investigation Is that it is not about waves and also not about particles. It is something else all together. It is the resonance of the electrons on the outer part of the atoms on the edges of those slits, with what is going through the slits, be that light or electrons or something else. That resonance builds up a charge currents in the material of the slits, which in turn sets up a series of energetic nodes between the slits. The nodes redirect the light going through the slits to the screen, called the far field. That is how the resonance set up by the slits determines that pattern, and not how the light itself is constituted as a wave or a particle. That was a way of looking at the experiment that used only the effect caused by the light itself, without looking at effect that the slits had on what was going through the slits. That explanation was actually predicted by a Quantum Mechanical theory that was developed by those fellows, between 1986 and 1990 and which theory is being further derived currently. The theory that uses waves has had a very hard time of getting anything useful, like a device to be developed, when using the guidance of the wave based theory. Fusion and q-bits are very complicated to explain and impossible to develop using waves. Using the other theory everything becomes much more simplified. Because of that, much simpler way of doing things, at the quantum scale, have been used to develop 3 or 4 different things in a very short time, that all work exactly as predicted by that new theory and do things that the wave based theory cannot be used, to make those kinds of things. One is a molecular modeller that can construct models of atoms that are almost as perfect as are the real atoms whose parameters are found by analytical methods. The modellers using the math of wave based QM can only model the Hydrogen atom with the same degree of accuracy. Anything else, even the next atom in the periodic table, the helium atom, when modelled by wave based math, has its parameters so far off the real atom&#39;s as to be about a hundred percent off in that accuracy. <br>Another prediction of the new theory is that an electron can fall below ground  state. That is supposed to be impossible according to wave based QM. That prediction was used to make another item that uses water and a bit of potassium to release from the water, about 200 times the energy that is in the same volume of gasoline. That has been validated by two physicists at Eindhoven Technological University and by several other validations. That validation will be in the journal Nature early in 2021. There will be a demo of the device in DC, on February 4, 2021.<br><br>That same theory was first used in 1986 by Herman Haus, an electronics engineering professor at MIT, to provide to the USA Department of Defence, a purely classlcal explanation for how the Free Electron Laser works. That uses a model of the electron that, in its free state, is a 2D disk consisting of several concentric rings of electric charge and a central pole of magnetic charge. That model can be seen in the first movie of an electron made by Lund University in 2008. Another prediction, made in 1995, was that the Universe&#39;s expansion is accelerating. That was corroborated by observations made of the CMBR in 1998 and in 2012. The theory was derived using first principles of Haus&#39; non-radiation condition, Maxwell&#39;s electro-magnetism, the Stern-Gerlach experiment, Einstein&#39;&#39;s Special Theory of Relativity, the deBroglie matter wave formulation and a few other bits that are well known and fully accepted by all physicists.<br><br>The resulting theory makes thousands of other predictions, many of which have also been corroborated or have eventually been slowly homed in on, such as constants that have taken decades to be agreed on, as being the same values as were arrived at by the derivational method used for this new theory, mostly by Mills himself.", "comment_date": "2021-01-31T05:02:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Indrani Ghoshal", "comment_text": "The intro significantly made me lose my faith and hope in the human race.", "comment_date": "2021-01-31T04:25:33Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Romaisa Shaheen", "comment_text": "Before this video I don&#39;t understand this but after this I can teach others", "comment_date": "2021-01-31T03:31:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Titan eSports Official", "comment_text": "&quot;Green Chakra&quot;<br>Indian culture", "comment_date": "2021-01-31T03:17:16Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Valerian", "comment_text": "I came here because I couldnt beleive the inteference of waves that was thought to me at school.

Of course you&#39;re going to say, there is no medium. But, what is space-time if not a medium? Is it not like discrediting the medium of air if you set up an experiment on a train on a circular track? The speed of sound is going to measure the same on all parts of the track if you&#39;re measuring the speed of sound through the air on the train. If you measured the speed of sound outside the train with a wind but, your clock was calibrated by the air/wind outside the train then the speed of sound would also stay constant outside the train.

He deduced that space and time were pixelated into indivisible, 3-dimensional Planck length units (similar to the 2D pixels on your computer screen). The mathematics indicated this, and there was no solid experimental evidence for smooth \u2013 in other words not pixelated \u2013 spacetime.<br>Smooth spacetime comes with the strange implication of an infinite amount of points between any two points. The entertaining Zeno\u2019s Dichotomy Paradox confronts this problem by suggesting that if you want to get from point A to point B, you first must get half way between those two points. And to get there, you must get half way between those two points and so on ad infinitum.<br>Obviously, this paradox is silly because we usually do get to point B. however, if we do get to point B, this implies that reality is pixelated. Heisenberg\u2019s ideas of a pixelated reality were too radical for most scientists of his day except, notably, for Niels Bohr, who agreed with them. Today, more scientists agree with this digital physics notion of a pixelated spacetime. Many still do not, and believe spacetime is smooth, and without structure \u2013 not pixelated. On the other hand, most agree that a length can be no shorter than the Planck length, which suggests that reality is pixelated. So there is a good deal of confusion.<br>I believe, that until a powerful quantum gravity theory of pixelated spacetime is discovered, the issue will remain confusing.", "comment_date": "2020-05-05T20:29:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brian Jackson", "comment_text": "It&#39;s shocking how poorly people paid attention at school.

So light cancels itself due the difference between its peaks and throughs, meaning that you can structure light, if you manipulate the peaks and troughs through different frequencies. You could do that by manipulating the fundamental structure of light through something similar to electromagnetism, but instead of electrons, you manipulate photons. The interference between the peaks and throughs might be the answer in order to reach the fundaments that will allow to manipulate light as we manipulate radio waves, for example. So, every matter is based on molecules, but beyond that, it`s based on atoms, that are based on different particles. The difference between each particle is not only the interference one has upon another, that might construct or deconstruct the by-product, but also the difference in shape, angle and length of the waves itself. That would explain why light might behave like wave in a specific case, and like particle in other, since the particle effect is a by-product of the interferences between the peaks and troughs. So using Einstein famous equations, you could actually manipulate energy and turn it in matter, specific matter, if you know how to manipulate energy accordingly, not only that, but you might build subtle matter, matter based on different types of energy and so on. So... wait... our universe might be like a drop of water hovering over a surface of water, due surface tension, that manifest itself through the differences between peaks and throughs on this surface of water, that momentarily allows different wave lengths to manifest, manifesting different particles, atoms, that will then build up molecules and structure the material world we live.

Mainly toward the direction of love and compassion. Balance is the key of yin/yang. Both sides of all reality are necessary for balance. Right and left balance each other. Consciousness is God. Consciousness can not comprehend nor appreciate cold without knowledge of hot. Happiness can\u2019t be appreciated without sadness. As far as the tree\u2019s leaves reach to heaven is as far as its roots reach to hell. Many preachers of God have been found to also be pedophiles. Reality has no choice but to balance itself. Walk on the middle ground or fall off the edge of reality.  George Lucas was always right on the money with The Force = pure consciousness. Collective Consciousness Arranging atoms into reality with thoughts in Balance. Enlightenment has arrived for mankind. That\u2019s why the United States is currently divided so greatly. Science and God are fusing. Right side is fighting the evolution to enlightenment. They are conservatively stuck in the physical words of the Bible and miss the bigger picture message  of \u201clove your enemy.\u201d They\u2019d rather build weapons and act in fear &amp; retaliation. Reality Mathematics says a negative plus a negative equals a BIGGER negative. A negative plus a positive can equal positive if the positive is large enough. The lost are on the conservative side and this science of quantum mechanics shows us this as fact &amp; cause for division. They think MONEY/material (the real Tool of lust/Satan) is where the answer lies. Every decision being made today is regarded to money. Mankind will be taken to the edge of extinction until the enlightenment occurs; will we be saved.

[FS] &amp; [FT] align static axis with active axis ie at 90 degrees to each other: The fields are pretty local:\r<br># 3 Say: A particle is accelerated in a line towards a screen: a moving particle collapses the fields to one dimension creating a two dimensional plane(simplified) : The particle moves along the [FS] active axis in [FT] static time: The particle exists somewhere along the one dimensional [FS] active line depending on how the the field has been &quot;packed&quot;: The particle while moving along the [FS] active axis is also moving along the [FT] &quot;static&quot; axis so no time occurs. The detector stops momentum and &quot;collapses &quot; the field back into its multi dimensions and the particle appears on the detector:\r<br># 4 Say: the double split causes the plane to &quot;flip&quot;. The [FS] static/ [FT] active axis is now aligned between the gun and the  detector : The particle does not (???) along the The [FS] static/ [FT]  active axis but time exists: The [FS] &quot;active&quot; / [FT] static axis is aligned parallel to the detector. The detector will &quot;collapse&quot; the [FS] active / [FT] static axis to all its dimensions: Assuming the packing of dimensions follows a function although each actual  direction is packaged according to a probability function  the particle appears on the detector as per wave function, gap, chance of particle, gap , chance of particle etc.", "comment_date": "2019-12-04T01:09:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfred Ekblom", "comment_text": "This is actualy 7th grade fysics in sweden and the rest of the world", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T19:16:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madhuri Gautam", "comment_text": "Thanks Sir for demonstrating the interference experiment of light in such a nice way....it actually helped me a lot to understand much better....about the wave nature of light", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T11:32:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anand Kumar", "comment_text": "Sun image", "comment_date": "2019-12-01T20:25:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gopal Matcha", "comment_text": "Why does he sound like Ronald Weasley&#39;s dad?

Kathiriya\r<br>E-mail \u2013 sagar.kathiriya05@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com\r</a><br><br><br>This is theory to understand the quantum state of any particle at any time either it\u2019s observed by an observer or not. By this theory, we can understand \u201cwave-particle duality\u201d of nature. The Position of any quantum particle at any time is the result of deterministic trajectories that emerge from non-hidden Universal field disturbance (non-local, non-global it\u2019s Universal) made by that quantum particle itself. When quantum particle made a disturbance in that filed, ripples are generated from that filed and particle follow that trajectories because any particle with mass can\u2019t move faster than that ripples. That ripples travel at the speed of light. And so, every particle with mass must follow any of those trajectories that created by a ripple of Universal field. And so, what we find as Interference pattern is just a result of that ripples or wave trajectories that have been followed by quantum particle. The Final Position of any particle depends on size &amp; mass of that particle and It also depends on that Fields Intensity. If the field is stronger then we get more Intense Interference Pattern and if that fields Intensity is lower then we will get low Intense Interference pattern from the Double Slit Experiment. <br>So, the Only Question is what that non-hidden Universal field is? <br>First, it\u2019s everywhere in the Universe. <br>Second, it\u2019s not hidden. We already know almost everything about it and It\u2019s first of its kind.<br><br><br> It\u2019s Gravitational Filed.<br>To prove this theory we only have to perform the Double Slit Experiment in Deep Space. <br><br><br>And After all, if I\u2019m Correct then I only have to say just two things.<br>First, we live in reality and Our Universe is always there, it doesn\u2019t need our Observation. <br>Second. No, God does not play dice with the Universe.

That force can be used to power Solar Sails that work on solar light. Light can be curved by very high GRAVITY. That&#39;s all my 10yo brain knows.

It is found: (1) that real, narrow slits do not transmit all the incident light; (2) that the transmission losses increase when the depth of the slit is increased, and decrease when the conductivity (or reflectivity) of the slit walls is increased; (3) that when a slit is more than about half a wave-length wide, light polarized with its electric vector parallel to the slit is transmitted better than light polarized with its electric vector perpendicular to the slit, and that for either state of polarization the fraction of incident light transmitted increases as the wave-length is decreased; (4) that a slit less than half a wave-length wide transmits light polarized with its electric vector normal to the slit only, and that in such a slit the fraction of incident light transmitted increases as the wave-length is increased. It is shown that the existence and order of magnitude of all these effects may be predicted from the electromagnetic theory of light, and that some of them may be expected from a consideration of the older scalar wave theory.

For everyone who&#39;d like to read about it I will shortly explain it as best as I can:<br><br><b>Light</b> is made from, what people call <i>Photons</i> . Once scientists found light to have wave- and particle-characteristics, they wondered even harder what Light actually was. A wave? A particle? It can&#39;t be both, can it? To clarify they would shoot single Photons at that <i>double slit</i> and determine where and in what shape these would hit the sensor placed behind it. Take a break and think about what you would expect to happen.<br><br><b>Here</b> comes the first paradox: The photons showed up at the screen as small dots and not as the result of interfering waves like they did before, which seems to prove that they are particles. However, when repeating the same experiment many times the points of impact of the individual photons would form the same <i>wave pattern</i> as before. That means that the single photon must have behaved just like a wave, traveling through both slits to interfere with itself.<br>That left the scientists even more clueless. How can something that obviously hits the screen in form of a particle behave like a wave just before? How is it determined where the photon will hit? What would determine wether the photon behaved like a wave or like a particle? Can a single photon actually form a wave and travel through both slits? <br><br><b>To</b> answer these questions they build two sensors that would determine through which slit the photon would travel. When they repeated the experiment the individual photons always either traveled through the right or through the left slit and never through both. But something else changed aswell. When repeating the experiment many times and overlaying the points of impact they would no longer show the wave pattern. They would just show two stripes. The stripes that most people expected from the beginning anyways. <br><br><b>It</b> is almost as if the photons knew they were watched and therefor behaved differently to not violate the laws of nature.

So the photons, having almost no mass, but traveling at the time horizon, should collect mass relative to the surroundings that are not moving, and push it in front and losing it in the wake turbulence behind them, that creates this sort of a gravitational wave. This, ofcourse, could be measured by creating a double slit and letting the particle enter one slit while the wave hits both slits and creates an interference with itself.

If the two amplitudes have opposite signs, they will subtract to form a combined wave with a lower amplitude and sometimes canceling out completely as well. This is called destructive interference. <br><br>Sound travels in waves. You hear sound because waves hit your ear. Sound waves are similar to ocean waves (like again shown in this video).They both have a certain frequency. The frequency is measured in hertz, which is one cycle per second.

It is Not actually a Reflection but it is kind of inverted image but as we will see one through a Convex Lens rather than one from a Concave Mirror. If you do same Experiment with Tubelight you&#39;ll see a Bar of Light. So what actually happens is that Light from a Point Source, Say, On the Circumference of the Sun goes through the Hole/Slit its Ray falls On the Diametrically Opposite Point of the Image, thus creating a circle. But this works out only for Small Holes or Slits because the scope for the light rays to pass and the vibration of the waves make it effective, use a big enough hole and you Lost It. Why works with Slits too even when they&#39;re Uni-dimentional? The Answer is Heisenberg&#39;s Uncertainty Principle. In Case of tubelight you see semicircular sides for circular holes and angled for other shaped holes is because of lack of distance. So what actually causes this is explained by ratio of the Distance between them and size of hole. Sorry if I offended you but I love Science And Logic.

This video is only really relevant to what light is. Colors share different relationships with each other. The color blue is demonstrably not a wavelength of light, and there are many reasons to think this. The first is that colors have similarity properties that wavelengths don&#39;t have. The color blue is more similar to the color purple than the color yellow. These similarity properties are not shared by the properties of waves of light (supposing light is a wave or wavicle). The wavelength that corresponds with the color blue has no properties that make it more similar to the wavelength that corresponds to the color purple than the wavelength that corresponds with the color yellow. But we do know that what goes on in the brain when someone experiences the color blue is more similar to what goes on in the brain when someone experiences the color purple than what goes on in the brain when someone experiences yellow. Color is more in your head than out in reality. A second, and more obvious, reason is that you can experience colors in the absence of the corresponding wavelengths of light. You can have experiences of sounds and colors while sleeping without the corresponding exposure to the wavelengths of light that normally cause you to have such experiences. The reason why is that the same events can happen in the brain from other causes. So, again, color is not the same as wavelengths of light. At best, color might be identical to types of brain events (but this has other problems).

Assumption: when the &quot;bending&quot; of light from one doesn&#39;t reach the bending of the other - but what if the overlap is partial?<br><br>2) At what width do the slits stop behaving as a &quot;lens&quot; and start behaving as a hole?  Does this vary based on the distance to the other slit or the thickness of the material?<br><br>3) What about 3 (or more) slits?  Do they react as individual sets or is there a combined effect? (obviously, the slits will need to be close enough for the outer slits to work in the same way that a double slit would work)<br><br>Have these questions been addressed in follow up experiments?  I can intuit the &quot;expected&quot; answers but I believe that having these disproved may add further understanding to the overall behavior.<br><br>One procedure to begin the experiment:<br>- Use a similar setup, but place a graduated surface on the back so the widths of any image projected on it can be measured.<br>- Determine the minimum width for a single slit to produce an image.

In water the rarefractions are single points moving across a plane viewed from a top perspective but instead of forming a body of a circle, it produces single points where water meets up. In a 3 dimensional space, these positive interference points are actually due to the light coming in through a slight but still existentant third axis as depth in the points still exist. This is centered due to the fact that light doesn&#39;t only come in the left and right of the box but also through the top and bottom at different intervals. Since the sun isn&#39;t a single point in space and is also diffused into the atmosphere, the slits aren&#39;t ever hit at a perfect angle. There&#39;s no perfect slit representing the box. There&#39;s light coming from all different kinds of angles and with the rarefractions from the left and right edges of the slit there&#39;s also rarefractions from the top and the bottom aswell but not in the same manner. This is due to the concept of funneling. Not necessarily the diffusion of light waves but the actual concept of how when there&#39;s a source from not a singular point but instead a multi dimensional plane that when passed through a significantly smaller opening, the slit, and displayed with distance that the majority of the point will be centered. For example, take a sheet of graph paper and start with five dots on the top and go down ten spaces and five dots on the bottom. Sort of like this:<br>.....<br><br>.....<br><br>Now connect all of those dots in a manner of the first row to the second row. Light doesn&#39;t travel straight down. So you want to connect EVERY dot on the first row with EVERY dot on the second row. Now take two of your fingers and place them across in the middle like this:<br>. . . . .<br><br><br>--*  *---<br><br>. . . . .<br>The rays that your fingers cover up are the slit, or the opening. Although, depending on where your fingers are, light will end up hitting every single other point; each point furthest distance from the center will have less light waves coming through because the angle at which they have to is significantly increased. This shows up as a circle in on a two dimensional plot due to the fact that all of the light in the rarefractions that are already their are split amongst a space in a vertical dimension aswell and allowing light to funnel in.

Proof: In the delayed choice experiment, IF information regarding a photon&#39;s trajectory exists THEN a particle pattern appears, however IF the trajectory is unknowable, THEN it produces a wave pattern. The wave pattern indicates that both slits are traversed simultaneously by the photon, which is impossible. Since the quantum is the minimum unit of information possible which could be introduced into the system (universe), and since the the patterns are observable by anyone anywhere in said universe, the delayed choice experiment is proof that absolute motion is an illusion and that reality is a self processing hologram where space, time, matter, &amp; motion are the output phases of reflexive self-processing. Any counter-argument presuming absolute motion effectively states the particles do things like traverse both slits simultaneously, or go backwards in time to change course. The Quantum Zeno Effect resolves into a similar analysis. Bottom line: science has proven that reality is a fully self contained &amp; self processing information system.

BUT and your video sir, when observed, the result is a wave like pattern with colour(due to the spectrum of light from the sun). soooo it completely contradicts?

Light is a Particle when it has an observer and also being delivered as a Wave from its origin within nature. Light is the energy being released from accumulated &#39;energy&#39; of which an atom gives off after its being raised to a higher energetic state, from energy it had received, which raised the energy state of the atom originally from its rest state.<br><br>A Photon essentially is released from the atom when it ceases to be energized from an external source and it returns to its rest state. Conservation of Energy in this way is facilitated (likened to latent heat within the atmosphere in meteorology, energy moves through the universe in a flux and conserved manner...) Light is only a small part of the E-M Spectrum. Energy is matter accelerated to the speed of light squared. E=MC2 (sorry no Superscript in FB). In keeping with this thinking then, it would be understandable that prior to being emitted as a photon, the speed of electrons whirling from the matter being elevated to a higher state of energy had to be higher than the speed of light or at the speed of light at the time they were created through being released from the matter from where they were emitted.<br><br>Gravity pulling on light then, theoretically has the potential to slow light or to interact with light, similar to the barriers within the double slit experiment, Is this because WE observe this and therefore cause this to happen as we observe light being bent around stars while we are observing? If our being observers cause the wave function to change into a particle function in this case, are we not similarly unified with Gravity to this extent? The electron emits the photon... The electron too is suspected in &#39;going places&#39; unpredictably and returning from non-existence and also for being in two places at the same time as well as never being observed... period.

What I can state is I am an autodidact with a passion in the pursuit of the truth of light. \u00a0For the last three years I have been working in the field of solar power research. The questions I entertain daily are: What is light? How do we define it? Once it is &quot;defined&quot; how will that definition help serve Humanity?\u00a0<br><br>My perspective is there is no right or wrong answer, my intention is to understand what light is and maximize its potential in technology. From my experiences the challenge with the means and methods of empirical evidence is can I trust my eyes to guide me to the definitive answer? Is light a phenomenon that specifically stimulates the rods and cones in the back of my retinas? Or is light far more expansive and diverse in nature? And am I limiting my understanding of light through visual interpretation alone?\u00a0<br><br>Here is an experiment that offers us another experience of &quot;light&quot;. Close your eyes and apply firm pressure with your fingers onto both eyes for two minutes, what happens? Within a minute you will begin to see contrasting patterns emerging. Is this light? Neural impulse interactions? What could this be? How do I explain with my eyes closed that even in the &quot;darkness&quot; emerges contrasting patterns of light and dark?<br><br>Other considerations are the many optical illusions that &quot;trick&quot; our eyes into &quot;seeing&quot; something, but in fact is skillfully crafted to be something entirely different. Many a magician profit wondrously from optical illusions. So if we understand our visual interpretation can be tricked than how do we know the double slit experiment is a \u201ctrue\u201d observation or an optical illusion?<br><br>More on the limitations of the double \u201cslit\u201d experiment, for now let\u2019s review the ideas light as a wave, particle or wave/particle sandwich.<br><br>First challenge, the observation of the wave.<br><br>An analogy early scientists have utilized to describe light are through the observation of the undulating patterns of the surface tension of water. We observe wavelike patterns when we interact with the surface tension of this liquid. And have adopted words like &quot;interference patterns&quot; and &quot;cancelation&quot; between the interactions of peaks and troughs to define the observations. What I question is how is it that we can assume a sine/cosine function relative to fluid dynamics is also a means to define the behaviour of light? I am not questioning the physics of this observation, it is real, it has its place, but who made it the definitive conclusion light behaves like water? Again comparing peaks and troughs, sine/cosine functions. So we are saying light can be thoroughly defined by a rise and fall on a x and y axis? Really? Come on!!!<br><br>Second challenge, the theory light is a \u201cparticle\u201d.\u00a0<br><br>I state theory because a particle is a word loosely defined by science. Defined as a small localized object primarily utilized effectively in the world of physical and chemical properties. I am in total agreement in its usage, however to define \u201clight\u201d as a particle is in my humble opinion, an assumption. I won\u2019t bore you with the history of photovoltaic process other than it was documented around 1839 and has remained a curiosity of many brilliant minds ever since.<br><br>In my experiences studying the photovoltaic effect for a number of years I can state we are still in the infancy of truly harnessing the power of the sun. Why? Due to the uncertainty of what light is. How is it the major bodies of science have varying opinions on the nature of light and yet have the ability to create \u201cstandards\u201d. For example the standard that Sunlight on its best day on Earth produces 1000 watts per square meter. Amazing how the \u201cSun\u201d gave us such a wonderful round number of 1000! Wonderous, thank you Sun for keeping it so simple! :-)<br><br>When we truly understand the nature of light a technology exposed to one hour of Sunlight will power entire cities. Yes call me crazy, and embracing the hidden dangers of optimism, but seriously folks modern science defines the photovoltaic \u201cevent\u201d as:<br><br>1.) The \u201cabsorption\u201d of a photon creates an electron-hole pair.<br>2.) A minority carrier called a \u201chole\u201d makes it across the junction, and becomes a majority carrier.<br>3.) After the hole passes through a load (e.g. a light bulb), the electron meets up with the hole and completes the circuit.<br><br>In layman terms a \u201cphoton\u201d defined as a elementary particle, \u201cknocks\u201d electrons loose from a substance, for a brief moment the electron creates a \u201chole\u201d, divorce papers are filed, mediation takes place with resistance (our load), a little bit of time living on their own the electron, and the electron hole start thinking about each other, listening to Michael McDonald\u2019s song \u201cI keep forgetting we\u2019re not in love anymore\u201d. They start to feel the pull to come back together, realizing the atomic dating scene is terribly complicated, and then magically they are back together\u2026 until another flat bellied electron home wrecker (aka the Photon) comes along and starts the whole process all over again. (ahem)<br><br>The wave/particle sandwich challenge, the Photon.<br><br>As already mentioned, that is (trumpets blaring), the Photon. The Photon previously described as an \u201celementary particle\u201d. By its very definition is a convolution of terms. A logical approach to the semantics of this word phrase \u201celementary\u201d meaning something simple and basic, and \u201cparticle\u201d a word loosely defined by science. This then translates to Light as \u201ca simple version of a particle.\u201d I totally get it! Wow! Hmmm, nope I am more confused than ever\u2026.<br><br><br>I want to apologize to photovoltaic experts whom perhaps at this moment are contemplating preparing a very elaborate highly detailed explanation proving me wrong, and most likely state I\u2019m an arrogant uneducated derelict who knows nothing of the photovoltaic process. I can accept that, you\u2019re right, I\u2019m not an expert nor do I have a degree in this field of science.<br><br>If I may ask why is it that in 1960 solar cell efficiency was 14%, 54 years (that\u2019s fifty four years) later one sun solar cells have just recently achieved 19% efficiency?\u00a0<br><br>To the credit of multi-junction technology it is currently at 44%, however there are exorbitant costs to manufacture this technology.<br><br>But, I digress\u2026<br><br>My intention with my rant is to offer an opportunity to humbly ask, what if the current definition of Light and the photovoltaic processes are inaccurate?<br><br>What if Science has yet to truly understand what light is, and has been struggling to improve a much needed technology to surpass the cost per watt barrier of coal, gas and oil?<br><br><br>Returning to the double slit experiment limitation.<br><br>Let us marvel at its genius, its simplicity, and awe inspiring method to observe a mind blowing visual phenomenon that leaves us more in the dark about light.<br><br>Science as we have come to understand it relates to the practice of documented observations of nature. Since the dawn of the written word itself curiosities of nature have been discussed, debated, and even plagiarized to obtain notoriety and stature. A new entertainment was born in the early societies as to what culture had the smartest nerds on campus. A political agenda emerged, and in some cases used as leverage to claim one society as \u201cmore advanced\u201d than others. Offering the conclusion we are superior therefore have the right to declare we are at the top of food chain and you are the inferior species.<br><br>A moral corruption in science ran rampant in the 1800\u2019s. Brilliant minds who were the true disciples of science were manipulated, ripped off by political tyrants of their time. Words were misinterpreted from their original meanings. For example the word electric from the Latin electricus was originally defined as \u201clike amber\u201d as described by English scientist William Gilbert. Even the Greek word \u201celektron\u201d also referred to the material amber. Another Greek word \u201cAtomos\u201d defined as \u201cindivisible\u201d, and yet science continues to this day to dissect the atom into smaller and smaller \u201cparticles\u201d.<br><br>This brief topic of history of science sets the stage for questioning the validity of the double slit experiment with the following question.<br><br>Why did Thomas Young make the assumption a \u201cslit\u201d would be the judge and jury to define light?\u00a0<br><br>Tell me where in Nature is there a naturally occurring straight line or rectangle for that matter?\u00a0<br><br>I am sure Euclid introducing his works \u201cThe Elements\u201d was rolling in his grave when Sir Thomas Young made this assumption. That two small rectangles will define the nature of light.<br><br>In order to understand Nature we must learn to recognize the nature of Nature.\u00a0<br><br>We are literally hundreds of years off track from the misinterpretations of the nature of Nature.\u00a0<br><br>And what of women scientists? I am sure there were many brilliant women scientists who in my opinion have an innate relationship with Nature that man will never comprehend.<br><br>So where do we begin to answer this question what is light?<br><br>Let\u2019s start with trees, and their highly efficient process of photosynthesis.<br><br>Let\u2019s study the anatomy of the eye revealing there are no relationship to lines, mathematics, and the theory of \u201csymmetry\u201d.<br><br>Anyways, in the event you have made it this far I thank you.<br><br>I have a vision where Humanity is free from oil, gas and coal.\u00a0<br><br>That when we have looked deeply within ourselves to pursue the truth of the nature of light we will discover it is a personal journey for each of us.<br><br>Once enough brilliant minds come together who understand the nature of light, amazing solar technologies will emerge.<br><br>And please I beg you, in less you have personally experimented with light, and photovoltaics with your own eyeballs do not trust our predecessors and their \u201ctheories\u201d.<br><br>Discover for yourself the Nature of light.", "comment_date": "2014-10-26T06:21:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "j", "comment_text": "I knew :3", "comment_date": "2014-10-25T08:37:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trigger Say", "comment_text": "It is round because it is a particle.

The positron which is the antiparticle equivalent of the electron carries a +1 mass and a Positive Charge. It has a clockwise spin and the electron carries a -1 mass and a Negative Charge. The electron has a counter clockwise spin. When an electron is attracted to a positron the two annihilate each other, an produce a single photon of 0 mass and zero charge. Thus, the Photon which is the only Particle capable of traversing distances at 299,792,458 meters/second is in reality not a particle at all. Physics will soon find that the Photon is among the smallest of reactions produced by positively charged particles interacting with negatively charged ones. The interference pattern created by the two balls you excited in the water demonstrate the interference patterns in relative space/time of the Positron annihilating the electron and vice versa. The result in this instant is among the tiniest of point space phenomenon. In my studies i have dubbed this wave/particle phenomenon a 3 p event or Point particle phenomenon. Simply put the attraction or affinity for the positron to attract the electron can occur on all spectrum&#39;s of the EM field. The Electron is a presence in all Matter no matter what we observe. The positron is a \u00a0highly charged, \u00a0high energy state particle that traverses through out space/time in the form of a &quot;WAVE&quot; to eventually meet up with its antiparticle twin the universally abundant electron. Once this wave we of positrons reaches its twin antiparticle, like yin and yang they annihilate each other thus giving quantum physics a wonderful phenomenon to behold. For it is only after the two have annihilated each other that the speeds, frequencies and wavelengths of such particles can be seen to create disruptive troughs and crests in which the instantaneous release of gamma ray energy is converted into a 0 mass 0 charge point partial particle known as the PHOTON which then can diverge even further into both wavelengths of observation and a band \u00a0of seemingly dot matrix like particles at the same \u00a0time. There is no magic going on here. Science has just misunderstood the event for which are taking place. The Photon is neither a particle nor a wave. It is the result of a high energy particle &quot;the gamma ray emitted Positron&quot; annihilating its twin cousin the quantum field electron. Both being particles of a type. The electron is a Potential Energy particle. And the positron is a kinetic energy particle. Being opposite in both ways think of the two twin particles like two spheres. The reason electrons appear to be in more places than 1 at any given time is because we are literally observing plausibility or potentiality at its lowest level of existence, the quantum level. The reason electrons jump here than there than over there is because they do not actually represent a form of matter that defines any 3 dimensional rule of physical space. The only reason they can be seen to be anywhere at all is due to the positive charge that a proton has bounded upon them from inside the nucleus of the Atom. And it is this positive charge that keeps these little intangible potential states of energy known as the &quot;electron&quot; in some environment of stability to await \u00a0their trans-configuration from which the tangible positron will eventually aid in. So long story short an electron is an empty box, a positron is a completely filled up cube that fits inside that box completely flush and upon the interaction of the potential with the kinetic you get the interference pattern witnessed and the obliteration of the electron and positron as physics knows it to produce the &quot;PHOTON&quot; which is neither a particle nor a wave. A photon is an interaction between the two particles that created it. And from that interaction we can get the entire spectrum of interruption patterns which then create the broad spectrum of light we see with the naked eye and even the spectrum we cannot see with our eyes.This is why physics is confounded by this interaction because they cannot seem to understand it for what it really is.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-05-12T11:31:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GrooveThumper", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty sure the simple answer to why the interference pattern was circular is that the light source was circular.", "comment_date": "2014-05-12T09:02:12Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Tommy Thai", "comment_text": "Light isn&#39;t only a wave, it&#39;s a particle too.

Instead, the only way to explain this phenomenon physically is to say that the world momentarily splits into two around the photons for an infinitely short amount of time.", "comment_date": "2014-04-21T22:57:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Sanderson", "comment_text": "dude your channel is blowing my mind", "comment_date": "2014-04-21T00:48:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JonPod Vandam", "comment_text": "is the answer Heisenberg&#39;s Uncertainty Principle?", "comment_date": "2014-04-20T19:31:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim K", "comment_text": "Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.

Rationally, you can assume that one photon at a time will not interfere with anything since there is no other photon to cancel it out. But pass one photon at a time, adding one point of light to the surface at a time, the pattern emerges again. This indicates that ONE PHOTON APPEARS TO PASS THROUGH BOTH SLITS AT THE SAME TIME.

It&#39;s called\u00a0Lumium. It&#39;s found in all materials and looks like a Hydrogen atom only it has a lone neutron for a nucleus instead of a proton. This makes it negatively\u00a0charged and so it has a tendency to repel away from its source at high velocity and continuing until it bonds with another material. The hotter a material is, the more of these will be released and so the light produced will be brighter and of a higher wavelength.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like all elements, Lumium is affected by gravity and often clumps together in large groups, being slowly released over time. We call these clumps stars. Lumium has the same relative atomic mass and electron configuration as Hydrogen which is why people would mistakenly have you believe that stars are in fact made of that. But seriously, if that were true than stars would end their life as a huge cloud of steam.\u00a0<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thermal radiation is also a myth based on\u00a0common misconception surrounding Lumium.\u00a0Things get warm when you leave them in the sun because\u00a0Lumium\u00a0starts to saturate an object and so has to diffuse more\u00a0quickly to balance out the concentration gradient.\u00a0This process of\u00a0removing excess Lumium from an object is known as Illumination and is exothermic. This reaction is reversible and its opposite reaction, Lumination, is endothermic. This is\u00a0why air higher up is\u00a0colder. It has bonded with more Lumium from the sun and has\u00a0absorbed more heat.\u00a0Obviously further away from the source of light not only will less Lumium hit the object but much of it will bond with the air, reducing the\u00a0concentration gradient between the object and its surroundings leading to a slower illumination process. The rate at which illumination or lumination occurs within a given material is referred to as its Luminosity.\u00a0<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negative charge of Lumium is also why things tend to give you a shock if you touch them after they&#39;ve been in the sun a while. In fact, electricity is simply the potential difference of Lumium between two points. When\u00a0a current is produced in a wire Lumium constantly breaks and reforms bonds with the surrounding materials, which results in a net movement along the wire. This movement of Lumium can be amplified by increasing the\u00a0amount of material in\u00a0a given space,\u00a0which is how electric motors and generators work. Obviously the breaking bonds produce heat which is why wires get hot when a current passes through them. Transition metals allow Lumium to travel through a wire much more smoothly than other elements, particularly Silver and Copper, and so these are used most often in wires.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Light bulbs work by emitting Lumium from a wire filament very quickly. The filament is made of a Tungsten-Lumium alloy called Magnitudite and his surrounded by a highly concentrated\u00a0inert gas: Argon Brightase. This\u00a0gas replenishes the supply of Lumium in the wire but eventually it\u00a0depletes all of its Lumium\u00a0and the bulb blows. When a material has expended all of its Lumium it is known as having been Delighted. New proprietary technology known at LEDs, Lumium Emitting Diodes, work by absorbing Lumium from the air around it then emitting it again at a higher frequency. These last much longer and, because of the illuminated air that undergoes lumination and absorbs heat, produce less heat.<br>\u00a0\u00a0 So remember, light is an element, and we are all illuminating, so think about that next time you&#39;re feeling like you don&#39;t affect the world around you.", "comment_date": "2014-04-10T20:26:57Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Dania Flores", "comment_text": "Hes so attractive..\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-10T19:24:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ARMOR LEBIHAN", "comment_text": "light is energy without mass. particle and waveform as part of electromagnetic field... light is fundamentaly QUANTIC.. study of the light as introduce einstein to is Relative general theroy and then from this point came the Quantic theory thats says LIGHT IS BOTH .

If you make the hole bigger, you get a brighter image which is less focused. Since the hole is usually round and the sun is spherical causing any full image of it to be round, an image of the sun is a good way to experiment with why and how the image blurs with the use of a larger hole.

But I what nags at my brain is why can&#39;t light be some odd mixture of both. IDK like a particle that behaves like a wave. It would easily, at least for me, explain the rounded off edge question. Because if that were the case then I think that would be the result of diffusion and indirect Light if those aren&#39;t different stages of the same event. I mean in the art realm we learn a lot of cool sciency things often times without even realizing it. The biggest example I can site that influences me to question this is stippling. Which is the use of dots to illustrate an image. When done by someone that has mastered this technique it can even give the illusion of color when in reality it is simply tiny black dots on a lighter background. I think pixel-ization illustrates this to some degree too. In how it uses only the primary colors and different illumination intensities to create the amazing photos etc. we all share with one another. I think one would maybe need a more detailed definition of what a wave is. To most people I think the view it like a ribbon or a sheet. Without ever thinking about the fact that water and air (the most common associations when talking about a waves) are not solids or rather a single body. They are coalitions of elements reacting to their environments. Oh and just to say it I am not science literate so any misused terminology please excuse.
