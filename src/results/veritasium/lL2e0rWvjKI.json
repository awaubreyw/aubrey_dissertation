Modern measurement refinements have changed that in the 5th decimal place, but 1g/ml is still plenty close. 1000 ml is a liter, so that has a mass of 1 kg, which weighs about 2.2 lbs. At 3.8 liters per U.S. gallon, a gallon is about 8.4 pounds (near freezing). 4% less dense near boiling, makes it very close to 8.0. At body temperature of 37 Celsius (98.6 F.), we&#39;re in the middle, just above 8 lbs per gallon, around 1 pound per pint.<br><br>There&#39;s a very old cooking shorthand which says &quot;a pint&#39;s a pound the world around&quot;. Our bodies are about 70% water, which makes them pretty close to the same density as water. The same approximate rule holds true for most food stuffs, which tend to have similar proportions. Even dry goods are derived from plant stuffs, and tend to retain a density somewhere in that ball park. Weigh a pint of flour sometime. That old rule of thumb wasn&#39;t bad for having originated without instrumentation. It simply served to get you closer on average.<br><br>Back to the video. He lost 1.5 kg from going to the bathroom. 3.3 lbs. A bit more than 3 pints, if it was all water. Young and healthy, not having to arise during the night, the body has all night to produce that much, and one can hold it that long. (Consider that his lunch was also 1.5 kg, so that&#39;s not so huge a measure of waste.)<br><br><br>I don&#39;t find those readings to be any surprise. I&#39;ve had to track my weight daily for many years, and I&#39;ve experienced similar effects often. I&#39;ve even gained 6 pounds in a day, virtually all of it water, retained due to swelling under adverse conditions. Lost it all in two days shortly after. So variances of 3-4 pounds during a day are not unusual, and significantly more is definitely possible under various conditions.<br><br>Makes sense that after the bathroom first thing in the morning you&#39;d be at a day&#39;s low point. In my experience, that&#39;s the most scientifically accurate time and way to weigh also, as it tends to regularize all the other variables that might influence your weight during the day, leaving a dependable baseline. Weight watchers will also appreciate being able to measure at the low point.

The first paragraph from friggin Wikipedia: &quot;In physics, mass\u2013energy equivalence is the concept that the mass of a body or system is a measure of its energy content. In particular, any physical system has a property called energy and a corresponding property called mass; the two properties are always present in the same (i.e. constant) proportion to one another.&quot;", "comment_date": "2013-07-14T21:03:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Goodbrake", "comment_text": "You do lose a tiny amount of mass-energy by radiating away heat, but the source of that energy isn&#39;t the mass of the food you eat but the energy associated with the chemical bonds in the food.
