You said you could consider an isotope with more neutrons heavier, but didn&#39;t really give that context. Which I mean, its not really your job to do that, I just think it would be cool and beneficial. What I mean by context is, for example, what does changing the weight of a Hydrogen atom do? does that cause it to have different physical behavior? What about an Iron atom, or a Carbon atom; is the behavioral changes (if any) between isotopes consistent across elements? In other words, does changing the weight of Hydrogen have the same behavioral affect (again, if any) of making the same change to Iron and Carbon?", "comment_date": "2018-03-05T05:29:16Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Uzair Ali", "comment_text": "Omg... no offense to those guys in the public but they are  NOOBS", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T23:23:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "school boy", "comment_text": "He is cool and smart", "comment_date": "2017-11-05T07:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhilan", "comment_text": "Damn communist wearing a Che Guevara shirt", "comment_date": "2017-10-15T04:25:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ios game", "comment_text": "I love this video im not a suceur", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T10:46:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kindle", "comment_text": "Proton is positively charged and electron is negatively charged, so why they don&#39;t collide?", "comment_date": "2017-08-30T14:44:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shekhar Singh", "comment_text": "thank you for describing briefly on isotopes", "comment_date": "2017-04-23T00:40:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shubham singh", "comment_text": "ultimate", "comment_date": "2017-04-10T19:32:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akshta Arora", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDaOigLBTU&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a> dat expression though!", "comment_date": "2017-04-06T06:33:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KeshDogga", "comment_text": "Baby Veritasium!!!!
