But their rank as a robot is controlled with no free choice but absolute instinct dominates them.<br><br> After all, a real benefit from a father to his son is nothing but that the son rises and grows according to the rank of his father and even above him. We were to conquer nature just like the one who created it. And not when judging and living a dog and a cat.<br><br>If so the solution<br>Is not in increasing the hatred from which it is not lacking and will never be lacking because that is how it has been imprinted on us from the day of birth<br>(Media you do a very bad job just a pity a lot of beatings along the way !!!!)<br><br>Nor in the abolition of hatred because it is power is in nature and should not be abolished.<br><br>But only in the addition of love and connection and oneness addition upon addition while being aware of the process.<br><br>The people of Israel will wake up !!! Followed by the whole world !!!!!<br><br>Nature (G-d) requires connection and oneness and if not, he has every means to educate man and humanity until his surrender.<br> He will not rest or sleep until the purpose of creation is completed.<br>To do good to creatures.<br>Come, O Bnei Yisrael, you are the first to realize this study !!!!!!!!<br>And when you know, you will teach your brothers the peoples of the world.<br><br>This is called light to the Gentiles.<br> And this is a job we do not deserve at all in the meantime.<br><br>&quot;For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples!&quot;<br><br>Love friends only love.

With these velocities they make 90 degree turns like a pingpong ball bouncing of a wall. The public should look into these studies and all the data.

I could not get similar flashes to occur when snapping my fingers, I guess because the noise that follows is an expected noise.  It is possible that the flashes were be due to the release of small bits of radiation released when electricity starts to flow through a circuit, but it does not explain the flashes seen after unexpected outdoor noises not related to electronics.
