(or at the very least we can state. to the best of our knowledge). that does not mean THAT specific instance of infinite is populated. is merely means its canvas exists (space not technically existing, also means we don&#39;t even know that). What we do know is. every action has an opposite and equal reaction. (balance). what we do know energy cannot be created nor destroyed. and nothing can exist spontaneously (this defies, every action has an opposite and equal reaction). which leaves only 1 other option. in the beginning God said. let there be light (energy). not to be confused with the sun (stars). the creation of the stars occurred after. (the sun is a star) we know that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. (e=mc2). so when the lord said. let there be light. he populated the canvas which is space. with energy. (the big bang). its not coincidence that it cannot be measured. it just exceeds our potential of understanding. our minds are finite and limited. we cannot understand a paradox like (it is but isn&#39;t). The Old Testament is the original Hebrew Bible, the sacred scriptures of the Jewish faith, written at different times between about 1200 and 165 BC. yet it describes an event that we to this day cannot describe. with detail we cannot have possibly known. the forming of the planets and the stars was merely a conversion of energy to matter. as they are interchangeably the same thing. energy cannot be created nor destroyed. but we have a book over 2000 years old that describes the big bang while not a single person in existence had any pretense of the existence of the concept. perspective is a funny thing. universe was designed and has a purpose. the purpose is to contain creation. the alternative is a flat world concept where you could fall off when you reach the end. and fall off to where? if nothing other than it exists. or ask yourself the million dollar questions. there was light. and then stars. isn&#39;t the sun a star? so its obviously not the light. Einstein &quot;big idea&quot; suggested that 1 single paperclip contains the same energy as either a ton of TNT or a small nuclear warhead. when we split the atom we merely separated the elements. we still have not created nor destroyed anything. the energy released is mediocre compared to the energy contained within the matter itself. and with the amount of matter in existence. its just frankly impossible for it to exist if not created by something infinite. or the alternative is you have a immeasurable amount of energy existing out of the blue for no reason. some say they are men of science. some say they are men of religion. if you think those to are separate things. your perspective is lacking. the bible proves science as much as science proves the bible. time is constant, when it is constant. that doesn&#39;t make it constant. space is infinite (as far as we know) but technically doesn&#39;t exist (its is. but isn&#39;t). paradox&#39;s that are intentionally part of the design. because it is necessary. to say we haven&#39;t solved gravity. is an understatement.", "comment_date": "2022-04-27T14:26:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0424\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043f\u043f \u041b\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439", "comment_text": "If you&#39;re talking about GR, the words &quot;gravitational potential&quot; are quite misleading", "comment_date": "2022-04-24T11:24:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Madeo", "comment_text": "The satellites are also increasing and decreasing in speed due to the elliptical orbit.

The first part measuring a clock isolated within the machine and it&#39;s ticking vs clock on Earth is always bound to the frequency of the signal send and the medium that it is sending through. So a signal sent across the sky of a certain distance could end up being redshifted. Sending it through certain amount of atmosphere versus through another amount. I admit I&#39;m a skeptic and I believe that the perspective of a signal being sent from a farther distance verses witnessing both clocks if somehow possible it comes down to the accuracy of the signal. As long as you can tell me that the radiation in the atmosphere or the atmosphere itself the band of light that transfers doesn&#39;t change just because of how far away it is but also because of. The farther away you are from an atmosphere the atmosphere seems more dense because for every millimetre that you&#39;re looking at there is more stuff for you to look through. Kind of like if you were to try to see down into the Mariana Trench it gets harder and harder to see because of density and really what is happening here feels more like that then time dilation. It feels like it&#39;s a kind of density and by going out farther the clock has just a different amount of stuff between it and the sensor on Earth then it does when it&#39;s closer. We will better understand gravitational effects when we work with the moon and there is no atmosphere to combat us. Another question is if you are able to use light as a type of sale then why not use that light to move the satellite into a better position simply by rotating the mirrors every specific times? You use no propellant. Also I still wonder why there aren&#39;t some sort of plants that you can use Odin space in order to achieve some more up something. Back to the topic. Acceleration forces the atomic particles to sort of lag behind. That&#39;s a force that has nothing to do with time. I would love to one day be proven wrong that time is unaffected by speed or Mass at all. But the forces are based on inertia and buoyancy and are actually easy to understand.<br>.<br>Someone suggested the time move in different directions is the reason why planets and stars and almost anything likes to spin. As anything moves through another medium it will wants to move backwards but if the pressure is less on the other side then it will end up in a spin and this has to do if atmosphere not time. Almost any ball in order to move forward on a floor needs to roll and I have zero to do if time similarly forces affecting an object out in space force it to roll it has nothing to do with time. This is my understanding. I&#39;m not worried that at some point in time the miscalculation of time and things is going to lead to some cataclysm for some terrible event. But if we keep on chasing the idea that if we move faster and faster that like Superman going faster makes us go backwards in time so we can save Lois Lane, that would make that a science fact story if it happened that way. I have received no information of testing leading to this conclusion because most everyone accelerates to the speed near the speed of light and not going past it. What major concern about going backwards through time while you moving forward through space that space is moving forwards while the rest of you is moving towards where space was and therefore technically would end up out in space War for the planet and hit something miles away unintended. But if going faster doesn&#39;t put you backwards in time because of course it shouldn&#39;t even though that&#39;s what every scientist currently believes accept me so it seems. If going faster just keeps on making you go forwards in time, If gravity has no effect on the time of an object. And it is interesting that you and I can come to similar measurements based on the effects of the environment but I feel no effect whatsoever is happening with time. This is something that we would understand a lot with signals coming from distances as far as Mars and Venus and Pluto we would have all sorts of data. And the lack of time function would then seem obvious but if there is a Time function you would think it would be compounded. What about if an orbit is going in the opposite direction of the rotation of the Earth verses in the same direction? Whether or not I&#39;m a believer of the truth that theme for all the data isn&#39;t very important because I&#39;m just one person not affecting the system. But if somehow my intuition about time having nothing to do with any of this and it&#39;s the rest of them that are misunderstanding the governing systems? Give me a Nobel Prize if I&#39;m right. I&#39;ll be around my 50s when you guys figure it out maybe. Unless I&#39;m wrong. But I&#39;ve been saying this for years. There are many things that could affect the clock, the signal.

Bonney", "comment_text": "G rel is just the mathematical representation of a real classical physics phenomenon. The MM experiment is flawed because the unscientific &#39;assumption&#39; that mirrors reflect at c was made. False. Mirrors absorb and re-emit light at C+V and C-V with V being the velocity of the object through the universe. That&#39;s called light speed anisotropy and acellerative reference frames are not a problem with that physics. Looking for an ether was misguided. There is no ether or rather it is a universal reference frame that allows galaxies to travel faster than C at the edge of the universe. This also allows for the speed of say earth through space to not be measurable by the MM experiment. However light in fibres and radio waves in coaxial cables do show anisotropy.<br>Maxwell made a mistake when he assumed that charge flows instantaneously onto a plate when charging it. This is the first falsity that ~even though Maxwell still calculated c~ resulted in Lorentz etc. Maxwell&#39;s charge actually travels to the plate at c like all good electrons in an electrical circuit do. Maxwell&#39;s experiment was being carried out on an earth travelling at great speed through the universe and he still arrived at c. That seemed strange to Lorentz et al which led to further thought regarding moving objects and the speed of light.<br>Having said that Lorentz was wrong in his reasoning about charges needing to travel instantaneously, or else an atom at high speed would leave them behind unless they could somehow orbit faster than c. However by some good fortune his math resulted in the relativities which are fair analogues of the classical physics involved so there is no reason to redo physics at all. Just be aware that the mathematics is not causality. That would be rather foolish right?<br>I have actually readdressed the physics in a 1300 page tome but It is of no use.

Can there not be other explanations? Just because the explanation of general relativity describes the phenomenon accurately doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s the right explanation, just that it fits accurately.<br><br>What if... a gravitational field slows the mechanical movement of the smallest scale bits of matter in such a way that it acts indistinguishable from a slowing of time. Everything we could possibly use to make the measurement is effected by the density curve of gravity, but time itself is a constant. Or time is an illusion, an emergent property of the fundamental movement of the smallest, constituent parts of our universe.<br><br>I think it is foolish to assert that just because general relativity accurately describes a phenomenon it means it has to be the actual explanation for it. We haven&#39;t proven general relativity... We&#39;ve proven a phenomenon occurs. That&#39;s the data. How were interpret the data matters because we have based so much on the assumption of that interpretation.<br><br>To then further complicate things, we educate others that that assumption is fact, when in fact, we could be wrong.<br><br>And when the theory meshes perfectly up to that last .001% of data, we then assume that something must be missing in the data that still makes the theory work instead of leaving room for the entire theory to be wrong.  With limited data on every phenomenon possible, multiple theories and the math that expresses them could fit the picture but only one is the right one.<br><br>So I say, don&#39;t stop asking what if, and leave room for your interpretation of the data to be completely wrong.

Time is nothing more then a measurement of motion\u00a0, Not\u00a0a \u00a0dimension and as such\u00a0is easily manipulated by large gravity wells such as planets , stars , etc. Everything that has mass is effected by gravity including the little parts like protons , neutrons , electrons and even the smaller parts of quantum physics . While exposed to higher gravity these parts experience resistance and thus slow down and when not exposed to large amounts of gravity they speed up . That&#39;s why the illusion of time dilation exist when observing this phenomenon at great distance but does not exist when observed at close range . Ie. You are at that time experiencing the same gravitational forces as the object being observed therefore unable to perceive the illusion of time dilation . \u00a0 For example ; imagine if you will shooting a gun strait up { not recommended btw } while standing on earth . the bullet has resistance therefore it is moving slower then if\u00a0that same gun were to be shot in space 5000 miles from earth . The same thing happens at the atomic level , the atoms inside your own body . The result of this is the speeding up or slowing down of our human perception which is the only cause of the illusion of time dilation .\u00a0 In short time is not experiencing dilation of any sort . However our perception of it is distorted . Coincidentally this very simple explanation also explains why time and or our perception of it become distorted at very high speeds as well . This is caused by the maximum speed of the universe , roughly 187 thousand miles per second . The closer you get to that speed the more all the little and very fast parts are forced to slow down . Once again distorting the perception of this measurement we call time . \u00a0And last thing\u00a0I&#39;d like to say is that of course this is just a theory also and will not be able to be proven until we develop technologies that allow us to travel close to the speed of light . NOT THAT WE WOULD EVER WANT TO GO THAT FAST FOR ANY REASON . Because\u00a0at that speed , no matter the size of your ship , if you hit a space rock the size of a baseball it would completely destroy any ship that you could build . So game over and no at that speed mass does not become infinite but energy does .

What if i could blow your mind by making gravity... the same thing as time.<br><br><br><br>Gravity is not a force, its the effect of time dilation. Time/Gravity at my feet, is slower/stronger than the time/gravity at my head.  This difference pulls objects to the slower time frame.  This is also why gravity can not be included with quantum theory as time/gravity does not exist at that small of a scale unless you are in a black hole.  This is also why gravity appears weak compared to the other fundamental forces and does not belong with Electromagnetism.<br><br>The universe is made up of bubbles of time organized like onions with billions and billions of layers(speed of time), these time bubbles are created by matter and we call them atoms, elements, galaxies, solar systems, planets, black holes, ect anything that is matter creates a time bubble that combines with the time bubbles of other things nearby. This is a universe of bubbles within bubbles.<br><br>Earth has a time bubble around it extending to as far as its effect, gravity reaches Time moves slower the closer you are the the earth and faster as you get further away.  Earth however is inside the sun time bubble and due to this leaving earths time bubble leave you at the default time frame for being a certain distance from the sun, as you go further out from the sun time again begins speeding up.  The sun however is inside the Sagittarius A star time bubble (our galaxy) therefor leaving the solar system to free space gives you a default time frame for being a certain distance from the center of the galaxy.  Leaving the galaxy, in the voids between galaxy clusters does time even exist? <br><br>Einstein said it... people just are not listening anymore.  Relativity explains dark matter as... not real and not needed.  The reason galaxies spin faster than the &quot;gravity&quot; would allow without flying apart, is not ... an invisible matter creating more gravity.  Its that as you move out from the center in galaxies time moves faster and faster.  We are not accounting for the time dilation as you move out to the edges or move inwards.  We see objects in our time frame, however their physics work in their time frame and it appears faster from our perspective.  Further out solar systems from the core are traveling at the proper speeds according to their own time frame, which to us appears much faster so the physics appears much too fast. <br><br>When we look out into the galaxy we need to stop just looking at objects in our time frame...  we need to find the time frame of the thing we are looking at and compare it to our time frame to work out what the object is really doing. <br><br>Science got stuck when it came to dark matter and its now taught in schools.

Imagine two identical spring driven clocks, however once having been synchronized now the clock dials have diverged measures of time due to time dilation effect. The clock dials diverged position corresponds to a divergent position of clock springs. Define the clock springs divergent position in terms of Hooke&#39;s law which equates to divergent values of force/tension for each spring.<br><br>So clocks springs empirically demonstrate force dilation. Question is, does the modulated rate of atomic clocks correspond to force dilation? Atomic clocks rely on an electromagnetic process (a fundamental force) and therefore time dilation effect is definable as a modulated rate of EM force. <br><br>Modulated atomic forces provide a prospective solution for anomalous galaxy rotation velocity. Mass is equivalent to sum of atomic forces, and atomic forces are modulated by gravity, dependent upon square law proximity to mass. Factor star population densities, dilate atomic force/mass.

Voyagers after all ARE STILL going, Hubble (even after a slight error in the mirror) still show us things that are unimaginable after a quick fix!!! So to me ESA can&#39;t seem to deliver most of their own stuff into space where in the US it just &quot;works&quot; every time and built to last forever!! And yet now the liberals want us in America to be more like Europe, WHY??????????? Think about it seriously here!! We have a probe that just surveyed Pluto and is STILL working in the asteroid belt, two rovers on Mars that have out lived their missions, two space probes built in the 1970s still sending us data from interstellar space in both Voyagers so why is it America needs to depend on Russia or even Europe for anything is beyond me when our space program used to be a billion times better than anybody else&#39;s?! Sure NASA has had some set backs like Apollo 13, but we have had more men on the moon than any other country (which is still ZERO to America) and there are people who think our country can&#39;t do anything!!!! It is a sad state of affairs!!! And again I am sorry to be critical of the ESA, but you have had more failures than you have had wins and sharing tech is great to cut costs but it seems the metric system fails too often then it succeeds!!

For one, the clocks measure time by measuring those pulses. but as ALL things get shifted by gravity would that not be the time error measured and not be because of some relativistic effect but simply the gravity affecting the MEASURING device?    same thing when you send the info to us, the waves are elongated or shortened when moving away/towards us?<br><br>While I believe there is time dilation, I cant help but think that that effect is merely a by product of tests/experiments that are flawed and not without a fail safe.   all of these require a  measurement that would also be affected by the same effects they are being affected by.  <br><br>So if you measure time by the number of pulses = 1 second. if you red shift you will get those pulses sooner, or later depending on which direction being shifted? meaning the second is not BEING shorter or longer, because of gravity. its the gravity or speed changing nothing more than the measured effect. meaning if you define time by not a count of something but rather a universal period of &quot;time&quot; it cant change. no matter what. sort of like light. but light speed does change in different mediums. so why cant time pass at different speed in different effects(mediums) like gravity.  So I mean I get it, but to me it seems there is no real dilation, its just an artifact of how time is measured.  rather than saying that time is set at 1 second equal to say the amount of time it takes to do some other NON PHYSICAL thing that cant be interacted with, because then it changes the very definition of that measurement.   it would be like the Kilogram thing, as radioactive decay changes the item the KG is based on, but the other items you measured with it have not actually lost mass, but the DEFINITION has changed so if you compare it to that KG it will be a different weight than you had measured before.  but the item you measured never changed. but it will make you think it did.   if that makes sense.   this is the same reason I feel time travel is never possible, there really is nothing to go back to nothing is being stored like a hard drive. its a fluid forever moving in one direction, time dilation MAYBE possible but the times we are detecting with pilots and such are merely an artifact of the measuring devices imperfections and inability to be isolated from the natural world to create a truly arbitrary definition. and its so small that we cant really say it isn&#39;t actually true unless we are able to get someone to live to be 500 years old because they were near a black hole. or something lol. so the effect being so small is un-provable other than using a method of measuring that is not infallible.", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T06:56:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wes Baumguardner", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bull\">#bull</a>$#!+  General relativity cannot describe barycentric gravity.", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T06:55:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niels Logtenberg", "comment_text": "The adpocalypse has aged this man", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T06:54:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harsh Arya", "comment_text": "<b>Hey a question: can an arrow from an archer go faster than light speed , oh maybe not ,but can an arrow in the computer screen can?

He then bent slowly at the waist until his eyes were level with the clockworks. Then, (in what some later claimed was a parody of his already pronounced German accent), Dr. von Braun, with a soft, slow, yet unmistakably MENACING tone, addressed the offending timepiece: &quot;You DO know ...don&#39;t you?

Humanity&#39;s success is best served by disproving prior paradigms, just as you rightly pointed out.  Humanity benefits greatly when our sphere of knowledge expands. Besides, witnessing the ever unfolding wonder of nature is far more exciting when knowable horizons are constantly challenged and constantly expanded. This is what it is to be in relationship with the cosmos. <br><br>Derek, whenever I see a video from you, my mouse can not click fast enough to open the link. Generally, my experience of your channel is to just privately enjoy your videos and excitedly hit &#39;like&#39; at the end! So, usually I don&#39;t engage with comments. Thank you for existing and sharing your mind with us. <br><br>I deeply appreciate your hunger for knowledge and exploration of &quot;outer nature.&quot; The appeal of sharing content about objective reality (that is testable with repeatable results) is that you can joyfully share exciting information with other seekers of knowledge. As your channel continues to grow and expand, I would hope you can evolve your content to equally include important discoveries of what comprises our &quot;inner nature&quot; that we all share in this reality as well. Humans have an instinctive drive to get into connection and relationship with reality. Not just for survival and self preservation, but to have a shared experience of life as well.  Do you agree?<br><br>Does knowing what goes on inside our &#39;mind&#39; and why anything happens inside ourselves have importance when forming relationship and connection to reality? <br><br>More specifically, I&#39;m suggesting that you might want to consider showing the scientific discoveries that help us better know how and why things happen inside ourselves in an objective experience of consciousness. Why does this match up with the essence of your channel? Because to seek &quot;veritas&quot; is to come into relationship and deeper connection with everything. You share neat discoveries with people because you know it helps humanity. Is that correct?  Are people eager to enjoy content about how we have made new discoveries on the matters relating to the &quot;inner conscious experience?&quot;  Would content like that also help humanity?<br><br>I want to stress that the information/discoveries/science available about the human condition is as testable (with repeatable results, with degrees of accuracy) and can be as objective as observing our cosmos. There are subjective conscious experiences, yes. There are differences between one person&#39;s truth, and another person&#39;s truth, yes.  That all being said, there are also observable patterns and valuable science being done revealing how we are the way we are internally.  As much as we&#39;d like to think we are &quot;in the driver&#39;s seat&quot; of our conscious experience, science is revealing that our psychobiology dictates much of what it is to be human more than we give credence to and responsibility for.<br><br>I believe there are overlaps in the many sciences of the cosmos and the many sciences of the human condition. It seems like humanity is entering a phase of knowledge seeking where many previously segregated disciplines are collaborating and overlapping as they share information to form a greater awareness of reality. <br><br>I know you lead a busy and very consumed life as it is with research and being a father. Perhaps the time spent in these things discoverable of the human experience isn&#39;t just value added to humanity, but also value added into your personal life as well? There&#39;s also the question of whether this stuff would mentally stimulate you or not? Give this some thought, and see if what I&#39;m offering is bunk or content worthy.
