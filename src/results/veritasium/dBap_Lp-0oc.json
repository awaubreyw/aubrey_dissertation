Also, interestingly, the Ames room illusion has always been really fickle for me, I only seem to actually get it about a third of the time or so.<br><br>The way someone once explained it to me, the reason these types of illusions ultimately work usually has to do with the fact that we actually only have 2D vision, not 3D vision (if we had the latter, we&#39;d be able to see every surface of every object from all angles simultaneously, which is obviously so different from how our vision <b>actually</b> works that it&#39;s not even really possible to imagine it accurately, but this is how a hypothetical 4D being would presumably see the world), but our brains are really good at combining 2D images from our retinas together to allow us to perceive depth (from a single directional vantage point, at least) and distance in 3D space. Our brains are <b>so</b> good at it, in fact, that they&#39;ll even do it with actual entirely 2D images like paintings, photos, etc. not to mention moving sequences of 2D images like films or animation. However, this means that our brain can also be somewhat easily &quot;tricked&quot; into perceiving illusionary depth in other situations where it seems to directly contradict other visual information we are receiving (because really, all depth perception is kind of an illusion for us in some sense), like when an object appears to move in a way which doesn&#39;t square with the way our brain wants to fit it into 3D space (which is sort of what&#39;s going on here). <br><br>The reason it varies somewhat is because different people&#39;s brains are essentially trained to intuit somewhat differently shaped 3D spaces (like the interior of a rectilinear building versus a rounded building, for instance) depending on what they get used to during the very early formative years of childhood when we&#39;re all first learning to understand this space which we can only <b>directly</b> perceive a little over 2 dimensions of at most. But even with these differences accounted for, <b>no one</b> can actually see in 3D, it&#39;s just not possible with the physics of how light moves through three spatial dimensions, and the physiology of how our eyes are able to obtain sensory information from visible light. Obviously, this last part is pretty much me restating what the video already says, but yeah, our limitations due to 2D vision are usually what&#39;s ultimately to blame for oddities like this.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T22:18:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gordalot", "comment_text": "Keys to focus on a singular point on the rotation.

Thus resulting in an &quot;optical illusion.&quot; I myself can consciously decide as to whether I choose to see the window oscillating or rotating, as I am consciously  aware of what optical qualities, versus what physical attributes, were actually used in composing the image. If I disacknowledge the fact that the window is trapezoidal, and view it as a rectangle, then my brain determines that the narrow end is narrow because of the fact that it is further, so I see it oscillate. Oppositionally, if I choose to acknowledged the window is a trapezoid, then I&#39;m aware that the narrower end looks further away solely because of the fact that it is narrow, not actually further away, so I see it rotate.", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T14:41:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Holmes", "comment_text": "No matter how hard I try to see it rotate, I can&#39;t.

This external world also can interact with us, whether we want it to or not. Believing doesn&#39;t make it so. This is not only true from a physical  perspective, but also true from a moral/ethical perspective which can be similarly distorted by our minds.\u00a0<br><br>These realities also create the even more dangerous situation of being HIGHLY vulnerable to bad actors, people who lie, who are intentionally presenting what they know to be falsehoods, taking advantage of these vulnerabilities.\u00a0<br><br>While Descartes proposed &quot;I think therefore I am,&quot; another experiential near-tautology is that, &quot;I suffer, therefore I am.&quot; Humans and other higher order life have a strong negative response to ambiguity, confusion, uncertainty. When faced with confusion and uncertainty, we suffer. It is this suffering in the face of confusion that bad actors take advantage of (along with other very-human, often related propensities such as a negative response to difference and unfamiliarity). While we may find the illusions presented in the above video discomforting, we find difference and unfamiliarity existentially discomforting.\u00a0<br><br>That is why humans can be manipulated into &quot;going to war&quot; so easily. This is why leaders (often but not always bad actors) paint opponents as different, unfamiliar, alien, etc., which they then easily convince those under them that these differences, this unfamiliarity is effectively primitive, uncivilized, etc. Then they easily convince others that this difference and unfamiliarity means bad, even evil. Thus, they convince others that killing what are fellow humans is a good, beneficent, righteous, even necessary act.\u00a0<br><br>And so, we march off to war.....physical war, psychosocial and/or sociopolitical war.....like the ones going on in America right now where the general public is subjected to &quot;evidence&quot; ie manipulation and systematic propaganda that not only are fellow humans bad, but our own countrymen: other US Citizens......  \ud83d\ude1e<br><br>.", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T12:46:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sivadmg", "comment_text": "lends new creedence to the Democrat/Republican paradox", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T22:37:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paco Goro", "comment_text": "In Spanish, please", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T18:43:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cipher", "comment_text": "BEST CHANNEL OF ALL TIMES", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T18:09:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jordan", "comment_text": "that guy invented free headaches and nausea, a true man of culture", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T12:01:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Shaff", "comment_text": "ok.  jfs EM Drafter 12 yrs.", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T08:56:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blackstar", "comment_text": "the ruler broke the illusion for me...", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T20:49:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Wilson", "comment_text": "\u201cA little more humility; and a little less certainty.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t that be a great Christmas gift for the world?", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T19:10:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "U.S. Militia", "comment_text": "Made my eyes hurt and gave me a slight headache to watch this.

This is why a fisheye lens view looks so strange. Conversely, images shot through a telephoto lens have almost no perspective distortion. They wind up looking flat, and almost like an isometric drawing.<br><br>The Ames window illusion relies on your brain missing the minute size variations of the large and small ends of the trapezoid as they pass closer and farther from you, ignoring them in favor of the perspective cues it is getting from the trapezoid shape and the depth shading in the windows. Because of this, the illusion was much more effective when viewed from a distance in the African experiment. This is also why the large example you built was less effective (in addition to the thickness you mentioned) because it is difficult to back away from it indoors.

This reminds me a bit of the dancing ballerina illusion.  If you&#39;ve never seen that, it&#39;s a VERY similar one, but a silhouette of a ballerina spinning.  The thing is, it can do weird things with your mind, such as even changing direction of rotation.  And, there&#39;s some evidence it does so based on which side of your brain is most active.  Like there was a YouTube video on this where they snuck in a picture of a flock of birds flying to the side of it or other images of order (which activate the left brain) and it would spin one way, while when they put more artistic images into frame (activating the viewer&#39;s right brain), it would spin the other way.  The general conclusion I got at the time was that the way it appeared to spin was entirely dependent on which side of one&#39;s brain was dominant, BUT, that the side of your brain that is dominant (for the purposes of the perception) CAN CHANGE.  So even a left brain dominant, right handed person can be made to be TEMPORARILY right brain dominant based on stimuli AND that this stimuli alters PERCEPTION ITSELF.<br><br>If you&#39;ve never seen that, I can try to find it, though it has been probably a decade since I encountered it...", "comment_date": "2021-09-24T02:19:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fritzafella", "comment_text": "It takes an incredible amount of focus and effort, but I am able to kinda sort asee the illusion for what it is.

So you want a genie to build a palace for you? Great, which of the myriads of designs you want, which of the near infinite wealth of details should be there, where do find building material? Magic! However I tried to come up with a hypothetical theory of magic (demons, energy manipulation, hacking the code of the universe) it either came out nonsensical, or required you to put in the missing complexity by hand anyway. I&#39;m done ranting about magic, but my negative sentiment only makes me like that t-shirt more.

But we assume that everybody is seeing the situation the same way. We all assume that. And then our response is how could they not see it that way? LOL. But like you said, we need to be a little bit more humble and not jump to &quot;oh this is the way it is&quot;, but ask ourselves, is this really the way this is,to be seen? I was guilty of this for many years. I believed that the way I saw things were the only way to see it. Until somebody showed me the &quot;oscillation&quot;. Once you&#39;re exposed to the illusion you can never be fooled again right? So the same goes for conspiracy theorist and the alike. We can show them the illusion, the LIE ,the conspiracy, and then maybe they won&#39;t be fooled anymore? But I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a test that can be given to people so that we can identify these individuals with 100% accuracy. Maybe using AI intelligence? And maybe we can identify different groups throughout the world? Maybe we can identify different groups in the 7 billion people that are on earth? But maybe if we could understand that there are certain of us that see things different from everybody else but we  belong to a group? And maybe once we identify what these illusions are we can bring these illusions down so that we can all be seeing the same reality? Because right now we all believe we are seeing the same reality but through this aims illusion we know that we don&#39;t.

thus is NOT always the same speed.<br><br>IT is ONLY a certain speed - going away from whatever created the light.<br>If a light is shone on a mirror such that it bounces off - at say 90 degrees (from a 45 degree angle mirror) <br>The speed of light aimed towards the mirror - is of course - travelling at the speed of light.<br>The bounced light heading off at 90 degrees - is also heading off, at the speed of light FROM ONLY THE MIRROR, <br>YET if seen from where the light came from originally - it will now only be doing ?<br>Merely about two thirds of the original speed, as it would be travelling across the angle - not the whole distance - if &quot;seen&quot; to be travelling - from it&#39;s original source.<br><br>Also - if one is TRAVELLING - at high speed (a lot faster than a cop will allow) - such as in a fighter jet - that is approaching the speed of sound..?<br><br>ANY LIGHT- shone at the jet - from behind it - appears to be coming at the jet - at a speed about the same SLOWER SPEED <br>As the speed of sound difference to the speed of light. ie: a lot slower and will take a long time to &quot;light up&quot; the jet - which by then will be a long way away.<br>As - the light reflected off the jet - will also take longer to travel back the greater distance - to it&#39;s source - for anyone holding the torch - to &quot;see&quot; the jet in the light beam !!!<br><br>In other words - the light trying to catch the jet - will take a LONG TIME.<br>Whereas if a light is SHONE - to the front of a jet - going at or near the speed of sound.<br>Whatever shone that light will see the reflected light a LOT QUICKER than anyone shining a light from behind.<br>Yet <br>The ground speed of that beam of light - will in fact be travelling at the speed of sound FASTER than a light being shone from behind the jet - from a ground source.<br>ie:<br>ADD the speed of the jet (itself travelling at or near to - the speed of sound) onto the jet&#39;s speed of light &quot;light beam&quot; which will be emitted to the front of the jet - at the speed of light away from the jet<br>And you will have a beam of light (in respect to the ground) travelling almost twice the speed of light.<br><br><br>But - if a light is shone out the rear of that same jet - towards whatever is being shone at it, the two lights will &quot;cross&quot; about where the jet left the airport - not at either the jet&#39;s position  nor the ground source position of the other light.<br><br>Thus each is travelling at twice it&#39;s own speed - (in respect to each light beam) if seen from the front tip - of either light.<br><br>Otherwise - what point would there be - to having headlights on a car - if the car (say travelling at the speed of light) - couldn&#39;t get the light to come out of the headlamp unit - to light up the road - half a mile ahead of the speeding vehicle.?", "comment_date": "2021-08-20T16:01:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "QUIX4U", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=5m02s\">5:02</a> - to - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=5m09s\">5:09</a><br>I spotted that by actually concentrating extremely hard - on JUST the one bottom corner of the orange colour - inside the edge piece<br>AND by keeping the BEND (curvature) of the length of that piece of card - in one&#39;s mind<br>I can &quot;just&quot;

But keep in mind: It&#39;s perfect because nobody will ever be capable to find evidence for this fantasy construct to be right. The &quot;string theory&quot; is a money procurement construct, an employment project for physicists, that neither nor in the future, any tangible result will deliver, since humans will never be able to think in the postulated higher dimensions.

But I could get it to work at least 50% of the time at the beginning but the more I do it the easier it gets.", "comment_date": "2021-07-10T21:53:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bella Tan", "comment_text": "The teeny-tiny apple postnatally share because tablecloth simultaneously post plus a tame seashore. outrageous, eminent raven", "comment_date": "2021-07-10T21:08:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Animation", "comment_text": "by the time it reached the 6 minute(the video)..

The people with a large room would no longer need to work to &quot;showcase&quot; the room for each videoconference, and those with a very small room could similarly convey a sense of spaciousness. I hope you understand where I&#39;m going with this. The obvious answer is to get a backdrop. However, If I believe if a typical backdrop were installed in either case, it would be noticably flat, or obviously a backdrop. Is it possible to use an Ames-style, image or imprint on a flat backdrop that would convey a sense of spaciousness behind the video user without it being apparent? My hopes are this <b>should</b> give a video frame a sense of depth and perhaps provide a &quot;visually interesting&quot;, but not distracting, background that will convey a pleasant background.

Everything is bent due to this effect.  It is also why the moon never moves across the field of view when driving on a straight length of highway, whereas mountains in the distance do very slightly, and the foreground even faster.  We are just traversing the same number of miles on the surface of the moon as we are on its planet, but the moon is so large, we cannot even mark the length of our travel (65 miles) in an hour, because it is zoomed down so small.  <br><br>The interesting parallel here, is the concept of projection.  Whereby you get a trapezoid if you have a square framed image projected on a planar surface that is not normal (perpendicular) to the optical axis of the projection (hence trapezoidal adjustment on projectors).  Moreover, projection of matrices in mathematics apply here,.  Just as your Ames room projects points along the lines of perspective onto a planar surface that is not normal to the z axis of the room, you can see that a cube casts a shadow of several different polygons depending upon the 3D position in space of the cube with respect to the parallel lines of the light from the sun (and again, the sun being nearly a million miles in diameter, is casting its light onto the relatively tiny Earth (8k miles in diameter) such that their radial separation (due to a point source of that diameter) is very small, thus practically parallel light rather than light from a light bulb, which is in contrast, a point source of light, thus with large radii meaning a cone of light emanating from it).<br><br>So goes the concept of unfolding a 3D object into 2D, like the six squares forming a cross, which can be folded into a 3rd dimension and becoming a cube.  Add a dimension to the problem, and 6 cubes become a 3D unfolded version of a 4D object.  If you could fold the unfolded 3D tesseract into the 4th dimension, you would have 6 cubes sharing the same 3D space, or, superpositioning through th 4th dimension,  If you put a dot on one of the unfolded cube walls, then fold it into the 4th dimension, that dot would exist in one wall of all 6 cubes.  That dot would have 6 existences, or instances, yet still be the original singular dot, existing in 6 different places, each simply a different perspective of the same 4D space, but we can only perceive them as being stacked ontop of each other, because we cannot fathom a 4th physical dimension.  <br><br>The Ames window is doing the same thing with a 2D projection of a 3D object, and when you put a 3D object onto that 2D rotating object, then the 3D object offers a 3rd extra dimension for your brain to process, which is why it is clearly rotating around the 2D trapezoidal abnormal perspective 2D object.<br><br>Effectively, without shading, you lose the 3rd dimension when a 2D drawing of a 3D object is viewed; that is the whole point -- projection loses dimensional information.  Shading, though still 2D, can provide the 3rd dimension (Z axis) indirectly, by inserting a new perspective -- a light source, and it works because that light source, exists in a 3rd dimension, and makes the entire picture as projection of that perspective, through the 2D projection of that light source, only by putting dark shadows where the 3rd dimension would cast them,  It is indirectly creating a 3rd dimension.  Without this, a staircase can be inverted in your mind.<br><br>So perhaps in the end, we see that perception of reality can be easily clarified if we understand perspectives, and, if only we could fathom the 4th, 5th and other dimensions -- if a 2D object can fool us into believing there is or isn;t a 3rd dimension, then quantum mechanics, double slit experiment, quantum erasure experiment, etc., might all have an obvious answer if the correct dimensional information were filled-in to our perspective.

Many factors play a near simultaneous role in predator prey interactions, but there seems to be a priority of importance. Animals seem to be first oriented to any movement which represents a change in the instantaneous static picture they have of their surroundings.  Then they are using static lighting and shapes to discern predators (or prey) to tell them what is present (hence the value of camouflage).

The faces are actually a extremely easy case to determine depth, inpression has a receeding jawline due to the blocked off decline of the chin, so it easy easy to determine depth based on the position of the chin, aswell as the inverted shadows caused by light. Beating this illusion is no different, Looking through the illusion and focusing on what information can continue to be seen within/around it, how much of the background perception is blocked, abnormal interactions with light, and most importantly shifting &quot;depth&quot; of the object itself particularly when it reached a parallel position to the viewer losing all depth. As for the skull painting. I simply see a skewed but clearly skewed skull at all angles from the start, but I suppose 2 conflicting inputs from your eyes may result in a distorted blur to some... Akin to the 3d image&#39;s that require 2 crossing points of view aimed behind the image to see , which I simply can not at all.<br><br> When your brain has been trained to utilize all this consistently reliable information RATHER than rely heavily on the use of the 2 (trained but still ultimately random) crossing points of view to gain a false estimated perception of depth which is technically an illusion itself, you can easily see through these illusions attempting to exploit said interaction. This is actually why humans have a superior depth perception with one eye closed, however in general practices the offset of pov will leave most people disoriented in normal activity. But when orienting a object which you can center at the eye, that is no longer a issue.

It seem to be such an anathema, that the existence of waves does seems to have any not need to even enter such explanations.<br>The reason behind this attitude, of deep acceptance of waves, where there are none, is the very long and deeply ingrained view of waves that has come to be held by those studying quantum mechanics. To even propose this concept, of waves not even existing anywhere, is not only extremely foreign to QM physicist, but it paints a very threatening picture of what it would mean, if that were true. So much so that, such a thought never, ever ,enters into considerations towards explaining the outcome of any experiment or how some quantum scale phenomenon works.

I&#39;m guessing that standing closer while looking through a wide angle lens, it&#39;d be easier to tell the difference in height of each end when that end is closer to you as compared to when it is farther away, potentially making it easier to sort out -  but I&#39;d love to be proven wrong about that.  This would track with the results of the study done in South Africa that you mentioned in the video - when they stood farther away, it became more difficult to recognize the rotation.  The longer the focal length of the lens you look through, the more the difference in size between foreground and background becomes diminished, right..?  So I&#39;d think that the intensity of this illusion would be most pronounced when looking through a relatively long focal length lens.

So who knows if the focal length could even make enough difference to overcome the illusion?  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af<br>Anyway, this is one of the best visual tricks I&#39;ve ever seen.

If that&#39;s not what you&#39;re saying, that is what I am saying. <br><br>God is an objective reference point for the binding of humanity. Without a removed, objective, entirely unbiased, completely uninvolved party, with whom people can refer all thought, ideas, and perspectives, people create destructive levels of divergent thoughts and ideas. Hate becomes &#39;ok&#39;. Love becomes meaningless. Hurting others with violence becomes acceptable, etcetera, etcetera. Only through an objective, static, unchanging lens can humanity view itself and the world around us in a sane, rational, and beneficial way. Remove that lens and humanity can justify unimaginable atrocities in the name of &quot;perspective&quot;. Static, unchanging morality is therefore inherently essential to the healthy functioning of humanity because God doesn&#39;t care about you as far as you on an individual level are concerned. God cares about you functioning well within the reality He constructed. Hence God&#39;s commandments not to lie, kill, steal, covet what others have, and above all things, to respect, revere, and love, above all things, God. Why? God is the only being who can see reality as it is and as it should be and fallen humanity cannot. Humanity is a creation of God and is the only creation of God which can openly defy reality because of our freedom to chose. We are sentient beings, whereas no other being on earth is. Every other life form on earth cooperates with its innate nature. Only humans want to chop up their bodies because they loath and defy their innate nature. We are above nature and can add to it or take from it. My question is, why isn&#39;t this obvious and essential fact appreciated by the scientific community? The truth of this fact is being played out in real, observable, time in front of your very faces. Hate God all you want. Reject the existence of God all you want. Doing so will always and forever, bring the world right back here, division, societal collapse, fighting, war, death, ignorance, and then finally, back to God. Humanity will either keep its respect for God or humanity will devolve into rabid monsters, lower even than animals. And it must do so, freely. Forced morality is not the same as individually agreed to morality. In short, you have to choose to live by God&#39;s ways. Rome, England, France, and many others have tried to force morality upon others and that didn&#39;t work out for anyone who has ever tried. People have to want to better their own lives by living in conformity, to the extent that they are able, with reality. Will humanity succeed? No. That&#39;s why God&#39;s son taught us all of the importance of both change (repentance) and forgiveness (the passing over of divergent thoughts, ideas, and behavior so that humanity doesn&#39;t freak out when things don&#39;t go perfectly because, we should all know by now that, even the best of humanity is deeply flawed and imperfect. <br><br>The one thing with which I absolutely agree is that humility is the key.

The algorithm now has it easy because it has a reference, the cube, it increases the number of restrictions but the cube has little weight and the perspective predominates, but if you pay close attention you will see that the cube is closer to your face, but being the small side, that information predominates, the algorithm discards it, the cube appears in the background. If you number the faces you will see what happens. Seeing and looking occur on two different planes in the algorithm. The sense sees, I would say that it is what processes, if something like that can be said, the occipital lobe. The psychological self looks, it is the one that interprets what is seen, here there is much more treatment than what is seen with other areas of memory and with emotion<br>This textual monstrosity, a brutal simplification, is explanation mixed with contemplative description. By doing experiments and mixing people who have different vision algorithms, products of behavior, environment, culture, coordinated by the intentionality of consciousness, the results cannot be understood.<br>All that make experiments with the combination of transducers (senses), algorithms for the production of functional analogs to the needs of the body, and an active memory, are lost because they do not have a contemplative model and due to the lack of correct methodology. It is absurd to use explanation for the black box method when I have direct access to the phenomenon and I can use a phenomenological method of description if I have the logical categories properly internalized and the understanding of how to use the intellect, so that the synthesis process, not voluntary as digestion, called understanding happen correctly<br> That of the thirty-odd elements for the construction of spatiality came from a study made during the Second World War commissioned by the US army to build sights for bombers.

This was even more so, but that&#39;s not part of the story, I&#39;m pretty sure. <br>I was out in my backyard, putting out food and water for my cats during the middle of the afternoon.

But I bent over to put water in a bowl, and out of the corner of my eye, for just a second, my brain glimpsed something!!<br>The high clouds, for those of you who know, can create a phenom known as sundogs, bright spots of reflection determined by the angle of the sun to the observer, etc. etc. <br>Well I was just in the right place at the right time. It&#39;s not like I&#39;d never seen sun dogs! They are a wonderful atmospheric phenomenon. But at that instant, my brain was somewhere else, and I, being a lifelong astronomy and sci-fi reader got lost in my head a little bit. My brain knew where the sun was, it was beating down overhead, but the sundog didn&#39;t quite register as a sundog instantly because I was distracted. The first thing that came up in my list of brain definition of a second bright light in the sky like that was &quot;second sun!!&quot; So for just an instant I was living on a binary sun planet!! HAHAHA <br>It was wild there in my world, but it didn&#39;t last long.

Even then, I figured it was in principle like an Ames Room, but they incorporated gravity into the illusion. As you went from room to room, the gravity shifted increasingly toward the opposite side of the room. Tourists walked in at the northeast corner of the building (through the north wall) walked along a path defined by a rail to the  southeast corner, where they made a 90 degree turn. The rest of the tour, they were on the south side of the building walking west. The doors they walked through were right next to that southern wall. In each room, the illusion was that gravity was pulling you more and more northward rather than downward--but also that the rooms were each cubes (or at least had 90 degree angles at every edge). The tour guides did things like make water appear to run uphill in one room and having a tourist defy gravity by sitting in an ordinary chair which had its back legs placed on a 2x4 nailed to the north wall, while the front legs hung out in midair (I was the volunteer on our trip, and I even stumbled against the gravity on my trip back to the south wall).<br>Obviously, the trick was that each room in the building was progressively more and more inclined so that the north was lower than the south end. I understood that even at age 7. But what flummoxed me was <i>how they concealed it.</i> It wasn&#39;t difficult to SEE from one room into the next, to compare the floor of the last room to that of the next. And I couldn&#39;t see any change in pitch. Nor could I see anything to indicate that the floor in any room was curved or warped.

If I say there are no apples in the dish, and state a fact by doing so, you may easily assume the dish is empty, but I didn&#39;t say that there were in stead of apples bananas in that dish. And so perhaps you can now also succesfully deduce why I never lost a game of darts against Raymond van Barneveld, Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor...

I inherited a book with most of his work when my grandfather passed away, and although the book is really in an awful state (I know a place where I can give that book some &quot;treatment&quot; but it has to wait until the COVID19 misery is over), the content in it is still looking good, and really no matter how many times I keep browsing through that book the more I am amazed by the way he could create things that are physically impossible, but which work in a drawing (next to the other kind of graphic effects he managed to work with making things perfectly go over in each other). It appears Escher himself always refused to acknowledge there was any science or mathematics in his work.... Did you ever do a video on how Escher&#39;s &quot;fake reality&quot; pictures manage to work out giving us a thing we know is physically impossible, and yet they work, and sometimes we know the picture cannot be, but cannot explain why it cannot be...

I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get. But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, \u2018God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&quot; <br><br>The lesson here the tax collector witnessed himself what he became through the sins he committed and humbled himself and asked the lord to forgive him for all sins he has committed against God. Where as the Pharisee thanked God for not being like the others, the lesson here is that the Pharisee was blinded by his own sins, he was not better or different from the tax collector and asked God to be blessed, rather than acknowledging his own sins and repenting of them he rather said that he was thankful he was not like the others, but no matter how many good things we do or say we have all sinned and sin until you humble yourself and ask God to forgive through Jesus Christ. <br><br>So look at yourself today and look at the poor and the rich and the people from who are in jail and the people who serve the army to the people work to help in hospitals or nursing homes, no one is different from the other, sin is punished by how severe it is but it doesn&#39;t matter who you are, we are all sinners and deserve to go to hell to be punished for them. <br><br>But here is the best news you will hear today, Jesus who came down to earth lived a sinless life to do the work of the will of his father, through Jesus Christ he has taught us so much and he died to pay for our sins. His blood set us free. If you want to know what love feels like, if you want to know what joy feels like say this prayer and accept Jesus into your life. It is by far I will say the best choice I have made in the 22 years of my life. <br><br>&quot;Father forgive me for I am a sinner, I have sinned and in need of a saviour, please forgive me(repent of all known and unknown sins). I believe that Jesus Christ is the only begotten son of God, I believe he died in the cross for me for my sins, I believe that he rose on the third day, please come into my heart and give me a new one, I accept you as my personal lord and saviour and I put my whole faith and trust and mind, soul heart and spirit in you.&quot; Amen <br><br>Please he loves you and he wants you.<br><br>Praise our lord and saviour, lord of lords and king of kings", "comment_date": "2021-01-13T23:56:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiko", "comment_text": "hahahahahaha<br><br><br><br><br>iron y", "comment_date": "2021-01-13T23:49:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "renamix", "comment_text": "Here cause of the iDubbz shout out, it was well worth the watch.

A darkened room and a lighted cigarette with a burning coal held close to the base of the vase. The normally red coal will appear a vivid bright glowing green. Not sort of green but vividly green. Clearly why the optical society of America defines light as radiant energy visual evaluated. Without an eye there is no color or light.

Rainbow trout are really hard to spot, even though they have a very defined pink band, but if you do these things they will stand out at you, almost as much as a neon pink fish would.  <br><br>with your windows you can take advantage of the fact that it is a 3d object, one side will always lead the other, it doesn&#39;t matter how flat you get it, this will always remain true, to me it feels innate to know something is off with the picture, and that cues me to look at the world not as i think it to be but as it is, to actually handle the interpreting and labeling of everything in the scene rather than pass it on to what ever part of the brain will do its best attempt. There is likely a reason people dont tend to do this often and that is because it is tiring, instead of dismissing information that you probably dont need you are basically saying every bit of info is important there is always that one line in some shows or stories of &quot;if the human brain didnt filter things out it would short circuit&quot; but that is a misconception. it is merely tiring, im no expert on history, but im pretty certain when man was hunter gatherer this is how they stayed alive, it is how people were able to spot predators as well as pray, to hunt, and track.

Everything else not so much due to either seeing the sides of the paper being a bit separated or lighting.<br><br>That being said, you talked about the illusion being due to one side being larger than the other but for me its the painted shadow. When the large end passes by, it makes sense but once it swings away the shadow would normally be hidden if its a 3d object but because it doesn&#39;t I see the oscillating pattern. <br>Lighting and the sides of the paper breaks this illusion due to giving us more things for our eyes to track allowing us to see what&#39;s really happening. I believe that Adelbert Ames is correct about people being use to rectangles see the illusion stronger than people who don&#39;t but I personally believe its the painted shadows that really sell the illusion. Everyone since the beginning of time uses light to see and with light we see shadows. Shadows are one of the main ways we determine depth so removing it or altering it can mess with our sense of depth drastically for everyone. The lack of detail helps prevent our eyes from picking up any other detail so that we can only determine what&#39;s going on based off our knowledge of what should happen.<br>There is one thing I&#39;m interested to know though, what if there was a dot on one side?

To be unable force your mind to perceive such a simple optical illusion correctly is a strong case against our ability to intuitively find the optimal decisions. The proposal for letting go of the certainty - realizing and accepting that one&#39;s intuition might sometimes be misleading - would do good for most of us (yours truly included of course). I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a name for the phenomenon but I&#39;ve been noticing that the less people know about something the more certain and absolute they are about their opinions on it (and vice versa). Take climate change, nuclear energy and nowadays virology for example - these are some of the hardest concepts to grasp in our modern world, yet almost anyone seems to not only have an opinions but very strong one about each. This of course is not anything spectacular - as you gather knowledge of pretty much anything, you also become aware of the complexity it concerns and are forced to abandon any simple black and white perspectives regarding it. Unfortunately, people who don&#39;t have this experience about anything might be hard convince to see how it works and this could be a part of the problem why populism is such an effective strategy. In my opinion this is a serious matter in today&#39;s world where any message can be relayed to a huge audience via the internet and developing strategies to fight it should be in the top priority list of mankind.

Consider the fact that, what we think we see in front of us is a flat image, so you would think our field of vision can be represented by a rectangular cube in front of us. But really, our field of vision is 2 cones intersecting. As such, in order for our brains to process the image as something we can deal with, we &quot;squeeze&quot; (not really, but the best way I can explain it) the conic images into a rectangular format, the wider side of the cone has to &quot;squeeze&quot; into smaller space of the rectangle. And as such, has to be &quot;squeezed smaller&quot; in our vision. And this &quot;squeezing&quot;, gives up vanishing points with the horizon line and gravity(giving us up and down via seeing animals and trees, etc. ), naturally gives us rectangular angles and trapezoidal angles. (and perspective). Please pardon the crude explanation. I&#39;m an artist, not a neurologist. This is something that most artists learn (or should have learned). <br><br>I do have to note that,  yes, the lighting has to be &quot;the same&quot; (basically, enough light to bleach out the details that would signify one side from the other) on both sides of the window. But also if the rotational axis had been closer to the smaller end (or maybe even directly in the middle) of the window, that probably break the illusion.

I used to be a financial analyst at a hospital. My duties required me to generate one large report which contained multiple subsets of the same data creating a report that contained Accounts Receivable financial billing, reimbursement and contractual write offs or adjustments of medical bills that were further broken down by individual specialist and primary care doctors. The data was repotted by financial groups Medicare, Medicaid, Managed Healthcare Insurance, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and others. The report showed also showed productivity reports created by what CPT was reported on the submitted bill to the insurance carrier(s). Because it CPT is grouped into a certain subset. For example a 99211 is an for an office or outpatient evaluation and management code for  an established patient . Office/outpatient evaluation and management visits are coded in a group from 99211 through 99215. The difference between each number is the amount of time spent with the patient and number of systems examined. Someone going in to have blood pressure checked might be scored as 99211- while if that same patient had instead had bp, an echocardiogram, and discussion of 3 or more illnesses like diabetes, copd, and also has pneumonia might be coded as a 99215. There are several other groups of evaluation and management groups besides this example. If a doctor is seeing patients on a regular schedule, this information can be plotted out in a graph. If the doctor is properly coding his encounters with his patients properly the productivity report should generate a bell curve graph.<br><br>This is an enormous report created for 35 different offices and over 300 physicians, physician assistants and nurses. These reports need to generated every month and when providers generate submit this information, they expect all information to be generated fast, friendly to read and above all information correct . I created a program that would run algorithms to cross check the finished reports. The source data when added to previous month and and fiscal year to date information.  If a cross check failed there was conditional rules that if cross checks failed their information on the page turned. The report red. If all checks balanced correctly, the report would not have <a href=\"http://any.red/\">any.red</a> conditionals and just app as a normal report.   Then I got a co-worker to help me with the checks. Let me give you further information. I am dyslexic and prior to working with the person assigned to my group. She looked a my proofing algorithms and said they made no sense to her. She then showed me her algorithms she used to proof the same reports. Just a further bit of information- I am dyslexic and my proofs kept my reports error for the last 10 years. But when my coworker reviewed that data and proof by a method that was completely opposite of what I came.up with. I investigated her proof. Hers worked the same way as mine but used a different perspective. I have the ability to see the data in my head and can visualize the hierarchy and relationships to all the reports in a 3 dimensional relationship. I could see it clearly and could visualize all connections. My partner lacked that ability and her brain saw other patterns my mind missed and her method created a double check on that same data. We built both types of verification checks into the whole system of reports. This only strengthened our abilities to generate a flawless report accurate to the penny and proceedure.  We both could now see that we saw the data in exact opposite views and we turned that process to our advantage. We each saw the same information but in opposite ways, we them turned it into our greatest strength.", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T05:45:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "klenzgaming", "comment_text": "i forced myself to perceive it as it really is, rotating.. and now i find it hard to see it oscillating", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T05:42:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melvin Sim", "comment_text": "I know how to do it.

The closer, the bigger. <br><br>When viewing something at a great distance, using camera at a great distance or using a special lense and software the amount of real perspective can be reduced so things don&#39;t appear to get smaller the farther away they are.<br><br>When you physically draw something or make an object you can add virtual perspective to create the appearance of distance. Items or portions of objects you want to appear father away would be deliberated drawn/made smaller then items or portions of objects you want to appear closer.<br><br>What is being done here is the object has been created with a large amount of virtual perspective and if you look closely you can see the real world perspective has been deliberately minimized. Look at the size of the ruler as it spins. The closer end should become larger than the farther end but it doesn&#39;t so the real perspective is minimal.<br><br>Another thing to keep in mind is in the real world we also have the ability to estimate distance by a combination of parallax and focus as well. (On a 2D screen we only have perspective).<br><br>Parallax is caused by viewing the same real world scene from two separate but close locations (two eyes) at the same time. Our brains considers the fact that closer objects will move slightly with respect to farther objects and use this to help estimate distance. Focus is the fact that your eyes (or a camera) will need to use a different focal length to get a clear image for different distances and again your brain uses this to help estimate distance.<br><br>With only perspective available when viewing a 2d screen (computer screen, tv or phone) and having the real perspective minimized using one of the methods (such as viewing from a distance), if the image contains large amounts of virtual perspective it is expected that our brains conclude the window is rotating back and forth instead of around continuously.<br><br>One thing worth thinking about if you&#39;ve got this far is 3D TVs and 3D movies and why they don&#39;t feel realistic (and sometimes result in headaches or feeling ill). 3D TV/movies are generated using both virtual perspective (smaller object size when farther away) and parallax (different views for each eye). The parallax is created by using 2 lenses separated by a similar distance to eye separation and then using some method to replay those separated lense captures back to your individual eyes (polarization, color, frame blocking, etc). 3D TVs/movies are not able to simulate true distance so your eyes only need to focus on the single distance of the screen. The problem is that your brain expects you to need a different focus for distant vs close objects when viewing in 3d. To many people this is a major issue and kills the enjoyment added by current 3D tech. There are some more advanced 3D technologies that combine the combination of projection, parallax, and focus but unfortunately they are both extremely expensive and currently suffer from poor image quality.<br><br>For now our TVs, computers and phones will have to make do with just using perspective to indicate distance, which means if the perspective is deliberately modified we will be unable to properly judge distance...", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T04:25:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Purple Shaft", "comment_text": "This is so Lovecraftian", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T04:23:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "leafar", "comment_text": "I could see it turn normally when you put yourself and the rule though it, but when you put the rubix cube i couldn&#39;t", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T04:20:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\ud835\udde3ure\ud83c\udff4", "comment_text": "interesting!!", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T04:19:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NashFPV", "comment_text": "the illusion broke for me with the cube had to really pay attention to shadows though", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T04:18:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hamish Craze", "comment_text": "So strange.

God wants to give you Salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Jesus has done for us.<br><br>(KJV)1 Corinthians 15:1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the Gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.\u00a0 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br>(KJV)Ephesians 2:8-9 For by Grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the Gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.<br><br>Gospel of Salvation by Faith Alone<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/H124iZiyGUs\">https://youtu.be/H124iZiyGUs</a><br><br>Saved by Grace thru Faith 1 minute vid<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/1wMldFej-nQ\">https://youtu.be/1wMldFej-nQ</a><br><br>End Time&#39;s Checklist<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI\">https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI</a><br><br>Satan&#39;s Technology (Mark of the Beast)<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4IyPCGKFa0k\">https://youtu.be/4IyPCGKFa0k</a><br><br>Escape Satan&#39;s Rule and God&#39;s Wrath<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/URzo9_eOa00\">https://youtu.be/URzo9_eOa00</a>", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:38:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan M", "comment_text": "Now I have to redesign my house to have no right angles", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:38:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Officer_Baitlyn", "comment_text": "if i concentrate on the upper paper edge i can tell its spinning, but when i look at the full picture i really cant", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:38:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryce Ring", "comment_text": "Nothing Normal about that Illusion", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:37:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vampH7per", "comment_text": "I would say that seeing this on a 2D screen does not fit the definition of an illusion, atleast not if Googles definition is followed).<br>There is no difference between what you would see if it was oscillating as opposed to it rotating, so technically there is no right or wrong answer because it would look identical either way.", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:37:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leon", "comment_text": "Does anyone know the saving screen from Lego City undercover ?", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:37:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leeann G", "comment_text": "ow ow ow ow ow", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:35:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "icouldjustscream", "comment_text": "I can see both.

After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lordjesusiscoming\">#LordJesusiscoming</a>", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:30:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BXu", "comment_text": "I think the bigger ones have too much information therefore it\u2019s easily different from a 2D perfect lighting world", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:29:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thanks for all that", "comment_text": "Gets the noggin joggin", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:26:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just Ocho", "comment_text": "You broke my brain", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:26:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "keyserxx", "comment_text": "That&#39;s the coolest sex swing I&#39;ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:25:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shazil Mohammed KP", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a> nope. the cube seemed to stop and move back for me\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:23:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chaos ink", "comment_text": "i can see both<br>probleme is that when i start to see the rotation, i can&#39;t manage to see osilating :(", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:23:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ravin G", "comment_text": "Man conducted a fantastical science experiment to tell y&#39;all to cool it in the comments section. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:21:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BXu", "comment_text": "Or if you just let go and just stare at it it looks like a four dimensional object", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "overhaul", "comment_text": "So Nord VPN creates an illusion for your IP address.", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:15:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BXu", "comment_text": "What you need to do is to look at the shadows of the object", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T12:14:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Nagel", "comment_text": "The routers @ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=11m15s\">11:15</a> make the opening notes to Close Encounter of the Third Kind!

Even his use of language &quot;from a certain privileged perspective&quot; hints at his knowing exactly the situation taking place. I don&#39; t take him for a fool, and he is in the business of education so I&#39;m going to assume he&#39;s caught up with the current state of affairs plaguing universities and educational institutions across the west, and the timing and message of this video isn&#39;t just an exact coincidence. <br><br>Arguments like 2+2=5 are trying to be legitimized, or ethnic math is being pushed, or the debate around gender being social/biological and various epistemologies-(the way which we come to know things-) are being seen as just as legitimate and useful as others just to spite and devalue (particularly) white western male accomplishments. And this kind of video is the attack vector that they (mainly sjws) use to muddy the waters. He advocates we approach our conclusions with humility and question everything but what he&#39;s not acknowledging is the cynicism that is necessary to do that towards EVERYTHING. This is fundamental to critical theory and postmodern thought that seeks to deconstruct and delegitimize all forms of knowing any truth, which leaves the gate open for ideologues with agendas to abuse and fill in the gaps.  It&#39;s how we&#39;ve gotten to a place like this where basically &quot;my gender is whatever I say it is&quot; or &quot;to me, America started in 1619&quot; or &quot;my truth is just as valid as yours&quot; even though one method of knowing facts gets you to the moon and cures disease or gives you a deeper understanding of reality and the others are just a flawed episteme that tries to legitimize itself to suit an agenda.<br><br>The disingenuous undertone to this whole video, the timing and the message it tries to convince the viewers of reeks of sjw propaganda disguised as an educational video. This isn&#39;t the first time Vertasium has exploited the current societal discussion to further a particular side of the argument either.  <br><br>Then there&#39;s the flaws with the message in the video itself. He uses an example of a known phenomenon to try to make the case that nothing is certain. Yet we are pretty certain of the phenomenon taking place. We recognize the flaws within our brain and compensate for that in other ways (by looking at the object from different perspectives) to obtain the truth behind what is really happening. Our brains are not carefully fixed cameras viewing an object at one angle all the time, thus there&#39;s a false equivalence happening here. Our brains can view things from different reference frames which is how we know the object is spinning, even though we also know that from certain angles it looks differently than others. So the idea that just because certain reference frames can be exploited in special, specific conditions means that all reference frames are untrustworthy is a false assumption. Typical sjw propaganda technique which tries to delegitimize everything, muddy the waters and then have you follow them through it so that now they control the narrative. This video is the &quot;muddy the waters&quot; type of video which sets you up to be led through by an ideologue later if you aren&#39;t use to seeing this kind of argument and recognizing the signs.", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T03:52:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Taylor", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=16m50s\">16:50</a> Clearly, you are trying to be Iron Man.", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T03:51:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikoli WhatzItToYa", "comment_text": "You are gonna lose your s*** when you find out about the game superliminal", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T03:50:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BearPaw", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> you already got me !", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T03:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "heyimgoingtoplaysomegames", "comment_text": "I was finally able to \u201csee\u201d how it truly is, but it\u2019s extremely difficult, it\u2019s almost like meditating, and I have to force my brain not to do what it wants! \ud83d\ude06", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T03:48:05Z", "likes_count": 21}, {"comment_by": "Eric Taylor", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=13m55s\">13:55</a> Actually that isn&#39;t true.

Here are two thought-experiments:<br><br>1.) Take 3 star ships (A,B and C), moving parallel to each other in free space in a way, that there are in the same frame of inertia. The distance AB shall be equal to the distance BC and half of the distance AC (B is located in the middle of AC). Each of them has a very precise clock aboard. To synchronize the clocks, B sends a signal to A and C. First let&#39;s assume a isotropic speed of light c:<br>The Signal needs 1 sec to reach the other two space ship. If the clock B showed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> when the signal was send, the clocks A and C are showing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> when the signal arrives. For an observer in A, the clocks A and B are perfectly synchronized: if the observer in A looks to the clock B, it shows the same time as the clock A. However, the clock C is for the obsever in A about 2 seconds delayed: The signal for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> C time arrives <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m02s\">00:00:02</a> A time. An observer in C would see the very same events as the obsever in A, because of the symmetry of the problem. The observer in B sees both clocks A and C delayed as the time the signal needs to travel from B to A and back (or from B to C and back) is again 2 seconds. Now the ships A and C perform a rotational symmetric maneuver and switch places. The time dilatation dt is, as long the speed of the ships during the maneuver v &lt;&lt; c, negliable to the travel-time of the signals dt&lt;&lt;t(xy) with t(xy) ={ t(AB)==t(BA), t(AC)==t(CA), t(BC)==t(CB) }. Even more imporant: the observations of an observer in A are still identical to the observations to an observer in C and the time by wich the clocks A and C are delayed to an observer in B is identical, too. Thus for an observer in A, the clock B is still synchronized (if you neglect the small difference dt) and the clock C is still delayed by 2 seconds (analogue for C) and for the observer in B, still both clocks A and C are delayed by 2 seconds.<br>Now repeat the same experiment with anisotropic speed of light. In the direction AB, AC and BC the speed of light shall be infinity, in the opposite direction c/2. One of the major aspects of SRT is the lorentz-invariance of space time. Despite having an anisotropic c, the formulas for coordinate system transformation are still the same! So B sends a signal at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> B time. It arrives instantaneously in C (now synched to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> C time) and arrives 2 seconds later in A (now showing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> A time). For the observer in A, the clocks A and B are perfectly synchronized: the signal for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> send in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> B time arrives in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> A time. The clock C however is for an observer in A about 2 seconds delayed: the signal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m00s\">00:00:00</a> C time arrives A at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBap_Lp-0oc&amp;t=00h00m02s\">00:00:02</a> A time. For the observer in C, the clock B is perfectly synchronized, where as the clock A is about 2 seconds delayed. For the observer in B, both clocks A and C are 2 seconds delayed. Until now, everything seems to be identical to the case of the isotropic speed of light. But now A and C perform again the maneuver. As the formulas of the SRT are still valid, the time dilation for two objects moving at a relative speed of v&lt;&lt; c is still negliable! The Lorentz-Factor \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c(\u03d1))\u00b2) is still close to one (or beeing exactly 1 for c = infinity), despite having only a speed of light c/2 in one direction \u03d1. But what does the different observers measure?! The observer in C (now at the former position of A) would see, that the clock B is now 2 seconds delayed and the clock A even 6 seconds!! For the observer B, the clock C is now synchronized, whereas clock C is now 4 seconds delayed. For the observer in A, now both clocks B and C are 2 seconds ahead! Not only are the observers in A and C measuring different things, all observers are measuring notably different time differences between the clocks compared to the situation before the maneuver.<br><br>Conclusion: A spacetime with an anisotropic speed of light would be NOT rotational invariant!!<br><br>There is also a more practical and realizable way to proof the isotropy of the speed of light:<br>2.) Take a monochromatic source of light, e.g. a laser. An electron relaxing from an excited state to an lower state emitts a photon with the Energy E=h\u03bd equal to the energy-difference of these two states. Frequency and wavelength of an electromagnetic wave (as well as of any other wave) are connected by the simple equation c = \u03bb\u03bd, where c is the phase velocity. In the case of a photon of an monochromatic light source this is equal to the speed of the photon itself: the speed of light. If c = c(\u03d1) is depending on the direction \u03d1, the wavelength of the laser would change, depending from which angle you are looking an the light source (remember: \u03bd cannot change, because it is determined by the quantum-mechanical transition of the emitting electron).<br><br>You see: perhabs we cannot measure the one-way speed of light directly, but would it be anisotropic it would cause a hell a amount of trouble.", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T01:55:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Renou", "comment_text": "I love how the shirt observation at the end becomes a dad joke.

His answer is that our ability to translate our own position (i.e. move) to offset the motion of another object, (i.e. keep its position on our retina the same), is what induces Euclidean geometry.

Proportions doesn&#39;t match, so besides the rotating madness it appears like it&#39;s stretching all over the place too, but by rotating it it gives brains too much to work with overwhelming critical thought, hence it&#39;s best figured out by stopping for a bit every once in a while.

Now, there is a question as to when all of the facts have been gathered, but this is a separate question. If, for this comment, we assume that all facts have been gathered, or all necessary facts have been gathered, on a  particular subject, then we can arrive to certainty on that subject. Humility and humbleness are not the correct character traits that should be advocated for, as they coverup the negative that is apparent inside a certain type of view. That view is false confidence. When one avoids, discards, disregards, dismisses, skips, is impatient, is lazy, is unethical, is irrational, and then proceeds to rest upon an immat<br>ure set of ideas, then one will arrive to false confidence. One can arrive to an immature set of ideas and not settle upon that set as the end, and so will not proceed as if they do have a complete set of ideas, but will proceed with certainty that one has certain ideas that can be confidently continued with and other ideas that need further proof.

I was clearly seeing it rotating, even at the start of the video, before learning what illusion to look out for. Can&#39;t really put my finger on what was clueing me in about rotation, and the illusion worked perfectly on the following smaller pieces.<br>Also, as one of my eyes is nearly blind, I lack all the binocular depth and movement clues, so monocular ones are better developed. Because of that, I often find myself failing to see some illusions other people say are very convincing, especially of the &quot;close one eye to see the illusion&quot; variety. On the other hand, I fall for some illusions that everyone else sees through (and sometimes see an illusion where none was intended at all). I never studied it much, but one general observation I have is this: it feels that monocular clues are much weaker at a distance, because compared to binocular people, I have no problem when dealing with things up close, but struggle even with basic distance/speed/shape estimations for distant objects. On the other hand, when a person with a binocular vision closes one eye, their perception becomes noticeably worse than mine.<br>I wonder if this is what happened in the South Africa study you mentioned: children had to rely only on monocular clues, which is something they weren&#39;t used to, and the increased distance made it only harder to perceive through the illusion.<br>And it also makes me wonder: the human brain is very plastic, and there are a lot of different visual clues it learn can use. If we had, say, a person that lived from birth locked in a bunker, surrounded by various illusions, would they be fooled by those illusions, or would they adapt? And when they would finally get out, would they be greatly confused by things we take for granted?

You can make adjustments around the room in all 360 deg for a starting vantage point, and all the different depths between those, and you can get a number of possibilities moving by approximately one atom at a time each. Its a lot of possibilities, sure, but its not infinite. <br> <br>If I were a PH.D. Mathematician I could probably figure out exactly how many possibilities there are. Its probably something like P! (a) = n(a)/n(v)  Where P! is the permutation sum and (a) is the number of atoms in the room and (v) is the number of different possible vantage points and (n) just stands for the (n)umber of times you use those positions. <br> <br>The P! basically means P which is probability but is limited by the number of combinations that eliminates the one before it. For instance, if you have 5 colored marbles all the same color, they can be reorganized with each marble being in a different position and the number of combinations available. This would be represented as (P)5 and 5 is (n). However if they are all 5 different colored marbles, it would be (P!)5 where the order of the marbles matters. Theres only so many combinations of green marble being at the start that you can have before it starts to repeat itself. You don&#39;t have to go through the entire set again of Green Red Blue, theres only two possible combinations with that start at the end with the last two Yellow and Black marbles. <br> <br>1,2,3,4,5<br>1,2,3,5,4<br>1,2,4,5,3<br>1,2,4,3,5<br>1,2,5,4,3<br>1,2,5,3,4<br>1,5,2,3,4<br>1,5,2,4,3<br>1,5,3,4,2<br>1,5,3,2,4<br>1,5,4,3,2<br>1,5,4,2,3<br><br>and so on I think you get the point.

The side the cube is attached to is the one with the short height, and opposite that side is the long height. The brain believes that short height must be further away from you, and conversely the long height must closest to you, despite the fact that the cube ought to theoretically break the brains expectations of what it should perceive. For some reason the brain perceives the dimensions of the trapezoid and processes them as either being closer or further away due to forced perspective ,and it also perceives the cube as a separate object.

We were able to predict when the supernova would appear in the images by calculating the distances the light was travelling to form the various images and using the commonly accepted velocity of light, thus confirming that the light coming  toward us travels at the same speed we measure in round trip experiments.<br><br>There is actually another, much simpler way to confirm the one way speed of light and that is to realize that the velocity of light in a vacuum is not a fundamental constant. The velocity of light in any medium, including its velocity in a vacuum, is a function of the permeability and permittivity of that medium. Since these values themselves are not direction dependent, they are a function of the medium itself at any given point, the velocity of light must necessarily also not be direction dependent.

Whether it&#39;s via anaglyph filtering, like red/blue or red/green glasses, or by polarization or active filtering done by a quick shutter (like quickly closing each eye alternatively) which have to sync with an also shuttering video feed, which alternates between to separate perspectives of the same scene. It&#39;s all about fooling the brain into believing it&#39;s looking at a scene that has DEPTH. You are simulating the Z-axis (our 3d world has three main axis, which is X <del>horizontal translation-displacement-, Y -vertical translation/displacement-, and Z which relates from a relative perspective -our viewpoint</del> translation/displacement to and away from us).<br><br>However, when it comes to anamorphic perspective (you are literally painting the 3 dimensions on a bidimensional horizontal plain), you will not be able to fool the brain, which is using a stereoscopic view (two points of view - two eyes). The same could probably be said about this illusion, which will work fine on a VIDEO (which has no depth, unless you are doing the anaglyph or VR thing), it&#39;s actually a projection on a vertical bidimensional plain (you just have the X and Y axis - the Z is just assumed, but your eyes+brain don&#39;t see it - that&#39;s why 3D movies are cool, you get to feel the immersion of a 3d experience by having an actual Z-axis your eyes+brain can process).<br>IF you cover one eye, then you are getting the SINGLE LENS effect you get from filming whatever and displaying on a non-3d display.<br>The secret for a LIVE-VIEW of this illusion is for people to be farther away, and use ONLY one eye. Or to see it within a video, from a single lens perspective.<br><br>So now to continue watching this video, and let&#39;s see if it went in the same direction as my musings :)", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:10:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajiv Pokharel", "comment_text": "2020/12/31  11:59pm......this illusion is crazy!!", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:10:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Vicencio", "comment_text": "Can black holes be?", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:09:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Barajas", "comment_text": "yess", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:09:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nemui", "comment_text": "Im trying to make up a clip in my mind of the illusion actually spinning normally lol", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AnatoleH1", "comment_text": "beautiful. thank you.", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CODE7x", "comment_text": "It tell me how hard i try i can controll my own brain to see it that way so who is really controlling brain hmm", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bikram", "comment_text": "I think this illusion is more strong when seen from camera as flat display doesn&#39;t give depth perception but is likely to be spotted with naked eye.", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SjakieNugh", "comment_text": "Now that the video is over, you can finally hang the disco ball and ... swing ... back", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christine LaBeach", "comment_text": "Dude you make excellent videos.", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haiqal Iskandar", "comment_text": "My eyes goes \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silvanus", "comment_text": "PLATO\u2019S CAVE ALLEGORY", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T18:08:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "O Circles", "comment_text": "Huh, the first time I couldn&#39;t see the illusion at all and really just saw it as a rotating thing, then I went back and now I can only see the oscillation.
