Play with the crossing of your eyes until you see it....its like a specific eye crossing. The pattern inside the light gets clearer. Now here is the interesting part! Try to get multiple light sources at the same time and notice the pattern inside them. Wether it is a street lamp or a car head light or even a phone charger light.....like an led....notice the pattern within the light source. You might notice....THEY ARE THE SAME PATTERN!

Interesting! So it doesn&#39;t matter that the sun is a light source or not, it&#39;s still the object being projected, hence the shape doesn&#39;t matter. Don&#39;t know why I had so much trouble understanding this at first. You write: &quot;Therefore the size and shape of the hole have  no effect on the size and shape of the image.&quot; So I tested that at home with a light bulb above and a piece of paper below. A big triangle hole in the paper produced a big sharp triangle shape on the ground (with sharp edges of the paper&#39;s shadow). But when I moved the paper up the image of the triangle shining through diffused and morphed into a round shape (while the papershadow and its edges started to diffuse and lose intensity/density). That means distance is the one defining factor here? Distance between object and pinhole and distance between pinhole and image? If so the entire process starts to make sense now and people in the comments complaining about the camera not being focussed overlooked the fact that increasing the distance between pinhole and wall means increasing the blurriness of the paper&#39;s shadow.

I have some fond memories of it from when I was a kid. The window to my room was facing an office building with big, glass windows. You could see everything going on in the office just by looking out. The usual, people going about their day, talking, walking, working, sitting or standing. But in the window of my room there were those really heavy-duty solar blinds that didn&#39;t permeate a lot of light, so in order to see those people I had to roll up the blinds and stare at them, which was kinda awkward and creepy now that I think about it. So one day I read about the camera obscura and so I punctured a hole in one of the blinds. Ever since then, every morning, with the right conditions, I could see a movie playing out on the wall of my room right opposite the window. All in reverse, like a strange, fairy-tale world where everything was upside down. It wasn&#39;t like a movie-quality sharp image or anything, but it was enough for me to see all the upside-down people going about their upside-down duties and their upside-down lives every morning. I imagined their struggle to eat and drink, to walk upside-down and to keep all of their possessions stuck to their desks nailed to the ceiling. It was like a glimpse into a world that was out there, but it was almost like you had to close your eyes to see it. A real world, in almost every sense of the word, but also so alien that it could only exist in my mind and nowhere else. A sensation more than fact, but based on something that was really there, something that I knew didn&#39;t violate any physical laws or logic. Just a completely different perspective on the same thing I saw when simply looking out the window. And now, every time I try and imagine what someone else sees and thinks, I go back to that feeling I got from looking at the image projected from my little camera obscura. That whatever I take for granted and know to be true can feel so alien and strange to another person. And I wish everyone else had a little camera obscura with them at all times.

When the sun shown through the leaves of a tree during a 98% partial eclipse where I was at, hundreds of images of the partial eclipse appeared everywhere, all over the place,  where there were tree leaf shadows. The same thing happens at night when walking under a tree with l.e.d. street lights above it shining through the leaves; the individual bulbs appear everywhere. The pinhole camera effect? Without an eclipse, look closely; it&#39;s the round sun image over lapping one another.", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T02:34:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arun J", "comment_text": "Click bait", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T02:26:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pucktechnology", "comment_text": "Cool do check out the shadows during partial eclipse of the sun", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T02:21:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glizzy Gladiator350", "comment_text": "Thanks YouTube, for recommending a 8 year old video.", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T02:01:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zorak Universo", "comment_text": "Dont worry people, the cameran was fired.

Now, by combining the reasons, you see more light is passing through the middle of the hole, while less is when you get closer to the edges, so all this would form a Circular shape on wall that you might think it&#39;s the Sun Image Inverted depending on the first phenomenon !<br><br>HOW TO PROVE MY POINT OF VIEW : well, one way to prove this is by getting a source of light <del>it could \u00a0be the sun light itself</del> and then put 2 of your fingers next to each other then try to get them closer &amp; notice the way their shadow would appear...<br>well, when they get closer just before they touch each other, you&#39;ll find that both of their shadows are attached to each other by a tiny line that gets bigger and it&#39;s caused by the small dust &amp; other micro small things on it. It&#39;s surely these things are very small, but when they attach, they absorb light and creates that illusion that the finger are attached to each other.<br><br><br>FEW MORE THINGS THAT AFFECT : As well as the angle of light passing through can change everything, connect things to others, or change the shape. The best way to get it is by making the light &amp; the shape or hole &amp; the wall all in the same line and an angle of 90* degrees.", "comment_date": "2015-05-20T12:40:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar St", "comment_text": "ok, i don`t understand this video", "comment_date": "2015-05-20T06:08:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShmEronMan", "comment_text": "are they braindead?", "comment_date": "2015-05-13T17:02:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bigbaggoyard", "comment_text": "But why ?", "comment_date": "2015-05-09T09:38:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rutramp", "comment_text": "So if the sun was a shape of a triangle, you would see a triangle on the wall?", "comment_date": "2015-04-25T19:39:33Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "LotusEater", "comment_text": "Hi Derek, i am very disappointed with this explanation of yours.<br><br>How can you ignore concept of focal length etc?
