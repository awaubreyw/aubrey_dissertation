When the balance is released, the pressure exerted on the water shifts to find its lowest state of energy.  Since the ping pong ball is suspended in the water, the water in it&#39;s vessel cannot move to accommodate any imbalance of pressure.  The Acrylic ball however is not in a fixed position in its vessel, so if there is an imbalance in the pressure the water can shift to accommodate.  Presumably since the ping pong ball has some small amount of mass, and the amount of water in the vessels is equal; the balance would be only slightly weighted towards the ping pong ball side in the absence of the acrylic ball.  When the Acrylic ball is introduced into the the other vessel displacing water it is under a buoyant force with the water and an imbalance of pressure is exerted on the water.  The barometric pressure on the water must be higher than the weight of the water which is being displaced by the Acrylic ball.  At sea level the barometric pressure is almost 15 lbs psi.  Since the amount of water being displaced is about 4 cubic inches it probably only weighs about 0.15 lbs, and the barometric pressure on the water is much greater than that.  So the scale tips towards the Acrylic ball because the barometric pressure put on the water applies a greater buoyant force on the acrylic ball.<br><br><br>Hope that makes some kind of sense.", "comment_date": "2020-01-22T02:12:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ilprediletto", "comment_text": "You never stop learning simple Physics!", "comment_date": "2019-09-18T17:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anna Curser", "comment_text": "the air in the pingpong was making the glass lighter.", "comment_date": "2019-06-06T14:02:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YuSaidIt", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ6GfBOYeLc&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a> - As all things should be", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T19:43:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ireneusz Kalicki", "comment_text": "Aun que vertieras m\u00e1s agua en el vaso con la pelota de ping-pong (se puede ver que hay m\u00e1s agua en el vaso) creo que igualmente el otro vaso seguir\u00eda m\u00e1s pesado ;)", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T18:11:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nikzig777", "comment_text": "would the viscosity of the fluid matter?  like if it was honey instead of water would the acrylic ball weigh down even more.", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T09:48:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vu Nguyen", "comment_text": "i saw it tilt to the right", "comment_date": "2017-06-25T01:54:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanjay Murji", "comment_text": "c", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T15:05:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amar Choudhary", "comment_text": "vsuace about this would have been better,", "comment_date": "2017-03-07T00:11:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Tone", "comment_text": "Cray-Zee", "comment_date": "2016-11-11T04:46:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis Persson", "comment_text": "Water is lazy (well, all systems with energy are). It will try to get some rest. When you push down the ping pong ball you do disturb the water&#39;s normally balanced state. It will therefore receive some potential energy (while rising) that it will use to try to stabilize itself to go back to its restful state. The ping pong ball is way to heavy to push when you are holding onto it, and the walls of the glass are also too robust. The only direction that the water may go is downward, and the force downwards will therefore be equal to the weight of the displaced water (plus the neglected weight of the ping pong ball). For the acrylic ball the situation is almost exactly the same. The scale will push the water upwards with the a force equal to the buoyant force. That force is less than the weight of the acrylic ball and the lazy water will therefore push downwards with all the energy it got, i.e. the buoyant force. The ball can&#39;t help to push at all since it&#39;s completely prevented from doing that by the string. So, the consequence is that the system remains balanced. However, in the first experiment where the ping pong ball was attached to the bottom of the cup, the water couldn&#39;t push on the scale. It will push on the bottom of the glass, but the glass will remain in rest because of the upward buoyant force from the string.

Not so much what you conclude, but how you say that these forces are acting and how you display this with arrows.\u00a0<br>The tension in the string on the left should be made by two equal and opposite forces: One that pulls in the ball and one that pulls in the glass, but none that affect the object of the glass as a whole. Then, as you said, the boyent force on the ball is accompanied by a downward pushing force on the water by the ball. Therefore this does not add any external force on the glass\u00a0and the only downward facing force left, acting on the glass is that of the pull of gravity on the mass and this is counteracted by the table pushing back underneath. What we call the normal force.\u00a0<br>This object is easily explained by most engineers who has had statics education, as one of the things said in the first lesson is: &quot;Start by looking at the profile of the object and add external forces before we later on learn about internal forces&quot;. The pull of gravity is an external force and so is the normal force acted by the table. These external forces are the same if the ball floats on top of the water or are tied down.<br>The reason why the students you asked are having trouble are that they haven&#39;t drawn all the forces, that they misjudge the size of the forces or that there are simply too many forces drawn on, that they cannot comprehend it in their head. They are on a level so high that they are used to looking at internal forces and they forgot to only look at the external ones.<br><br>Anyway, when you then push on top of the ball, you introduce another external force equal to the boyance at the top, which makes a total downward force on the left glass of the pull of gravity plus the force you are pushing down with, which is equal to the boyancy of the ball. :)<br><br>Now on to the right one.<br>The forces acting on the ball is the pull of gravity down, boyancy up and tension in the string, up. The tension in the string equals gravity minus boyancy, but still, the ball are in equilibrium as long as the tension in the string is below the yeld strength.<br>The external forces acting on the glass of water is a downward force of boyancy because of newtons third law, as you mentioned, and a force of gravity. This is counteracted by a normal force by the table and then the object is at rest.\u00a0<br><br>Then when you release the balance, the one with the bigger pull downward will create a bigger moment about the pivot, making the balance lean in that direction.\u00a0<br>Therefore, the case of the first video: As long as the pull of gravity on the white ball is less than the boyancy and the weight (pull of gravity upon the mass) of the blue ball is greater than the boyancy, the balance will fall towards the blue ball.\u00a0<br>To get this in total balance, the weight of the white ball would have to be equal to the boyancy, there would be no tension in the string and the ball would be floating freely in the water. Had the weight of the white ball been more than the boyancy, it would be on the floor and the balance would fall towards the white ball.\u00a0<br><br>In this video, when you push on the ball, you are acting on a force which is equal to the boyancy of the white ball, but we still see a slight drop towards the blue ball, because the depth of the white and blue ball are no longer the same and the boyancy of the white ball are now lower than that of the blue until the glass with the blue has fallen a bit and the boyancy on the blue ball is smaller. :)<br><br><br>So....

The lateral pressure on the sides is equal around the circumference of the beaker in all directions, with a net resultant of zero, and therefore may be ignored. The pressure on the base of the beaker is proportional to the depth of water above it, which \u2013 multiplied by the area of the base \u2013 gives a force downward on the beaker, and thus downward on the scales.<br>In experiment 1 both beakers have equal depth of water, so equal downward force due to water pressure alone. The reason the ping-pong beaker rose was because this beaker had an additional force upward from the tension of the ball due to buoyancy, which partially offset the downward force due to water pressure.<br>In experiment 2, there is no such tension on the beaker base \u2013 both beaker bases have only (equal) downward water pressure. The act of pushing the ping-pong ball downward simply displaced water, increasing the effective depth, which increases the pressure on the base (thus the force), until it equaled that of the beaker with the suspended ball.<br>I find this way of thinking about it easier, though perhaps less instructive as (with the exception of acknowledging the ball buoyancy causing tension in the tether in the first experiment) it dodges the question of what forces are acting on the balls themselves.<br>Really enjoy your videos by the way mate, good stuff.", "comment_date": "2015-05-13T03:51:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frost Cuber", "comment_text": "Hello, I am working on a question that I cannot seem to figure out.

Strings and buoyancy is nice and all, but the air within the ping pong ball would add an extra upwards force to the ping pong ball, one that the acrylic ball does not receive, thus making the acrylic ball descend and the ping pong ball go up. Another way of explaining this is by stating that the air adds an upwards force to the ping pong ball that is not counteracted by any (extra) upper force on the acrylic ball, nor counteracted by a downwards force on the ping pong ball. Either one of these should keep the balls even.<br><br>As in regards for the downwards force placed on the ping pong ball with your fingers, this simply causes the balls to stay even due to the fact the downward push with your fingers negate the upward force of the air in the ping pong ball. This is stated in the previous paragraph as if a downwards force was applied on the ping pong ball (in this case the fingers) then the balls would be even, which seems to be the case. If this balance between air and fingers is balanced, they cancel out, therefor, the only left on both sides is the -F(b) and the F(b) \u00a0on both sides, which also cancel each other out.<br><br>One simple follow up experiment that can be done to see if my refined hypothesis on this phenomenon is true would be to accurately measure the upwards force placed by the air in the ping pong ball (yet to make sure not to accidentally include the upwards force of the buoyancy) , and somehow add this same force to the acrylic ball.<br><br>I hope this reaches\u00a0Veritasium and can bring an idea on why I believe his interpretation for this experiment is incorrect.<br><br>For everyone else, and including Veritasium, helpful criticism is welcome! :)", "comment_date": "2015-05-12T01:31:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BNL07604", "comment_text": "Ha!
