My grandma pull up a list of chemicals and #1 chemical was Agent Orange in his system... that was killed over 500+ on these ships that surround the island and watched the blast.

This was another place the astronauts were trained in geology, and lunar buggies were tested. Again, similar terrain to the moon, but also the rocks from shield volcanoes like those in Hawai\u2018i are geochemically very similar to Lunar and Martian regolith!

The light coloured deposits shown are expalined as being ejecta from volcanoes outside the mares but that surely makes them very rare finds. <br>Also we have moon rocks landing on earth each year so why did we send fighter pilots to get more samples from the moon?<br>You state that the missions were scientific in nature, but what discovery did science make definitively from them?

Can you honestly hold that such information was really gathered from Apollo?<br>What was discovered outside of what we already knew? <br>Do you believe all the claims made by Apollo? Do you still believe the moon is as dry as was claimed?

For the more likely reason of making the Hoax seem possible. Propaganda. No way should it be remotely possible to be in a vicinity of 920 Nuclear detentions. Homeboy should be feeling the Lymphoma kicking in. If this was for training purposes I would expect them to be testing the full suits abilities to shield them from radiation. But they don&#39;t. Did they test the ability for the suits to keep them alive in the vacuum of space? Once, that man nearly died in the first ten seconds in the NASA vac chamber. He stated afterwards he was fine, untill the spit in his mouth began to bubble. The lander was tested very few times, Buzz almost died in a prototype. All of them had no success. They never tested one for  landing from the distance they dropped from and they had no idea as to the conditions and variables involved because they were never there prior. Even in the lower amount of Gravity with the deep layer of dust allegedly on the moon, none of it is kicked up by the lander coming or going. Any dust would also take quite a long time to settle. As he said they had some exposure and it&#39;s just part of the job. Well they should have had to get through the radiation belt which is said to be an incredibly lethal bombardment of radiation. But they can&#39;t remember how they did it without never once discussing it, documenting it or testing it I could see why. How is it they can say they destroyed everything that made the whole thing possible? No footage or photos. No blue prints or diagrams. Not even a patent when everything they ever invented has patents. For the first time in decades and only this year have they decided to go back to the moon. So what&#39;s changed? Did they just remember how they did it? Did they find a cocktail napkin with the designs for all the missing information to create the tech necessary? <br>The physics involved in the creation of the craters lacks a distinct lapse in judgement. How does so many objects from Space impact on a sphere perfectly dead center so as to create a perpendicular strike that many times? I would believe there would be more long impact craters than perfect dead on craters we see. There&#39;s also a very odd lack in parallax of circular craters closer to the outer edges nor is there a visible elevation or declination directly on the edges, like a bite of a cookie, it&#39;s always perfect and crisp on the edges. Just as mysterious is the behavior of light coming from the moon we still see a visible difference between the outside of the craters and the hole of them, if light was being shined on the moon from the sun how is it just a darker grey on the insides? Also the lack of a Ozone layer and other atmospheric conditions the moon doesn&#39;t have (at least not as thick and full as ours) the sun would be so intense and bright welding eye protection would useless, the imaging equipment wouldn&#39;t be able to record squat. Shouldn&#39;t it be just as bright as the surrounding areas? If you were flying over the craters in Nevada at high noon when directly over one you wouldn&#39;t hardly notice it, unable to gain depth perception. But on the moon its an even grey tone, it should be darker at the center, showing depth in a cone. Yet what we see could be flat across the whole thing.. But the mother of all evidences involved with the moon not being what we are told is HOW DID SO MANY CRATERS GET CREATED ON THE SIDE OF THE MOON FACING EARTH IF THEY&#39;RE MADE BY METEOR IMPACT? How did a meteor get in between Earth and the moon, then have the momentum to be unaffected by the Earth&#39;s Gravity, then make that perfect angle for a perfect impact crater on a sphere? It&#39;s all the more perplexing that the images we have of the dark side of the Moon,(btw I think the images in question I&#39;m mentioning are fake anyway) you&#39;ll find there&#39;s a fraction of the craters on it. Even the other sides, every bit of it not faceing the Earth has less than a quarter of the craters. So how does the side that&#39;s completely inaccessible tho be struck get struck more than the entire 75% that is? Any argument of it used to be rotating faster or pretty much anything else claimed it was not doing what it does now and that&#39;s allowed it to be exposed on all sides at one point in time. To that I ask why isn&#39;t there a more even distribution of the craters? To that I also call BS as no one has aquired evidence there of.", "comment_date": "2019-07-20T07:53:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MalfunctionM1Ke", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7uGvsT_nnM&amp;t=11m00s\">11:00</a> Flat earth confirmed!", "comment_date": "2019-07-20T07:53:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Davies", "comment_text": "Pfft, proved that crater was from a meror.
