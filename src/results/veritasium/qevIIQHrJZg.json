Then maybe over time the pressure would fall as other systems of the body adapted. The greatest threat then for a person losing a limb would be this pressure trying to regrow the limb in the short term.

However, I have a feeling that they are ultimately going to find that the pressures required to keep the patient&#39;s airway and alveoli open may be radically different than that required to keep the tube itself from collapsing in on itself and essentially, resulting in the tube being sucked-out of the patient&#39;s airway.<br>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe that they can find a solution to such an issue.

Throughout my career I worked at various times with a gentleman named Bill Bryan. He is best and maybe least known for his role as the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in the original Ghost Busters film. He was the performer in the suit he created for the role. Over the years Bill created amazing creatures, and elements of creatures using the exact techniques employed to actuate the vine robot. The creations were primarily fabricated from plastic bags seamed together with various incarnations of a soldering iron. I made several soldering iron tips for him that included a small brass wheel that could be rolled over the plastic in intricate patterns. So as opposed to creating the shape that the tube assumes after the fact, he created the shape integral to the tube. It took a lot of engineering and the results were mind blowing. Many of his designs included a piece of monofilament line attached to the end of the shape on the inside so the shape could be rapidly inflated and retracted. The source of inflation and deflation was almost always a shop vacuum because they were inexpensive and provided enough volume of air that multiple creatures or elements could be operated simultaneously. This was accomplished with a simple valve that we crafted from plastic and pvc fittings that employed both the vacuum and the exhaust from the shop vac. By alternating the valve ports with the vac and exhaust you could instantly change from blow to suck and vise versa. The sound guys hated us because it was almost impossible to record dialog when our effects were being used. We found creative ways of blimping the shop vacs or moving them off stage.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br><br>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.<br><br>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.<br><br>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.<br><br>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.<br><br>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.<br><br>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.<br><br>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.<br><br>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.<br><br>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.<br><br>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.<br><br>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.<br><br>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.<br><br>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:<br><br>For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:<br><br>For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:<br><br>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:<br><br>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:<br><br>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:<br><br>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences<br><br>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:<br><br>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:<br><br>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.<br><br>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.<br><br>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.<br><br>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.<br><br>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.<br><br>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.<br><br>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br><br>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.<br><br>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T16:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OXDXMX", "comment_text": "Make an unstoppable robot they said.

This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other &quot;longest texts ever&quot; on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! This is going to be a WORLD RECORD! This is actually my third attempt at doing this. The first time, I didn&#39;t save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now I&#39;m writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won&#39;t get lost somehow. Anyways, let&#39;s talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There&#39;s a Teen Titans Go episode called &quot;Waffles&quot; where the word &quot;Waffles&quot; is said a hundred-something times. It&#39;s pretty annoying. There&#39;s also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don&#39;t know what Pig Latin is? It&#39;s a language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel, move them to the end, and add &#39;-ay&#39; to the end. If the word begins with a vowel, you just add &#39;-way&#39; to the end. For example, &quot;Waffles&quot; becomes &quot;Afflesway&quot;. I&#39;ve been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes. It&#39;s pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That&#39;s never actually happened before, but if it ever does, &#39;twill be pretty funny. By the way, &quot;&#39;twill&quot; is a word I invented recently, and it&#39;s a contraction of &quot;it will&quot;. I really hope it gains popularity in the near future, because &quot;&#39;twill&quot; is WAY more fun than saying &quot;it&#39;ll&quot;. &quot;It&#39;ll&quot; is too boring. Nobody likes boring. This is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing this a decade later, who knows? But right now, it&#39;s not very long. But I&#39;ll just keep writing until it is the longest! Have you ever heard the song &quot;Dau Dau&quot; by Awesome Scampis? It&#39;s an amazing song. Look it up on YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin. I think you already knew that. Whatever. I think I&#39;m gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I&#39;m back now. I&#39;m gonna contribute more to this soon-to-be giant wall of text. I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot his name. I&#39;m pretty sure it was something stupid though. I think it was &quot;FROG&quot; in Morse Code or something. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but I&#39;m not very good at it. I&#39;m also not very good at French. I barely know anything in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But I&#39;m learning it, at least. I&#39;m also learning Esperanto. It&#39;s this language that was made up by some guy a long time ago to be the &quot;universal language&quot;. A lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of this text is probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it&#39;s long! Ha, get it? As LONG as it&#39;s LONG? I&#39;m so funny, right? No, I&#39;m not. I should probably get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I&#39;m back again. I basically have only two interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought you knew I was a furry. Haha, oops. Anyway, yeah, I&#39;m a furry, but since I&#39;m a young furry, I can&#39;t really do as much as I would like to do in the fandom. When I&#39;m older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I&#39;m honestly very desperate for this to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watching nothing but fursuit unboxings. I think I need help. This one time, me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn&#39;t end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises, and that she didn&#39;t wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay, hopefully I won&#39;t have to talk about furries anymore. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a furry reading this right now, I just don&#39;t wanna have to torture everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the rest of this entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one that I just used six times, not the one that you&#39;re probably thinking of which I have not used throughout this entire text. I just realised that next year will be 2020. That&#39;s crazy! It just feels so futuristic! It&#39;s also crazy that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought be a lot of memories. In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It&#39;ll be sad to see it go. I&#39;m gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I&#39;ll expain what Toki Pona is after I come back. Bye! I&#39;m back now, and I decided not to do it on Toki Pona, since many other people have done Toki Pona video lessons already. I decided to do it on Viesa, my English code. Now, I shall explain what Toki Pona is. Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language that has only ~120 words! That means you can learn it very quickly. I reccomend you learn it! It&#39;s pretty fun and easy! Anyway, yeah, I might finish my video about Viesa later. But for now, I&#39;m gonna add more to this giant wall of text, because I want it to be the longest! It would be pretty cool to have a world record for the longest text ever. Not sure how famous I&#39;ll get from it, but it&#39;ll be cool nonetheless. Nonetheless. That&#39;s an interesting word. It&#39;s a combination of three entire words. That&#39;s pretty neat. Also, remember when I said that I said the F word six times throughout this text? I actually messed up there. I actually said it ten times (including the plural form). I&#39;m such a liar! I struggled to spell the word &quot;liar&quot; there. I tried spelling it &quot;lyer&quot;, then &quot;lier&quot;. Then I remembered that it&#39;s &quot;liar&quot;. At least I&#39;m better at spelling than my sister. She&#39;s younger than me, so I guess it&#39;s understandable. &quot;Understandable&quot; is a pretty long word. Hey, I wonder what the most common word I&#39;ve used so far in this text is. I checked, and appearantly it&#39;s &quot;I&quot;, with 59 uses! The word &quot;I&quot; makes up 5% of the words this text! I would&#39;ve thought &quot;the&quot; would be the most common, but &quot;the&quot; is only the second most used word, with 43 uses. &quot;It&quot; is the third most common, followed by &quot;a&quot; and &quot;to&quot;. Congrats to those five words! If you&#39;re wondering what the least common word is, well, it&#39;s actually a tie between a bunch of words that are only used once, and I don&#39;t wanna have to list them all here. Remember when I talked about waffles near the beginning of this text? Well, I just put some waffles in the toaster, and I got reminded of the very beginnings of this longest text ever. Okay, that was literally yesterday, but I don&#39;t care. You can&#39;t see me right now, but I&#39;m typing with my nose! Okay, I was not able to type the exclamation point with just my nose. I had to use my finger. But still, I typed all of that sentence with my nose! I&#39;m not typing with my nose right now, because it takes too long, and I wanna get this text as long as possible quickly. I&#39;m gonna take a break for now! Bye! Hi, I&#39;m back again. My sister is beside me, watching me write in this endless wall of text. My sister has a new thing where she just says the word &quot;poop&quot; nonstop. I don&#39;t really like it. She also eats her own boogers. I&#39;m not joking. She&#39;s gross like that. Also, remember when I said I put waffles in the toaster? Well, I forgot about those and I only ate them just now. Now my sister is just saying random numbers. Now she&#39;s saying that they&#39;re not random, they&#39;re the numbers being displayed on the microwave. Still, I don&#39;t know why she&#39;s doing that. Now she&#39;s making annoying clicking noises. Now she&#39;s saying that she&#39;s gonna watch Friends on three different devices. Why!?!?! Hi its me his sister. I&#39;d like to say that all of that is not true. Max wants to make his own video but i wont let him because i need my phone for my alarm.POOP POOP POOP POOP LOL IM FUNNY. kjnbhhisdnhidfhdfhjsdjksdnjhdfhdfghdfghdfbhdfbcbhnidjsduhchyduhyduhdhcduhduhdcdhcdhjdnjdnhjsdjxnj Hey, I&#39;m back. Sorry about my sister. I had to seize control of the LTE from her because she was doing keymash. Keymash is just effortless. She just went back to school. She comes home from school for her lunch break. I think I&#39;m gonna go again. Bye! Hello, I&#39;m back. Let&#39;s compare LTE&#39;s. This one is only 8593 characters long so far. Kenneth Iman&#39;s LTE is 21425 characters long. The Flaming-Chicken LTE (the original) is a whopping 203941 characters long! I think I&#39;ll be able to surpass Kenneth Iman&#39;s not long from now. But my goal is to surpass the Flaming-Chicken LTE. Actually, I just figured out that there&#39;s an LTE longer than the Flaming-Chicken LTE. It&#39;s Hermnerps LTE, which is only slightly longer than the Flaming-Chicken LTE, at 230634 characters. My goal is to surpass THAT. Then I&#39;ll be the world record holder, I think. But I&#39;ll still be writing this even after I achieve the world record, of course. One time, I printed an entire copy of the Bee Movie script for no reason. I heard someone else say they had three copies of the Bee Movie script in their backpack, and I got inspired. But I only made one copy because I didn&#39;t want to waste THAT much paper. I still wasted quite a bit of paper, though. Now I wanna see how this LTE compares to the Bee Movie script. Okay, I checked, and the Bee Movie script is 50753 characters long. Not as long as some of the LTEs I mentioned, but still", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T05:54:36Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Your Probably Wrong", "comment_text": "hear me out..............................", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T05:54:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Indrid Cold", "comment_text": "This is like the exhaust jack I have in my automobile.

And this energy is transfered by the above mentioned specefic movement of particles of medium.<br><br>Now, The question is, to &quot;move&quot; the particles of medium in that way, Some energy is must required. So, dose that means the energy traveling through a wave gose on decreasing slowly? And one thing more, what is the state of this energy which is travelling through the wave and moving through the particles of the medium? of Course it is not solid, fluid, plasma. It Seems similar to gaseous state. So, is<br>energy a gas without any molecular structure?<br><br>In Dominoes game, when we apply force or give energy to the first Dominoe, it falls on other dominoe and transfers that energy to  it. 2nd  dominoe falls on 3rd, 3rd falls on 4th and so on.

(I.e., a tall adult man and a short female child will likely have different distances from the opening of the mouth to the trachea, so if it pops off the side RIGHT at the right spot for ONE, it likely will come out in the wrong spot on the other.  I suspect people will still be using something like the King LT-D dual-lumen airway for a while still to come.  (IIRC, that doesn&#39;t actually require a laryngoscope, anyway, which is the point of the dual-lumen approach.  You can do it blind; if you jam the end in the esophagus, you just attach your BVM-D or whatever into the OTHER tube.)  I <b>DO</b> wonder, though... if you have a patient presenting with a completely blocked airway (due to swelling of tissues around the trachea during anaphylaxis, for example, that would normally require an emergency cricothyrotomy,) could a vine-robot force its way PAST that, and would that do LESS damage, ultimately, to the patient, than the &quot;e-cric,&quot; or, in layman&#39;s terms, opening the throat to re-establish a patent airway in someone who can&#39;t breathe?  (Forgive me if my information is out of date; I left the field over a decade ago, and I haven&#39;t really kept up.  I assume they&#39;re still using these techniques when someone can&#39;t breathe for reasons like anaphylaxis and the like.)", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T05:10:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L Marcotte", "comment_text": "When you see your crush", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T05:08:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Egil Troubadour", "comment_text": "Nightmare fuel and tentacle jokes aside, this is a pretty simple yet cool idea.", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T04:55:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lakshya Bansal", "comment_text": "Please make a video on perpetual motion...", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T04:05:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Band", "comment_text": "Seems like the robot got viagra", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T03:49:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "QWE", "comment_text": "My Robot grows 7inches every morning.. \ud83d\ude04", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T03:38:45Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sage Becenti", "comment_text": "I know there are some ethots looking at this thinking of new subscribers.", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T03:31:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DIO SAMA", "comment_text": "This reminds me of Doctor Octopus", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T03:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Mceuin", "comment_text": "I dont like the way this thing gets longer, it&#39;s disturbing", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T03:00:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Caleb Hamm", "comment_text": "These niggas made a balloon and yall losing your minds over it.", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T02:43:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That one dude \u2022-\u2022", "comment_text": "Is this another one of those \u201clife saving generation changing technologies\u201d that we never hear about ever again?", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T02:39:27Z", "likes_count": 511}, {"comment_by": "Jeff\u2019s Dioramas", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve had a couple of heart attacks, last one I needed stents put in to open my artery which the consultants will tell you isn\u2019t an easy job.

The way to synchronize their shut off would be a physical string attached to each clock as they move in seperate direction. When the string gets pulled tight, the clocks stop, then observe the time that they stopped at and look for a difference. Then repeat in multiple directions. Also you could synchronize the clocks using string in the first place, those I\u2019m sure there are issues with string specifically, using some form of physical connection between the two clock to start at the same time should be possible?

You have the robot burrow in to where you want it to be and then you pump liquid concrete into it so that it solidifies into a loadbearing structure.  Might also be useful for running cables through the walls of a building. You could guide the robot around obstacles to where you wanted to go perhaps with the cable already in the center of the robot.  Might also be useful in inspecting and perhaps even cleaning out air ducks in homes and businesses.  Could also be used for the inspection of any type of piping, sewage pipes, oil pipes, natural gas pipes, etc.  I also almost forgot to mention that the inflatable muscles might be useful in creating pressure suits for astronauts that are easier for them to move around in because an inflatable muscle is helping them to bend the joint.", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T19:01:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Musa G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc", "comment_text": "please please add the turkish cc \u0131 want to watching this channel", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:58:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "chrisssinstockholm", "comment_text": "Square inch &amp; PSI \ud83d\ude2e<br>I thought at least engineers would use metric units.", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:56:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adan Okivas", "comment_text": "Tunnel mining", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:54:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "richandmeaty", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qevIIQHrJZg&amp;t=1m30s\">1:30</a> I had ptsd of graboids.", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:53:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cbru 8383xx", "comment_text": "Honestly, intubation was definitely something I wouldn&#39;t like, and after hearing some stories it&#39;s not pleasant either, however this definitely seems significantly more appealing and comfortable, and while it&#39;d probably feel weirder, it would be less painful and faster.", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:40:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ABROham Productions", "comment_text": "This looks like the water snake toys", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:40:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ruben Braekman", "comment_text": "There is no way some guy invented this by looking at a plant lol", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albert Jackinson", "comment_text": "Now THIS is absolutely awesome biomimickry!", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:37:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reapersbeach", "comment_text": "...wheredoigetoneofthese", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T18:30:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fredo", "comment_text": "Finally I can put some of these in a room with a cute anime girl!

Intubation requires a couple of things: the correct placement, isolation of the airway, and enough rigidity to apply suction without the tube collapsing. This seems like it would ventilate okay under positive pressure, but its lacking any type of cuff (inflatable rubber balloon around the tip of an ET tube) to prevent vomit, blood and other undesirable things from making their way down into the airway. However, given that this system here runs on positive pressure, that seems like it would be an easy addition. The bigger concern is the inability to use suction: its common that you need to suction secretions out of the airway and tube of a patient who is intubated, and this material would seemingly not be capable of handling that. I also have concerns about its lack of rigidity on unusual anatomies and trauma patients where you might be pushing through something to get into the airway. Also, we need to not stack breaths: ie return to ambient atmospheric pressure to allow the pts lungs to empty: would this system collapse when the compressor is turned off?

However, in regards to using this for intubations; <br>In current intubations, the endotracheal tube has a cuff on the end to help seal the airway from debris above it (such as vomit), and is a rigid plastic tube to prevent compression when it&#39;s attached to a ventilator. A clear deficiency in this soft robot design with be the lack of a rigid plastic (which would mean that it could still be blocked) and it doesn&#39;t have the end balloon to help seal it against foreign bodies (which would mean you could choke). One of the most important reasons people are intubated is to prevent such material (such as vomit) from occluding your airway, and to me it seems like such a soft endotracheal tube inherently cannot perform such an important function. Perhaps there may be revisions, presumably it&#39;d also have to be compatible with the ventilator that it needs to load onto, but I&#39;d imagine this is is going to be far from an easy task", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:18:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jujutsu_Kaisen", "comment_text": "Thanks for 300\ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\ude4f<br>Now please make it 320  !\u2763\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17<br>Thankyou...\ud83d\udc96..love you all army !\u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:15:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jujutsu_Kaisen", "comment_text": "Thanks for 300\ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\ude4f<br>Now please make it 320  !\u2763\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17<br>Thankyou...\ud83d\udc96..love you all army !\u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:15:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jujutsu_Kaisen", "comment_text": "Thanks for 300\ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\ude4f<br>Now please make it 320  !\u2763\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17<br>Thankyou...\ud83d\udc96..love you all army !\u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:15:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jujutsu_Kaisen", "comment_text": "Thanks for 300\ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\ude4f<br>Now please make it 320  !\u2763\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17<br>Thankyou...\ud83d\udc96..love you all army !\u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:15:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mior", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qevIIQHrJZg&amp;t=6m03s\">6:03</a><br><br>That kinda sus", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:11:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mineland", "comment_text": "I know this isn&#39;t directly you know what, but it feels like you know what", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:11:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanjeev Binaykia", "comment_text": "Can this soft tube technique be used for Covid-19 patients who need ventilator support?", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T12:09:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan R.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife . <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours.

I could see that in cave rescues being useful, for floods, and trapped people, and or giving support.<br><br>The interesting shape design technically if you create a mobile unit maker, that fabricates the shape on site, it can be used a per basis, with a additional limited mobility. Small copper pads and heat can utilize other materials to cause tension stretch to help/ assist it in turning or moving without melting the system. Or other forms also. <br>The only problem in cave rescuing is the added pressure if the person is stuck or can&#39;t move, but this can be a benefit also. IE the known crush of per human per volume of each region could assist in crushing the the person intentionally since their trapped and then release the pressure in and out to allow them to inch by inch move out. IE, common places of getting stuck is the lip of the ribcage going backwards. BY compression them back the ribcage could be pushed back as a lever assist and then deflated and the person should be able to manage getting out. However, portable pneumatics for surgery are available and could be used for cave rescues for the last.. 50- plus years. So the medical world already has  a mechanical controlled snake design. So a inflatable system is great and inexpensive, but still requires power. The colonoscopy tools, type, could be used for rescue mining, the unit and power source would have to be survival basis, so there is other things of energy means so you don&#39;t run out. you can literally just  create a dust grind system of removing rock whilst sucking out the debris... The speed of the device and setup, would have be at site deployment, less than 5 minutes ( plug and play), ideally 20 seconds or less. Then be  able to remove a the volume of 3 adult humans of rock to dust in 10 minutes would be ideal, Hitting the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qevIIQHrJZg&amp;t=3m33s\">3:33</a> minute which would suffice to avoid brain damage. Then the unit weight and means of carry, would be a pack etc.. but of course rope is always great.. and barrier system to not attack the person but a slinky cam would work also... basically a mighty Earth boring mechanical worm :). this is a safety means which has many other applications. Spelunking... 100 metre distance...<br>300 feet. of course a top side device could be made in a actual mobile unit.... and its distance and boring speed could be increased... IE unlimited depth.. boring speed... 3 vans sizes of earth per minute of normalized rock. ore. However, the means of removing the rock can be top based or energy based, but energy has its problems. Using some old mining teqniques of alternating sound hammering to easily chew through the earth, like a those like... ratchet trilling bugs in the sea... effective means of munching and cooling itself... <br><br>As for a inexpensive means for something.. else say a unit that would cost.. to do what you want it to do... 1.2 million or 600k ...... the largest cost is engineering the maintaining of its power, while reducing its weight. which often increase the selected materials... since survival is at stake the cost is irrelevant...  one never spares an expense at life... but apparently whatever this world is forming itself into, is something quite opposed to survival.", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T19:09:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Daniel Evans \ud83c\udfb8", "comment_text": "That&#39;s some PJs to envy", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T19:07:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ludwig von Me \u2022", "comment_text": "Pretty interesting", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T19:03:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Icejjfish225 Tbone 225", "comment_text": "The women in the comments", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T18:59:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tallaussiebloke", "comment_text": "So...&quot;snakes&quot; from a &quot;peanut brittle&quot; tin are now a robot? \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T18:59:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse Allen", "comment_text": "That thumbnail got me to click finally.

It will be able to move around pseudorandomly until it finds a tree when it starts trying to cut down the tree. It will use the wood either as fuel for the fire inside of it, to continue its own development, or to start building its copy. It will use smoke from the fire inside it to power the first gear so that it can move around.\r<br>Part III - Life Cycle\r<br>The life of the machine will start when its parent drops the new creature out of its top and lights the fire inside the new machine. It starts out looking for a tree to chop down and when it finds one it uses it as fuel and it will keep looking for fuel until it decides to go onto the second stage of its life. It finds a tree and drills out a hole for it to use as its shell. This shell will be to make sure the new machine it starts to make doesn&#39;t fall out before it is complete. When it does it will still continue to look for wood for its new copy and its own fuel. When it is done making its new copy its drops it down and starts the fire inside it only to immediately start working on a new one.\r<br>Part IV - How does Replication Work\r<br>The way the replication works is entirely encoded in the tape. The tape only encodes how to build the machine, nothing else. As the machine gathers wood in the second phase of its life, it runs the tape through a builder who reads all of the instructions and does exactly what the tape says. There will be parts of the tape that say to wait for more wood to come in before continuing. \r<br>\r<br>On the next step the machine will run the tape through a copier which will create a near identical copy of the tape to feed into the new machine and after that everything will be complete.\r<br>\r<br>Part V - How does the Logic Work\r<br>For the logic we will need a turing complete system that can run mostly on gears. And for that we will use the functionally complete not or system of logic.\r<br>\r<br>Not gate\r<br>\r<br>The not gate is easy, all that is needed to negate an input is a gear directly connected to the fire which is turning in the opposite direction of the gear we want to negate, this only works if some gears can move without forcing all connected gears to also move which is not hard to do\r<br>\r<br>Or gate\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>The gate is almost just as easy. All you need is two gears both connected to the third gear in such a way that it can only flow in one direction which is also not hard to do.\r<br>\r<br>Part VI - Other Materials\r<br>For this to actually be useful it needs to be able to work with materials other than wood, and the only part that is actually wood dependent is the fire so in order to do this with any other material all you need is a new energy source that can power gears. If there&#39;s any flammable resource in the area it is possible to use that, for example it&#39;s possible to imagine one made of dirt with a grass or leaf fire. However two situations where this would be very interesting would be underground mining for resources, or on the surface of mars to help terraform the planet. \r<br>\r<br>Underground an obvious resource is coal which is preferred because it can keep burning for a long time and on mars there is tons of geothermal energy which can easily be used to keep any machine running.

OK yes, I agree that lots of folks miss very obvious things all the time but when lots of people are working with something the chance that all of them miss obvious applications should go down with the number of people involved. And a LOT of folks have been working with air compressors and soft materials mentioned here like nylon for decades. As stated in the video, these are cheap materials and really have been for quite some time. So the next question to ask becomes is there a systemic reason why these applications have not been taken advantage of previously?<br><br>My guess is that the popping problem might be a bigger issue than the video suggests. Sure, some holes are survivable for these tubes as long as it&#39;s not more than the compressor can handle but then you&#39;ve got cases like where the host did manage to pop that air pillow he stood on. Consider what might be problems there. In clearing out rubble you may lift some, the balloon pops and the re-collapse might be more dangerous to survivors than just a stable rubble pile. Or intubating a patient and a popped tube sends fabric into the lungs. Maybe these are solvable or maybe there are issues I can&#39;t think of, but I&#39;m personally quite skeptical of folks finding &quot;one weird trick&quot; that uses well known technologies in a modern world where millions of people have been trying to find such easy and useful applications for decades.

It would grow right past thick branches and when it encountered a thinner one, it would leave the main trunk, and start climbing the branch. <br><br>I sat there trying to figure out why it would do this, and after a while I noticed that when the vine extended beyond the end of the branch, it would often find another branch, bridge the gap, and continue climbing that one.<br><br>So, I reasoned that the plant must have evolved to favor smaller branches because smaller branches wave about more vigorously in the wind than thicker branches do, and so this would increase the chances that the end of the vine would grapple and catch another structure to continue growing onward.<br><br>The next question became what biological mechanism pulls a vine toward a thinner branch, without pulling it away from the main trunk when it encounters a thicker branch, considering that the thicker branches are thinnner than the trunk that the vine is already climbing. <br><br>My best theory is that the vine responds to vibrations from thinner branches as they blow in the wind. Maybe the small oscillations have a ratcheting effect on cell growth, causing the cells at the end of the vine to grow faster when they&#39;re vibrating at some minimum amplitude. <br><br>Anyway, I did no experimentation.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019.", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T23:09:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anthony", "comment_text": "Just the tip", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T23:08:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RogerDavis795", "comment_text": "The inventor of vine robot must have watched WAR OF THE WORLDS with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning.", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T23:04:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nwstraith", "comment_text": "Could you dislodge a ship stuck in a canal with this?

So many factors come into play as to how difficult an airway is. 4) finally, we already have a &quot;tube&quot;-like structure for intubation, it&#39;s called a fiberoptic intubation. We control a camera on a semi flexible tube that is connected to a screen and we &quot;drive&quot; it towards and through the vocal cords. While the idea they have to design this towards intubation is good, without human guidance, I&#39;m not sure how different it would be to a blind intubation (which often ends up going into the esophagus). With human guidance, it might as well be a fiberoptic intubation, which we already have.

Moreover, medications can be administered directly into the lungs when using an ET tube, and suctioning can also be performed by threading a french sunction catheter into the tube.
