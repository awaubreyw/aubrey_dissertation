So the resultant air resistant is applied upon the boomerang on a plane shifted from the rotating axis. Then the boomerang starts rolling upon that resistive plane. Any rolling system centrifugal force to apart from the rolling plan. That perpendicular force is the &#39;reaction&#39; and boomerang undergoes an orbital motion. As a proof you can throw it out from a space craft in to the free space and observe it &#39;s motion along a sharp straight line.
