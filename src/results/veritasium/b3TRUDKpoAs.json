And these appear to be students that are of some level of achieving basic college courses.<br>There was a similar survey shown in front of Princeton University a couple decades ago and it was just as bad, as they thought it had something to do with the distance of the Earth to the Sun, which they vaguely misunderstood is varying between summer and Winter, [but the distance of the Earth is closer to the Sun in December and further in July which is the opposite of our warmer and cooler seasons in the Northern Hemisphere]. <br>I saw diagrams in my first little astronomy book when I was about 5 or 6 years of age and I understood it right from there on and ever since, when I saw the diagram showing the Earth tilted at 23 and a half degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. It shows the Earth on one side, say it Winter time with the Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the Sun and the less direct rays on the Winter Solstice date, eventually causing the colder winter weather. The diagram continues and shows the Earth on the opposite side during the first day of Summer at the June Solstice, showing the sun&#39;s rays more direct to create the warmer Summer weather. In between of course are the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, I the in milder in-between weather conditions. It&#39;s really that simple, but when you ask students to describe it they are suddenly confused.<br>This is but one small aspect of why most people still today in the modern world flunk basic science exams. It was demonstrated in the last interview that Charlie Rose conducted with Carl Sagan. You can look this up and watch it, from May 1996, as Rose reads the beginning of the introduction of Carl Sagan, from a New York Times article, titled -  Americans Flunk Science - Over Half of American Adults Are not aware that the Earth orbits the Sun once a year.<br>What&#39;s further mistaken in the misperception by many is that this 23 and a half degree tilt wobbles back and forth as the Earth rotates around the Sun, say, from Summer on one side of the Sun, to Winter, halfway around to the other side of the Sun.<br>It doesn&#39;t wobble at all, [except over perhaps 50,000 years as to what is known as precession a very slow movement like a top spinning that slows down and begins to waver back and forth on its axis, that the axis of the earth will soon one day point to Vega as the North Star,] so the yearly axis pointing toward Polaris remains perfectly relative to that tilt 365 and 1/4 days a year. <br>It&#39;s the fact of the relative point along the Earth&#39;s orbit as to what varies the tilt from one side of the Sun to the other. <br>The risk of a long explanation here but to simplify it, just hold your hand up at an angle and draw a circle out in front of you from side to side, keeping the angle the same as you move it - this is what the Earth is doing, and you can also draw smaller circles with your hand while it&#39;s at the 23 1/2 degree angle, and this will represent to understand the relative distance of the sun&#39;s rays being much less upon us in the northern hemisphere at the extreme of the first day of Winter, the Winter Solstice, on approximately December 21st every year.<br>Then move your hand to the other side of the imaginary circle you motion around the Sun, [in the middle] keeping the tilt of your hand at the same angle and realize when the earth comes around to daytime facing the Sun those rays are much shorter and direct at the summer solstice on approximately June 21st.<br>It&#39;s very basic and simple physics but common intuition tells the average person otherwise thus they develop their common misperceptions.<br><br>*It took me awhile to get to the end of the video because while I was writing, I was voice texting, and this stops the video when you voice text.
