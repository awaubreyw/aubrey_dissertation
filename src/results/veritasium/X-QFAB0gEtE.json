It seems that the potential energy of the chain is converted to kinetic energy of the weight (where else would the extra energy come from?).

So, it would follow that the chain with no weight would fall even faster than the chain with the weight at the end.  If that is correct, then increasing the mass of the weight at the end of the chain makes then end of the chain (and the weight) fall slower, but increasing the mass of the chain makes the end of the chain fall faster.  That&#39;s worth another test.

Let&#39;s talk about one such link.<br><br>This link has kinetic energy which has to go somewhere. The link is suddenly stopped by the chain above. Steel chain is pretty rigid so not a lot of energy is going to be lost to elastic stretching or compression of the steel.<br><br>Some of the energy of the link will be lost to the friction forces of the link with the link below it (we will assume as a first approximation the link above is still free fall).<br><br>But there is still more energy to be had. This is where the rotation occurs. The link above and the link below are not aligned (not co-linear) inside the gravity field. So the link we are examining has a strong torque during arrest which applies down force to the link below it (remember this link is still in free fall and may be above and to the side positionally, but in terms of the order of links in the chain is &quot;below&quot;). The counter force for this is the link holding our link in question in place &quot;above&quot;.<br><br>This effect applies link after link after link and is responsible for the snap of a whip or chain and explains the effect shown in the video here.<br><br>The entire effect only works because the chain is not aligned linearly inside the gravitational field.
