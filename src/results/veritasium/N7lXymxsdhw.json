will not say that Christianity is the best religion there&#39;s a lot of ignorant people who just go to church and say that they&#39;re Christian and it has a very violent background a lot of these evil peoplewho are in these occults and secret societies  don&#39;t even realize that they&#39;re not definitely going to hell God or the Messiah made it clear in the Book of Revelations that if they repent then he will spare them that means that they would have one more likely chance of going to heaven installed is not who you think he is he is the god of basically half for the religions on Earth even the ones you would think are bad at 1st and anti-god Solomon ran across a witch who conjured up the ghost of Samuel he said your children will die in battle the next day so they did but received the victory Solomon prayed to God for wisdom but got no answers so he did the obvious thing he consulted the witch perhaps bits and pieces of witchcraft and all of these other religions that you would think or evil to be in church or not completely all evil just some of it mixed in the scientific parts or not evil but going to evil is evil for they seek and wish evil things there have always been

Now the problem is the 1st brother will observe the 2nd brother to moving a velocity of (90c/100)+(90c/100)=180c/100.

Once you&#39;re convinced, become a Muslim. Worship the only one God who doesn&#39;t have a parent nor son, doesn&#39;t have a partner nor equal. He is the creator, the all merciful all gracious, the almighty the all hearing all seeing, the all knowing all wise. He controls everything. He is Allah.<br><br>Practice Islam according to the teachings of Quran and authentic Hadith. Quran is the last book that has Allah&#39;s words after the previous ones were changed such as Torah and Gospel. Not even a single verse in Quran was ever changed since 1400 years ago. Hadith is a collection of Prophet Muhammad&#39;s sayings, actions, approvals... etc. <br><br>following Muhammad means that you&#39;re following Jesus, Moses, Jacob, Ibrahim, Noah all the way to Adam may peace and blessings be upon all of them. All prophets came with the same message and belief, Islam. They all were Muslims. <br><br>Everything is being recorded, everything you say do... etc at every second and part of a second. Every good deed you do for the sake of Allah such as praying, helping others... gives you Hasanat in your records and it&#39;s multiplied by ten or 700 or more by Allah&#39;s mercy. And every bad deed gives Sayi&#39;ah. It can be erased by asking Allah forgiveness and many other good deeds. <br><br>After we all die and the of judgement day comes, we will be all asked and held accountable for how we led our lives. The Hasanat and Sayi&#39;at in our records are going to put on a scale. If sayi&#39;at are more we fall in the hell fire due to our bad deeds and corruption of our hearts and souls. The worse the person the lower the level in it. If Hasanat are more then we are granted the paradise by the mercy of Allah. The better the person the higher the level granted. The lowest level of paradise is way better than all heavens and earth. Note that all billions of light years observed by scientists until now are not even the edge of the first heaven. And the first is not even a ring in a desert compared to the second. And so on the higher the bigger. The paradise has what no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no mind has ever imagined. It&#39;s more beyond. <br><br>Some of those who fall into the hell fire will be forgiven by Allah and enter by Allah&#39;s mercy into the paradise. However whoever enters the paradise will never get out. <br><br>Sorry to make long. <br><br>And Peace Be Upon Those Who Follow The Guidance. \u201d", "comment_date": "2019-04-26T16:40:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sidharth Talia", "comment_text": "one could make iron man&#39;s nanotech armor with this. it might actually even work.
