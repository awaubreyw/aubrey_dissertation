Let&#39;s see you do this using only compression and expansion, as liquid air was originally made (in the 19th century, before helium was even known).  Hint: the first refrigeration used air as the working fluid.  Compress, dump the heat of compression into water, expand, and suck heat out of a reservoir (they used brine).  That gets you cold brine, cold enough to make ice.  Now use the cold brine as the heat sink for another stage, and cool something with a much lower freezing point -- like ethanol, methanol, or acetone.  One or two more stages and you&#39;ll be able to use the air in the system with a phase change, like the refrigerant in modern heat pumps, freezers, and air conditioners -- and the cold side will be filled with liquid air.  Distill to obtain pure nitrogen and liquefy that again, and done.  BTW, a minor variation of this (using modern refrigeration to cut the number of stages needed) is used for commercial production of both liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen, and pure compressed gases like nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide (all obtained by distilling liquefied air).", "comment_date": "2021-04-24T20:50:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arpita Banerjee", "comment_text": "Okay how to make liquid oxygen", "comment_date": "2021-04-24T12:07:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Baird", "comment_text": "Total nerds....

It used shop air, a similar filter shown here, and we could pump straight out of a second air connection to fill tires. Well, until it was decided to just use nitrogen for our air tools, too. To make the fill &quot;pure,&quot; we used a machine that pulled a vacuum in the tire to remove as much air as possible - twice - then filled back with nearly pure nitrogen. What makes nitrogen good for tire fills is that it will expand and contract less than ambient air does and (supposedly) the nitrogen molecule didn&#39;t find a way past the synthetic rubber and steel belts of the tires at the atomic level. We certainly noticed the difference because every late fall, when air temperatures got colder, we had a run of customers that used regular air with check tire pressure lights on.\r<br>\r<br>Also, as a note, if you do get a nitrogen fill but need to keep your tire pressures correct, it is ok to fill with regular air. You&#39;re just reducing the purity of the nitrogen content in your tire and nothing more. The more important part is to make sure your tire is filled to the correct pressures. Your sidewalls flex way more than you realize and that flexing gets worse with low tire pressure. If you&#39;ve ever noticed a perfect ring of a tire carcass where it&#39;s just the tread and no sidewall, it&#39;s because the sidewall failed from overstress and overheating. If you notice a brown colored ring around the sidewall, that is your last chance indicator that you&#39;re about to lose it and need to buy a new tire. If you do get the chance to replace it (because if you see that, it&#39;s done regardless), your technician or tire changer will probably have a hand full of rubber balls from inside the tire. That&#39;s the sidewall debris from wearing on the inside.", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T04:17:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajiv Pokharel", "comment_text": "&quot;Dont try this at home&quot;.

You need some check valves. First make sure you can seal the cooler onto your vacuum flask. Have a vent check-valve or pressure relief valve to keep the cryo area safe from inadvertent over pressurization. A flapper valve that you can blow open would be enough. Put a regulator on the output of your N2 tank, set to about 1 PSIg. Connect the regulator to your cooler assembly through a 1 PSI check valve. That way as the N2 condenses and lowers the pressure in the cooler assembly below ambient, the check valve is allowed to open, replacing the volume of condensed N2 with fresh gaseous N2, but the flow rate should be slow enough to keep from pulling too much heat into the cooler.<br>It may be difficult to find a regulator that can output as low as 1PSIg, so in that case, use a higher pressure check valve, and set the regulator&#39;s output to the same pressure as the check valve. That way a slight vacuum on the check valve is what is required to slightly open it.

Do a new double slit experiment in a vacuum, and the light will not show wave property.\r<br>\r<br>The first person to do a double slit experiment in a vacuum, to prove there is no light wave in the vacuum of space, can win a Nobel and change history.\r<br>\r<br>If you have the tools, you should take this unique opportunity.\r<br>\r<br>Put the slits and screen on the inside walls of a square glass container. Point a laser beam on the slits, video the light wave interference on the screen. Then vacuum seal the container, video the interference disappear and leave two bright lines on the screen as if light acts as a particle.\r<br>\r<br>In fact, light is not a wave, not a particle in the vacuum of space. A light wave is a vibrating electrostatic force carried by vibrating electrons/atoms propagating in a matter/medium.\r<br>\r<br>Crookes radiometer spins in a low vacuum, but it does not spin in a hard/high vacuum. This proves light is not photon particles that have momentum. Scientists denied to see the fact.\r<br>\r<br>    2. Measure light speed in a vacuum glass bottle to prove it is infinite.\r<br>\r<br>Use MIT 10 trillion frames per second camera to measure light speed in a vacuum glass bottle, we can prove light speed in vacuum is infinite, and there is no light propagating in the vacuum of space at light speed", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T21:44:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SteelWoolSheep", "comment_text": "Alan definetly has a gambling addiction", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T21:44:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "uhlus", "comment_text": "Video starts at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXkaQa53QQ&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a> <br><br>Video ends at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXkaQa53QQ&amp;t=11m58s\">11:58</a>", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T21:42:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kebman", "comment_text": "How about that.

If there really was such a convection effect, the bubbles would be rising on the warmer outside of the glass, rather than the cooler center.

I do not think there is any convection going on here at all. <br><br>What you&#39;re seeing coming down on the sides of the glass are not bubbles, rather you&#39;re seeing sheets of coffee forming and sinking.

When you hold your breath, the burning sensation and discomfort you feel is not lack of oxygen, it&#39;s build up of carbon dioxide, which is kind of poison. If you were to walk into something, like a massive rocket fuel tank in order to inspect it, and it was filled with something like argon, to prevent fires, you would happily breath it in, none the wiser, and then pass out in seconds with no warning.

The BUBBLES are rising, but they are very dense and very small, so the waves that are descending are mostly the liquid, sort of washing downward around the essentially clumps of bubbles. Look closely - the lighter colored bubbles are not descending, it is the darker colored liquid which is descending in waves. Really neat! BTW - the typical gas that beer is served on (as well as coffee) is NOT pure Nitrogen, it is called &quot;Beer Gas&quot; or &quot;Beer Mix&quot; and is 75% N2 and 25% CO2. With beer (like Guinness) - it is carbonated as normal, on CO2 (since N2 is VERY not soluble) and then SERVED on Beer Gas using what&#39;s called a sparkler plate (small plate with tiny holes) which mixes the liquid up with all of the nitrogen and CO2 in solution and stirs it. That agitation releases most of what&#39;s in solution and gives even more of that cascading effect. It also is a bit of a flow control since you have to serve Beer Gas at 30psi instead of around 12psi for normal CO2. Do that on a regular tap and you have a JET. . . from experience. . . LOL.

So basically I&#39;m wondering if using magnetic filtration could somehow be used to turn a cyro-cooler system into a Liquid Nitrogen &amp; Liquid Oxygen harvesting system instead of just a liquid Nitrogen system.<br><br><br>i really hope you see this.
