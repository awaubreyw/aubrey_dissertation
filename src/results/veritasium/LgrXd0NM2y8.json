But that&#39;s not all, there&#39;s the mental thinking as well. Consider 1 gallon = 3.70 liters and if your car goes 25 miles per gallon that&#39;s 6.76 miles per liter, then to convert that to kilometers per liter you go 10.81 Km/l. Now change your cars fuel economy to 30mpg and you go an extra 5 miles per gallon, but you only increase it by a factor of just under 2 km/L and that car now runs at 12.7Km/l. While one increased by 5 the other only increased by just under 2. Mentally you would think well there&#39;s no great difference then to go with a car with only 2 extra Km/l fuel economy, but you would mentally think that the increase by 5 means you are saving much much more. Now let&#39;s increase that fuel economy by 10 mpg and the car now gets 35 mpg while the other still gets 25mpg in Km/L those would be 14.78 Km/l and 10.81Km/l so you again think well, you only gained less than 4 Km/l while the other you see an increase of 10mpg. In a world where we want people to consider their carbon footprint, you would think you are doing a much better job when you have improve fuel economy of 10mpg then you would if you gained less than 4Km/l. So, if your fuel economy is only different by a factor of 4 why not just go with the more sporty less fuel economy car for speed?

It was essentially developed by the French.<br>2. The French were annoyed by the British system of units that made no sense to them (and many others).<br>3. The British units (yard, foot, inch, pound, ounce, gallon, quart, pint etc.) were objected to on the basis of some of them were derived from some British king&#39;s decisions and other seemingly arbitrary choices. But, most were officially defined from traditional units (which people had worked out through hands-on usage) based on merchants&#39; and buyers&#39; pleas to their British monarch to make royal pronouncements on the definitions of the various measures used in buying, pricing and selling. In other words, to set legally enforceable standards of units of measurement.<br>4. It made more sense to the French that the units of measurement should be based on something associated with the planet Earth (Gaia worship?). Never mind that this led to orphan units of measurement that practically no one uses because there are not human-factored uses for them like there is for inch and foot for instance. E.g. dekameter and decimeter.<br>5. The French also thought that various units should be multiples of 10 where appropriate, so as to obtain easily relatable larger and smaller units. E.g. a housewife would not need to deal with tonne units of butter whereas an exporter might.<br>6. To determine the metric unit of length, it was decided to perform an on-foot survey of a portion of the globe. A land survey from Barcelona, Spain to Dunkirk in northern France was conducted by a crew led by Jean Delambre and Pierre Mechain. It took six years, partially due to wars etc. and at least one life was lost. Crossing mountains can be dangerous. The idea was to determine the distance of a meridional quadrant of the Earth, the one passing through Paris, and take one ten-millionth part of that to be the definition of the new metre of linear measurement. Assumption were: the Earth is a perfect sphere, the North Star perfectly defines the location of the North Pole, and any number of others. (I&#39;m not entirely sure of the North Star one; maybe they knew how to compensate for the offset.)<br>7. So, the metre turned out to be somewhere around 39.4 inches, or a little bit longer than a British yard. They could have had the yard for nothing and it was practically the same. Definition of insanity anyone?<br>8. Years passed and merchants were entering France still using their own &quot;inferior&quot; units. So, laws were passed to make use of the metric system mandatory in France. Where have I heard of mandates being imposed? hmmmmm<br>9. &quot;Interest&quot; picked up on the metric system after that. But, the fact is that it had to be imposed by the government of France, and a considerable propaganda campaign has been conducted to fixate the mind of the people on the supposed superiority of the metric system.<br>10. No WWII allied countries rejected the &quot;standard American measurement&quot; weapons and equipment offered by the U.S. Inch bullets work just as well as millimeter ones. Same with American aircraft like the Boeing 737.

For one thing F has nearly 3 degrees for every 2 of Celsius&#39;s which gives more detail and feeling between each number. I find the degrees C a rather coarse measure. Of course, if you never used F in daily life like I have, it&#39;s nearly impossible to get used to 78\u00baF being a nice comfy temp, 88\u00baF is warm but not hot. But if you add 10\u00ba to cool 20\u00baC you get 30\u00baC, decidedly hot!! There is much more information in each F number than Cs.<br><br>Living in Europe now, I use a rule of thumb to figure out the temp in F: Multiply the number of times 5 goes into the C temp by 10 and add 30. Example: 20\u00baC is 4x5, so add 40 to 30 and the temp is 70!! The actual temp is 68\u00baF but it&#39;s close enough. For 25\u00baC I double the 5, adding 10 making it 80\u00baF which is off by 2\u00baF or 1\u00baC!! 30\u00baC is 6x5 so 60+30=90, actually 86\u00baF but again it gives a good enough approximation.... and is my way of coping with this problem.

Here are the ways in which the Fahrenheit system is superior. The actual degree of a Fahrenheit is smaller, therefore more accurate. Celsius also has a smaller range of values in which humans interact with on Earth. Depending on where one lives, it may only be about 60 degrees between the minimum and maximum, so in a way, Fahrenheit is like being a painter with more colors at their disposal in which to describe the world. You can also say things like &quot;it will be in the low 70s today&quot; which you can&#39;t do with celsius because &quot;the low 20s&quot; is too wide of a range of temperatures to be useful. When it comes to doing science, yes, Celsius is better. But just for everyday use and talking about the weather, I genuinely believe the Fahrenheit system to be superior. For those of us in the Western world, we often interact with temperatures ranging from -20F to 130F (min-max) or for me in the Midwest, typically closer to 0F-100F. Unless one is in a field of work where they are boiling water all the time, 100 degrees being the &quot;maximum temperature that I might feel in a summer&quot; is far more useful than 100 degrees being the temperature at which water boils. So what if 212 degrees seems arbitrary? How often does one actually interact with this boiling point? Not very often. We throw the kettle on and go about our day, so who cares if that number is 212 or 100? I&#39;m an American who lived in Canada for 4 years and I have to say that after interacting with both Fahrenheit and Celsius, I absolutely preferred Fahrenheit because it seems more tuned to everyday life.<br><br>As a Canadian, you interact with Fahrenheit all the time. Your temperature at the hospital is typically taken in F. When you use a stove, it is in F. Canada uses a hybrid mix-mash of systems much like the United States. I think that being familiar with both systems is the way to go. When it comes to metric vs English systems as a whole. Who cares about Km vs Miles? Or Kg vs Lbs?

Fahrenheit&#39;s scale provides a more human experience of temperature - especially when considering weather and it&#39;s swinging temperature. For Celsius, this is hard to do as it is designed for scientific rigor and best made for computers as a result.<br>Celsius says freezing water happens at 0 and boiling it at 100, makes perfect sense. It measures how temperature messes with water, a good thing to point out. However, what&#39;s a good temperature to go out in the park for a stroll? Somewhere in the teens of the scale? Possibly in the twenties? Celsius is good for science, but the human experience of temperature is a bit more subjective.<br>What good temperature to go outside in with Fahrenheit? Well, while the experience of the individual might differ, it&#39;s likely in the range of 60-80 - with a tendency to cap it closer to the high 70s then stray into the 80s. is it below 60? You might want to dress a bit warmer. Meanwhile is the scale starts straying into the 90s or breaks 100 you know that it&#39;s likely to be uncomfortable. It makes sense for human intuition. <br> It&#39;s almost like a percentage scale in its application - you&#39;re 60% sure you can go out today or 100% sure you rather not. It&#39;s not great when talking about computers or science as you quickly find numbers that really lose meaning when Celsius can tell you with absolute confidence the relative positions of the temperature in accordance with common phenomena - relating everything to how water acts. Fahrenheit, however, is good for telling the weather.<br>In short, Celsius is the scale for science and computers, while Fahrenheit is the scale for humans who want to know whether they need a jacket or just a tshirt.<br><br>This argument, as I said, has a source I can&#39;t recall, so it could just be from someone stateside who already likes Fahrenheit which may make its points a little less salient, but either way. I like Celsius for some applications myself, but in general I really just prefer Fahrenheit for its easy readability - especially for weather.

The environment commonly reaches both 0\u00b0F and 100\u00b0F and intuitively correspond to very cold and very hot, but well within the scope of human experience.

I thought Fahrenheit multiplied R\u00f8mer&#39;s numbers by 4 to come up with 0, 30, 90, and 240.  He later found 90 to be too low for human body temperature at some point so he increased it to 96.  Then later, to make it easier to create 1\u00b0 markings, Fahrenheit used 64\u00b0 difference between water freezing (increased to 32) and average human body temperature (96).  Like you said, this may be related to mercury increasing it&#39;s volume by 1 part in 10,000 with each degree increase with Fahrenheit.  The 240 doesn&#39;t make sense to me as I am not sure what R\u00f8mer used in his thermometer when he created his temperature scale.  If it was some form of alcohol, it would boil before water does.  60*4=240 doesn&#39;t make sense as we all know water boils (at standard sea level air pressure) at 212 \u00b0F.  I do know after Fahrenheit died in 1736 that the definition of water freezing was set to be exactly 32 \u00b0F and water boiling was set to be exactly 212 \u00b0F which made the average human body temperature change from 96 \u00b0F to 98.6 \u00b0F.  I also know Fahrenheit invented the mercury-filled thermometer in 1714 so he is owed thanks by Celsius and Christin who probably used mercury thermometers when they created their temperature scales.", "comment_date": "2020-11-18T06:42:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laith Means Lion", "comment_text": "Polymatter would disagree with you", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T21:32:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wojciech Bednarz", "comment_text": "No", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T03:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pwnDonkey", "comment_text": "fahrenheits waaaaay bettsr for daily life. theres a difference between 90 91 92 degrees. what is that 24.3 24.7 25 C?  celcius is stoopid.", "comment_date": "2020-11-11T10:35:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon", "comment_text": "I thought you were going to say it&#39;s time we use the global scale of Kelvin", "comment_date": "2020-11-11T08:24:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ViliamF", "comment_text": "Woah, so nobody will talk about the scary animation of him having 4 eyes when looking forward, and 2 when looking to side?!", "comment_date": "2020-11-09T12:15:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K.

It&#39;s all about human life and comfort zones. Celsius is extremely clunky, non-intuitive and pointless for daily life. There are no nice, round numbers for comfort zones; and you have to memorize a bunch of random numbers to have any idea what a given Celsius temperature range means for what you need to wear or have available for the coming day. On the other hand, Fahrenheit is extremely handy and intuitive as far as temperature ranges go. 70\u00b0 (*NOT* body temperature) is &quot;perfect room temperature&quot;, and every 10 degrees away from that is a consistent and intuitive amount less comfortable from that.<br><br>Another issue is the &quot;size&quot; of a degree. A Celsius degree is 1.8 Fahrenheight degrees, and again it doesn&#39;t sync up with humans. One Fahrenheight degree turns out to be exactly the correct increment to allow adjusting the temperature to a point that is comfortable for specific individuals, regardless of what they are doing. Celsius, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t work for that. Adjusting the thermostat by one Celsius degree is enough to go from slightly too warm to slightly too cool or vice versa. That&#39;s exactly why many thermostats go in increments of 0.5 Celsius degrees rather than 1.0 Celsius degrees. But again, because 1.0C=1.8F instead of 2.0F and 0.5C=0.9F instead of 1.0F, the discrepancy quickly adds up and goes out of sync with what a human feels.<br><br>Nobody cares what is the freezing or boiling point of water, because both are far outside the comfort range, and one of those is utterly lethal in short order. Even the freezing point is lethal without the proper clothes.

In any part of the world that has four normal seasons (i.e. not the Bahama&#39;s eternal summer or north Russia&#39;s eternal winter) you will generally experience 0-10 degree weather in winter and 90-100 degree weather in summer. Any negative temperature below 0 (-18c) or triple-digit temperature above 100 (38c) is the extreme and will be dangerous without proper preventative measures. <br><br>Another much less significant advantage to F is that it is more than twice as fine as C, so the average person only ever needs to worry about whole number temperatures. European celcius thermostats almost always display and are set by half degrees (i.e. room temperature might be 21.5) whereas American fahrenheit thermostats never do (room temperature may be 70 or 71 but never 70.5). <br><br>Meanwhile literally the only argument I have ever heard ANYONE provide in support of celcius is that water freezes and boils at 0 and 100 degrees, which to me seems completely arbitrary and unimportant. Being big, pretty, clean numbers like how the metric is all based on multiples of 10 has absolutely no significance here because no one uses &quot;kilodegrees&quot; or &quot;centidegrees&quot; and (as far as I know) there is no conversion that is made prettier simply because of those set points.<br><br>Can you honestly think of any reason water boiling/freezing at 0 and 100 would ever matter? I mean, when do those numbers ever actually come up in your life? Nobody is measuring the temperature of their water and refusing to boil their pasta or brew their tea with 99c degree water... and icecubes are always at LEAST several degrees below 0c because ice/water that was exactly 0c would be trying to melt and freeze at the same time.<br><br>If there is any reason to use celcius which is actually useful on a day-to-day basis for the average human, I would genuinely like to know.

more logical than Celsius. When it\u2019s hot, the temperature should be at a high number, like \u201c78 or 100\u201d. But instead, for Celsius it\u2019s a low number, like \u201c30\u201d. Fahrenheit is for the human body. Celsius is for water. I don\u2019t think that we as a country should really switch to metric. America doesn\u2019t have any problems with imperial units. If it\u2019s not broken, then don\u2019t fix it. Americans have made many scientific accomplishments by using both metric and imperial units. Even if we wanted to switch, do you know how much money it would take. It would cost more money than Trump\u2019s Wall. Truman made an effort to switch, but it proved to costly. Why would we waste time and billions of dollars, just to switch to some system when our own isn\u2019t really broken? Americans are just fine with Imperialist <b>and</b> metric units. The main reason why people argue for metric is because you can \u201cconvert\u201d easily. That\u2019s just short for: I\u2019m too lazy to do the math. Imperialist units do help in things like Quantum mechanics, where 1 Planck length equals 6.3*10^-34 inches, similar to planks constant. Imperial is just as useful as metric. Why not just take that extra second to do the math? This debate is really meaningless, we shouldn\u2019t be arguing about some units. So, too all of you who hate Imperial units, just stop being annoying. If you don\u2019t live in America, then it shouldn\u2019t concern you. We are doing just as successful in science as other countries, or arguably even more.

The Fahrenheit scale has 180 degrees, from 32 to 212.  Apparently, the 180 degrees appealed to Fahrenheit as being the degrees in a semi circle.  As an aside, I now live in Italy and converting F to C or C to F is a real pain but being American I have to understand the temperature in F.  The known formulae are to difficult to do in ones head so I came up with my own understanding of converting C to F.  C has a scale of 100, i.e., 0 for freezing and 100 for boiling water.  Thus, if the C temp is 20 that represents 20% of the scale.  So, to convert to F all one has to do is calculate 20% of F or 180 to arrive at 36 and then, of course, add 32 (the value of freezing in F) to get a F temp of 68.

Fahrenheit has an up because it makes sense that 0 is VERY COLD and 100 is VERY HOT and even though I&#39;m not American, I can still convert the temperatures. And also, it is more precise. Also, the downward is that Fahrenheit is only used in about six or seven countries. And Kelvin is a good scale to use it for Science, but the down is that some people still don&#39;t understand it.

It&#39;s far easier to understand. It&#39;s easy to tell how hot or cold 32 degrees is, or say 100 degrees fahrenheit. But when you try to use Celsius, it throws out the ability of how to correlate exactly how hot or cold something is. If I hear 20 degrees celsius, then how hot or cold is it? I always have to convert it to Ferinheight just to be able to know how hot or cold it is. <br><br>And why would the world&#39;s 3rd most populated country on Earth convert to Metric for day to day life now in 2017 after hundreds of years? That makes no sense. <br>We built the biggest economy in the world using it in our day to day lives. Its Europe maybe who should switch over. LOL!<br><br>Why would we switch over, when Europe still uses the inferior method of say just RON to measure the octane of Gas. The (R+M/2) method in the US is far superior as it better represents real world burn. Just saying it goes both ways in ways countries measure things. <br><br>The US can&#39;t really convert to Metric anyway as many folks don&#39;t understand the metric system at all. They never once even taught it at my school for example. So there&#39;s thousands of kids alone who never learned it. I believe the only class that actually touched on the subject of metric, was Chemistry class. And you only learned a quick 6 weeks course on it, if you just happen to have taken that subject. So you learned 6 weeks of Metric vs a lifetime of Imperial.

Every cookbook in US history has used Imperial. So every cookbook in history would only need to be re-written. So you&#39;re talking about a massive waste of money and resources. The US was built from the ground up on Imperial. And all efforts to have the US convert have failed. Only in dealing with international trade is metric even used. However almost all domestic trade between the states are using imperial. No one in general society uses metric. We run our personal daily lives in Imperial.

There have been numerous federal declarations that we are all now &quot;metric&quot; ever since the 1970&#39;s. (Heck, I used to use a ruler in centimeters in 1975.) And to be honest, most people in the U.S are bilingual on this subject anyway. We can talk in either system, and it honestly doesn&#39;t matter so long as you can COMMUNICATE with whoever you&#39;re talking to. <br><br>But then you run into the largest obstacle with simply &quot;passing a law&quot; intended to change the way 320 million behave in their everyday lives. Older people were born and raised using a particular set of numbers. They think in those numbers, and have to translate to the others. You CANNOT simply pass a law and then tell these people to &quot;use these other numbers now&quot;. <br><br>We are currently watching, in the U.S., what it actually takes to change how so many people speak of something that was simply a part of the world they grew up in. We&#39;re watching the exact same thing in attitudes regarding gay marriage, civil rights for Black people, use of cannabis, and a thousand other issues that people would have had FIRM opinions about 40 years ago. <br><br>What we are watching right now is people dying. The same thing people have watched for the entirety of human history. The POINT behind this is that younger people have different ideas from their parents and grandparents. As older people leave us, the younger people change the way the world works, and they usually do not change it in predicted ways. <br><br>Anyway, as I was saying... the U.S. ALREADY uses all the international metric systems that all the other countries use as well. Officially, that is. If you ask the federal overlords, they will tell you that we are already as &quot;international&quot; as anyone else. And in a certain sense, they are RIGHT. <br><br>But what you see at the corner hardware store, when an older fellow needs to get some nuts and bolts, is the same numbers that he is familiar with and has used for the last 50 years. Right alongside him is a younger fellow who is buying a handful of Metric nuts and bolts to use on his Honda. In today&#39;s world, in the U.S., these people are about 50/50. <br><br>But I can tell you right now... 30 years from now, it will be very common to have all metric sizes of nuts and bolts at the hardware store - and the older types of nuts and bolts are going to be off to the side, because they will be much less common than the &quot;normal&quot; hardware people buy every day. <br><br>THAT is how the world changes, young man. I know it&#39;s very easy to say in your video that &quot;the U.S. should just change what they do&quot;, but you don&#39;t seem to realize that you&#39;re putting 20 volumes of human history into one simple-sounding sentence - and you&#39;re ignoring the fact that it&#39;s something we&#39;re already in the process of doing. <br><br>You&#39;re young, younger than I am. You WILL see this process come full circle, even though I likely won&#39;t. The only thing you show to people when you say something like this is a lack of patience and a lack of understanding for human nature - neither of which you should be ignoring when talking about the lives of this many people, and when telling them they &quot;should change&quot; a part of their lives that has remained the same for 50 years or more. <br><br>They aren&#39;t going to do that, but their children will.

I am sick of these videos that try to portray the United States as morons because we still use the English system.  So what if we do.  SI units are more accurate, it was adopted because it was decimal based.  Its just as arbitrary to call the freezing point of water at 1 atm (101,325 Pa) 0 degrees and the boiling point of water at 1 atm (101,325 Pa) in SI units  as  32 degrees and 212 degrees respectively in English units.  In research the whole world uses the SI units but if I am filling up my car with gasoline and put 5 gallons in my tank does that mean I can&#39;t tie my shoes or function in the world.  Does that mean I can&#39;t do the math to convert to SI units?  It really comes down to what you are used to.  If someone says it is 50 degrees Celsius I don&#39;t have a quick instinctual judgement on really how hot that is, I have to convert that to Fahrenheit then i know.  Or if say to someone that it was 40 degrees and I wore a coat, they would look at me funny until I told them that is Fahrenheit and then if I converted it to Celsius then they would know I would have needed a coat on that day.    SI units were adopted because of how powerfully it related mass to volume to energy.  And it just easy to go from milliliter to liter just by moving the decimal point .

If I were to have complete control over what system of deciding temperature we use, I would choose Fahrenheit! Hear me out! The 0 to 100 temperature scale works very well due to its familiarity in other things. This is the first advantage of Fahrenheit. Often when rating things we will put it from a scale of 1 to 10 in this case it would encompass Temperature on a human scale with each individual temperature in between acting as the decimal in between the temperature bases. <br>(and below) <del>10F</del> ARCTIC   0- FRIGID   10F- Very Cold   20F- Cold   30F- Freezing   40F- Chilly   50F- Cool   60F- Mild   70F- Comfortable   80F- Warm   90F- Hot   100F- Very Hot and for hotter climates... 110F- BLAZING. (and above)<br>Overall I would say this range of temperatures is pretty accurate to the human experience with the two extreme outliers as one being -1 out of 10 and the other being 11 out of 10. The 1 to 10 OR 1 to 100 scale is subjective but is popularized across the planet thus making it valid as a point. <br>                      The second less debatable advantage is the fact that the Fahrenheit system is great at more specific descriptions of the temperature outside or inside which by difference in temperature is about the smallest change we can notice as humans being a change in a Fahrenheit degree quite conveniently. You see 21C is room temperature for most of the planet but in the United States there is debate over whether 69F is room temperature or 70F is room temperature. Why you may ask? It is simply because there is a minor difference in the overall feel of a room which would simply be generalized by Celsius that is in fact noticeable to humans.<br>                      Celsius is mean&#39;t to correlate to water in liquid form on the 1 to 100 scale by using the same unitary distance as Kelvin while for overall purposes is superior in every category except, day to day life where Celsius has an advantage over Kelvin, however Fahrenheit takes center stage in terms of a human standpoint leaving Celsius to it&#39;s true purpose and that is the temperature of water. just as Fahrenheit is to be loosely relatable to human comfort. Celsius in my opinion really shines as a jack of all trades master of none kind of temperature scale. which can be applied in many ways.<br>                     Finally the third part of the superiority of Fahrenheit in normal day to day practice is based in meteorology an actual science which favors Fahrenheit for its smaller distances between whole numbers of temperature on its scale and because weather on earth typically stays within a rough range of 150 Fahrenheit for most areas of the Earth.<br>                     Though I am biased to the scale I do believe through simple cold hard facts that Fahrenheit does have a place in the grand scheme of things. If I were to redo the scale however i would likely adjust the system 10 or 12 Fahrenheit units warmer. In other words 10F would be the new 0F and 110F would be the new 100F and not to mention the freezing point would be 22F which should be memorable enough.

Are you sure that you are not saying that just because you are used to the system, but because the Imperial units truly are good for daily use? Tell me, then, what exactly makes the Imperial system better for daily life? Anyone can spit out at least one reason why the metric system is easier (prefixes of course lol), but what is GOOD about the imperial system, besides the fact that it makes our &#39;Murica special? Huh?<br>And what&#39;s even funnier is that when people try to explain why SI units work so well in science, there&#39;s always a couple of replies saying &quot;Who cares&quot;. Okay.

But you don&#39;t do that with temperature, there is no special name for 1000 degrees Celsius like there is for 1000 meters. The only difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit is the size of their units and where they put zero. The zero value is totally arbitrary, the only place that is &quot;better&quot; than any other is absolute zero which is why the Kelvin and Rankine scales exist. And the size of the units is also inconsequential, as long is it is a standardized amount the exact value means nothing. For example a yard and a meter are almost exactly the same length but the usefulness of the metric scale is higher than that of the imperial scale, the unit size doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s how the units are grouped together (again, something we don&#39;t do with temperature).", "comment_date": "2016-11-28T16:57:28Z", "likes_count": 44}, {"comment_by": "Manoj N", "comment_text": "this is what I have been wondering...<br><br><br>...why can&#39;t we all use the same temperature scale globally? my suggestion is that we should neither use \u2103 or \u2109 but Kelvin as Kelvin is the S.I. unit of temperature. but then we have to make some changes in the way we think like, boiling point of water will not be 100K (K is the representation of Kelvin) but it will be 373 or more precisely, 373.15 K since 1\u2103 is 273.15K.", "comment_date": "2016-11-28T16:56:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DirtyWhiteBoy", "comment_text": "212 degrees Fahrenheit vs 100 degrees Celsius<br>Which one is more accurate?<br><br><br>The answer is...........

It makes more sense to put a thermometer into a bucket of water and let it freeze to determine what zero is, seeing as buckets would have been a common household tool before indoor plumbing.  I decided to start learning how to convert F to C last summer.  I begin with 10c = 50F.  Every 5 C = 9 F.  So if 10=50, then if I want to know what 15c is, I add 9 to 50, arriving at 59.  Then for 20, I would add 9 to that, so that 20 = 68, and so on.  And so it works in reverse.  Starting at 10=50, 5c = 50-9, or 41 and 0c = 50 - 18 or 41 - 9 or 32 F.<br><br>Of course, for the middle numbers, such as 21, 22, 23, 24, each degree c = 0.9 F.  Rounding up or down to the nearest whole, remember the numbers 2, 2, 3, 2, 2.  So 20 = 68, 21 = 70 (plus 2), 22 = 72 (plus 2),  23 = 73 (plus 1), 24 = 75 (plus 2), and 25 = 77 (plus 2), which of course works with the basic formula of 25 = 9 X 3 (27) plus 50.  Once I was able to readily convert, the F scale no longer makes sense to me.  Why wouldn&#39;t water freeze at zero?<br><br>By the way, I think it interesting that -40c = -40F.

Due to the fact that it&#39;s more precise (a 10 degree interval in Celsius equates to an almost 20 degree interval in Fahrenheit), the range of temperatures that occur naturally in temperate regions covers the entire 0-100 of the Fahrenheit scale. You can also describe the temperature in terms of &quot;in the 40s,&quot; &quot;in the upper 70s,&quot; &quot;low 50s,&quot; etc. And although this is purely coincidental, 0 and 100 act as sorts of endpoints of the scale when used in weather reporting. In many parts of the United States, 0 Fahrenheit is a very low temperature for a winter day, and likewise 100 is a very high temperature for a summer day. This depends on region of course. As an added bonus, many parts of the United States and Europe have year-round average temperatures of about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and (coincidentally of course) 50 is the midpoint of the scale. The only downside I see to using Fahrenheit in weather reporting is the fact that freezing is 32 instead of 0, but this really isn&#39;t a big deal.
