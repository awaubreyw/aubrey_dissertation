I got asked to go help with the replacement of parts of a similar machine made in the US which was to be converted to fill the same syringes they fill here Ireland. Everything was in fractions of inches. I didn&#39;t say anything, it&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve used Imperial on high tolerance parts. However, this was the first time I hadn&#39;t been requested to send any parts designed, back in Imperial, and a couple of small parts were drawn up in both Imperial and metric already. As the team I was working with were all Irish or German, we agreed to work in metric. A few weeks later, parts are written up, the requested ones made, and the remaining drawings emailed over to the US. Within a few hours, we got a call asking if what we had sent was a joke. Why wed sent everything in metric, to America. Some harsh words were sent on the phone, and some unessicery claims made. A few days later and after some more aggressive calls, and a very quick meeting to investigate for clarification from our side back home in Ireland, we were told we would need to pay up for the costs involved for sending it all in metric. To which we replied, we&#39;re sorry such a large problem had occurred, the parts had been fitted, tested, and were well within the requested tolerances. We then decided to reference the treaty of the metre and that metric was part of the ISO, and hoped the yanks wouldn&#39;t start paying for solicitor work, which would be useless, and a waist of their money. The very next day, we were told they&#39;d stopped complaining. <br>My experience with US companies in Ireland has typically been very positive outside of how they treat their employees.

You see, I&#39;m 39, now, and back in fifth grade, they taught us the metric system at the school I was going to.  That school ended up closing, soon thereafter, and I don&#39;t know why, but a few years later, I was traveling with my aunt, uncle, and two cousins, to a different state, to see another cousin get married.  We were traveling by car, and at every rest stop, someone would raise the question, &quot;Have we traveled 1000 miles, yet?&quot;<br><br>My younger cousin, after I said something about this question (I don&#39;t remember what), said, &quot;But for sure, the van has traveled more than 1000 <i>millimeters?&quot;</i><br><br>Now, it had been several years since I had given metric units for measuring distance any <i>thought,</i> but before I could give this suggestion any consideration, my <i>older</i> cousin jumped in and said, &quot;Well of <i>course</i> it has traveled more than 1000 <i>millimeters!</i>  It covered 1000 <i>millimeters</i> in the first <i>block!&quot;</i><br><br>To be fair, that&#39;s true.  It <i>had</i> covered 1000 millimeters in the first block.  But as I thought on the unit and dug up what I had learned, years earlier, the humor in the suggestion and the counter-suggestion became apparent to me.<br><br>The prefix &quot;milli&quot; in &quot;millimeter&quot; means &quot;thousandth.&quot;  1000 millimeters is 1000 thousandths of a meter or 1 meter.  A meter is just a few inches more than a yard.  So when you say, &quot;This van has covered 1000 millimeters,&quot; you are saying, &quot;This van has covered a meter,&quot; or &quot;This van has covered a yard and three inches.&quot;  The van covered 1000 millimeters, more than three times, just <i>sitting</i> there.
