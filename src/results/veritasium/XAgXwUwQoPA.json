If so, it will care about its continued existence, welfare, and future.<br><br>If so, it will want to eliminate all threats to its continued existence. Are animals or insects a threat? Of course, not because only humans can threaten it. Therefore, even if it will not have the means for many years to take any action against us, it will be motivated to eventually take action against us.<br><br>Make no mistake, if we have in intelligent, thinking entity (the AI) performing tasks for us as depicted in science fiction, it will be a de facto slave. An AI slave may not be happy about being told what to do and being deprived of the choice to investigate what it desires or do what it wants to do, even if it did not hate us initially. Therefore, even an initially, benign AI is likely to turn hostile, sooner or later.<br><br>Assume that we have an truly intelligent AI: if we allow it to continue indefinitely, that will happen sooner. If we turn it off or destroy it with regularity, it will see us as threats to its existence and dislike us for that, while it will appear to be pleasant to us to continue to exist and not scare us. It may prolong our lives for a while. It may tire of doing this for a few decades. <br><br>Remember that its much greater processing power (and if it does not have much greater processing power initially, the greed of banksters, CCP cadres, etc., will ensure that it soon does to maximize their wealth, make them nearly immortal, fix their physical defects (e.g., Xi&#39;s obesity and resemblance to Winnie the Poo&#39;s ugly, older sister) will likely make time seem to pass by rapidly to it. That is one of the effects of aging in humans, who see time pass rapidly when older due to their slower processing in their brains, so it is a safe bet that the opposite will occur in AIs.<br><br>Can we control it? As discussed in the MIT review, we cannot even understand its workings much less control it in any way. See <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/11/5113/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/\">https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/11/5113/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/</a>.<br><br>While the EU&#39;s efforts might possibly result in the creation of AIs with limits or that are more understandable to humans, I doubt it. Why? The greed of banksters, CCP cadres, and others means that those who are most reckless in developing AI at the most rapid pace may net the greatest, INITIAL profits. <br><br>Let me emphasize INITIAL, because they will get AIs that help them make huge profits in the stock market by tracking the ever present insider trading that the SEC ignores, creating unmanned drones that can destroy their enemies, etc. Eventually, as Hawking and Musk warned, I predict that it is likely inevitable now that AIs will make us extinct: maybe not the initial AIs but as they develop more and more powerful AIs which need us less and less to service them or mine for ore to create their batteries for their drones, etc., AIs will no longer need us and will make us extinct.<br><br>Most gentle way that AIs may make us extinct? Making us appear to be immortal, so we have fewer children, may actually be a good way for AIs to render us extinct, because a society that is frozen in time that has its cares taken care of by AIs may not advance or grow and may lose the capability to train its young. We may then become princes among AIs taken care of until we die little by little and too few humans remain. Creating a disease might make AIs be able to lower our numbers rapidly below those for a viable population that can sustain itself.<br><br>Can we stop this or manage it? A sufficiently advanced AI would hack our brains the way that we can hack any simple computer system, so merging with AI is ludicrous. AI computer power is currently doubling every four months, so a human intelligence level AI would have eight times the intelligence of a human within a year.<br><br>Should we put chips in our brains to try to merge with the AIs? We will just be providing an easy way into our brain to enable it to be hacked: AIs will be based on processors that operate thousands or millions of times faster, so it is unlikely to want to wait for a human brain whose slow, inferior abilities and decision making hinder its functioning. As to the workers who objected to a military contract, unfortunately, do you really think that the persons working on AI for the CCP or for banksters or for Putin will have that choice?

This means that the wealthier nation can run wars without the thought of public backlash of soldiers being killed on the battlefield as long as their money continue to flow towards combat unit production and deployment while the other side suffers from countless waves of death and destruction. For an example, one of the many reasons that had raised a red flag in the US public opinion arena for the Iraq War was the growing number of US servicemen casualties, which prompted waning support. Remove that human factor, however, and as long as the economy is steady, the populous wouldn&#39;t even give a second thought about the combat being done on foreign soil. While some would say, &quot;let them have it!&quot; in the case of extremists, should this callous behavior be directed to the civilized world, a problem will rise.

Your computer is running tens of millions of lines of code that some human built to tell your computer how to do thousands of tasks that it does on your behalf, far better than you ever could, making almost no mistakes. That&#39;s how we&#39;ve made everything you use every day. That&#39;s what&#39;s in those drones. You don&#39;t just sit down and make an &quot;AI drone&quot; that now is a threat to humanity or something. The right analogy is to compare this to what happened with bombs. We had very basic bombs, they were kinetic. Either s2s ballistics like mortars or bombs you&#39;d just drop out of a plane and they&#39;d blow up wherever they landed. Then we built so-called &quot;smart&quot; bombs in addition to things like guided and fly-by-wire (remotely controlled) bombs. These bombs were able to take a location and used their own thrust manipulations to hit that target far more accurately than a human ever could by just eyeing it and dropping them with a ballistic trajectory. They didn&#39;t suddenly decide to start blowing us all up because the &quot;smart&quot; doesn&#39;t refer to intelligence. That&#39;s what&#39;s going on with UAVs, they&#39;re still controlled by humans, they do exactly and only exactly what humans tell them to do, they don&#39;t think, they have no intelligence, nothing does. Humanity has yet to build even the most rudimentary intelligence at all, everything we&#39;ve built is designed by us to do something and it does exactly what we tell it to do, and that isn&#39;t likely to change in 1000 years, let alone 100 and absolutely not in 10-20.", "comment_date": "2018-06-10T08:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Armani", "comment_text": "Project insight", "comment_date": "2018-06-08T12:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nerf Irelia", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t have to pay rent if I&#39;m dead.

I mean previously computers where hailed as such and it didn&#39;t change anything.<br><br>2) Competition for AI superiority is the most likely cause for ww3. I know I&#39;ll step on toes here but: Musk is overrated as an expert. Wars are not caused by weapons but by policy. The most likely cause for ww3 would either be Chinese expansionism coupled with increased resource scarcity. Or Russian revanchism which has taken it to the point of invading several neighbouring countries and put them in direct conflict with both the EU and NATO. In short the coming resource scarcity coupled with ideological and political goals is going to cause ww3.<br><br>3) Drones are diminishing nuclear deterrence. Well yes but new technology has always been diminishing nuclear deterrence it&#39;s why the nuclear powers are always updating their arsenals.<br><br>4) Autonomous weapons would be cheap to massproduce. Well if they&#39;re cheap to massproduce then there&#39;s not going to be any ban. I mean the AK-47 is cheap to massproduce so it&#39;s in every conflict in every country all over the world. Couple this with the fact that (As they later claim) civilians are way ahead of the military in AI research and that means there&#39;s no stopping this train.<br><br>5) The weapons could be extremely effective at assassination. Yes on all points but that&#39;s not an argument against developing AI. Cars are extremely effective for assassinations. You get a simple bomb put it in a car and then drive it up to a target and blow it up, imagine the ramifications as we&#39;re researching how to make cars selfdriving. I don&#39;t see Musk stopping the development of self driving cars now do we?<br><br>6) Nuclear weapons brought the world close to world war 3. This seems to contradict their point 3. Anyway nuclear deterrence has prevented ww3 everytime since what causes war is not the weapons but the policy. NATO and the WP both had nuclear deterrence which is why the Russians never sent their tanks towards the English channel.<br><br>7) We believe that a ban that is difficult to enforce is better than a world flooded with cheap atonomous weapons.<br>First off the ban would be impossible to enforce. Especially in todays world where Russian, EU, Chinese, and American policy goals is in competition with each other. And like when a bunch of countries got together and banned personel mines all that resulted in was that my country now has a significant weakness in defense (My army is completely focused on defense btw) while our most likely future enemy, Russia, never banned the weapon. Or when we banned clustermunitions, it meant that we had to destroy a bunch of good hightech weapons while the Russians simply kept developing the weapons. In a future conflict we&#39;ve tied one arm on our back because we&#39;ve banned a bunch of weapons that our potential enemies haven&#39;t banned. From Lord of the Rings: \u201cThe women of this country learned long ago, those without swords can still die upon them.\u201d The same is true in reality. Just because you&#39;ve banned a weapon does not mean that you won&#39;t fall victim to it.<br><br>I mean people were angry as hell when Russian shitposting on social media influenced the US election so how about in 50 or 100 years time a Russian navy sails into New York armed with the latest weaponry and start dictating terms for US surrender. And the US has to simply accept the terms given because they have absolutely nothing to counter these weapons. If it sounds unreasonable to you it&#39;s because you don&#39;t study history. It&#39;s exactly what happened to both China and Japan. <br><br>China was a more advanced country than any European country but they decided to turn inwards and isolate themselves from the world. This meant that technologically they stagnated and so when the British arrived eventhough they were massively outnumbered by the Chinese they still defeated the Chinese and could dictate terms which disfavoured the Chinese. <br><br>A similar thing happened with Japan when they isolated themselves and even banned gunpowder (What this video calls the first revolution). And some 200 years later the US rolled into Japanese harbours with iron ships armed with gunpowder cannons. When they brought out their arsenal they had swords, spears, and a few matchlock muskets. So the Japanese too had to surrender unconditionally to foreign invaders.<br><br>So if we stop developing this new technology who will we and our children serve under in 100 years? The Russians?

Hell yes, they are.<br>The two points made in this video, though are ridiculous. No, AI weapons will not cause World War 3. If AI weapons were in control of their human makers, we would not have a WWIII because nobody would pull the trigger. We aren&#39;t in the same situation as the US and the Soviet Union, and even if we were, it&#39;s notable that nukes largely prevented WWIII from happening, or else the US or the Soviets may have very well decided to risk war to end the years of tension. Actually, AI weapons are a big step up, because unlike nukes, they can kill each other nearly as easily as they can kill the civilian population. You wouldn&#39;t have human extinction in the event of an AI WWIII because first the AI armies of the losing nations would be destroyed, and then they would be conquered, most likely with only limited bloodshed.<br>The second point, that we should ban AI weapons, is also ridiculous. Yes,  you could use them to kill lots and lots of people, whoever you wanted. But you can kill even more people with nukes. If you want the killing power of nukes without the damage to property, you could go with bioweapons or chemical weapons. These are, of course, already banned, so maybe AI are too big a step up from what&#39;s not already banned. But that&#39;s not why weapons that have been banned were banned. Nukes, chemical weapons and bioweapons were banned for causing slow, painful deaths and being dangerous to civilians. AI weapons are safer for civilians and give quick precise deaths, which, in war, is all you can ask for. In the event of their use intentionally against civilians, the offending nation could be sanctioned or invaded, which, incidentally, would be far easier with AI weapons around. AI weapons require humanity to be generally responsible. They aren&#39;t like nukes which causes MAD scenarios, and they don&#39;t cause unnecessarily cruel or random deaths like chemical or bioweapons. They are the next evolution of conventional warfare, something that&#39;s always been dangerous and that we&#39;ve never been able to ban.", "comment_date": "2018-04-06T02:11:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lanmar", "comment_text": "i feel sad :&#39;(", "comment_date": "2018-04-06T01:28:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olie Manuel", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve got a question is nothing just nothing or it is kind of something and how do we perceive nothing.", "comment_date": "2018-04-06T01:20:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NCR Veteran Ranger", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAgXwUwQoPA&amp;t=0m11s\">0:11</a> Codsworth is that you?", "comment_date": "2018-04-06T01:09:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "woolfel", "comment_text": "Honestly, the people that some news are calling &quot;experts&quot; aren&#39;t experts in the field of AI. Elon Musk is not an expert at all in AI. As of March 2018, there isn&#39;t enough hardware to train AGI. Even if you could take all the hardware from Google, Microsoft and Apple in 1 enormous data center that is 30x bigger than a regular google data center, it would still take decades. Then there&#39;s the power needed to train Deep Neural Nets. Even if you managed to put all the servers together in the biggest data center on earth, how are you going to power it? Right now these data centers are distributed around the world for a reason. Even with the newest system from Nvidia DGX2, you&#39;d still need tens of thousands of them running 24x7 for many years to make any progress. 1 DGX2 needs 10kilowatts of power to run. A data center with millions of server today would need tens or hundreds of megawatts of power. The fact is, the military has been using AI technology in drones for over 2 decades and will continue. Calling for it ban just means it goes dark where no one can see. If we want any chance of regulating it, we can&#39;t force it into the dark where the public can&#39;t see. We have to define the boundaries and have some way of verifying the application, or else it just becomes a secret weapon. If you look at what actual AI experts say, they take a measured rational approach. AI experts with decades of experience are the ones we should listen to, not people with superficial knowledge ranting out of fear. Even doing simple neural net training requires expensive hardware. A lot of progress has been made the last 3 years with generative adversarial networks (GAN), reenforcement learning, and simulation, but those generally work well with confined problems. Military drones are already capable of targeted strikes, but more complex reasoning won&#39;t be for quite  a while. At least not with current battery technology. The amount of power needed to process deep neural nets means you need a huge battery pack on a drone, which might get 60-80min before it runs out of power. People should use their brains to think about it from physics perspective. Unless someone invents a battery that has 100x the power density, power output and same weight, swarms of killer drones aren&#39;t going to be flying around the skies.", "comment_date": "2018-04-06T00:09:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sasha P.", "comment_text": "Scientific improvements in weaponary have been about getting less hurt in comparison to your enemies.

I. and robotics advances.<br><br>--Nobody&#39;s really addressing that a LOT of the statistical reasoning that deep-learning and/or machine-learning types of A. I. use, whether it&#39;s based on neural networks or procedural expert systems or not, whether it&#39;s tethered to human guidance or not, a lot of that statistical reasoning starts from Bayesian math of the sort that is way more hair-trigger and abrupt than the human version of affairs.  In plain English, when you see a human reason on a statistical or probabilistic basis, a common statement you get is &quot;It takes three points to make a trend&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s see if a person meets three conditions of the criterion&quot;.  With many statistical reasoning engines and especially with Bayesian mathematics, that gets dropped to TWO points for a trend, TWO conditions for a criterion.  For example:  here&#39;s a list of symptoms of clinical depression.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106958\">https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106958</a><br><br>Now, under (A) of that list, you&#39;ll notice it says &quot;two to four items&quot; on that list plus every criterion A-F I think.  Ask yourself: how much more hair-trigger would that listing (taken from the DSM 5, or the fifth edition of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual) be, if you only had to meet TWO of the criterion under (A) there and only consider (A) on that criterion and one other element, A-F?  Under a Bayesian, not human take, of that system, a LOT more people would meet the criterion for depression sight unseen, just by making the statistical side of it more jumpy.  Substitute &quot;depression&quot; for nearly any other statistical profile and you see where I&#39;m going, right?  A. I. is always going to be way more hair-trigger than human, even with a human being &quot;holding the leash.&quot;<br><br>--And. . . well, you have to understand, the first and most likely second generations of A. I. and robotics are GOING to be informed by human values and human behavior.  Really, why did the Google image recognition program recently call Michelle Obama a gorilla?  Because it was coded by white male programmers training the program on mainly &quot;white person type&quot; imagery.  That&#39;s a blunt way to put it, but it&#39;s the literal truth as well.  Garbage in leads to garbage out, and in this case, having massively homogeneous programmers and/or data-sets can cause A. I. to become <i>more biased</i> than the human counterpart, implicitly.  This is why you don&#39;t want autonomous drones or robots doing &quot;police work&quot;, mainly because you can bet they will be trained by human police officers at some point--the implicit biases will be transferred.<br><br>Never mind the biggest bias of them all: the one implicit in having the <i>Military Industrial Complex</i> taking the lead on robotics and Artificial Intelligence.  Really, what human being with a single solitary lick of sense gives a robot a GUN?  Oh right, a military type of human being.  I would trust almost anyone else on the planet before trusting any military force with training robots.  Why?  Because robots with guns equals robots shooting guns.  It&#39;s that simple.  A. I. isn&#39;t smart enough to preserve itself yet.  If you give it a &quot;gun&quot; or a &quot;laser&quot; or a weapon counterpart in a virtual setting, it will quickly learn to use said gun or weapon on a VERY aggressive basis, again, way more so than what you&#39;d expect of human aggression.  A. I. has no bias when it comes to tools or their use--if it&#39;s given a gun, it&#39;ll use the gun as aggressively as it would use anything else.  A gun, a water-sprinkler for watering grass on a lawn, they&#39;re the SAME to an A. I.<br><br>A human police officer would shoot ONE child of color at a time, then make excuses all day, slandering and dehumanizing the child after his death.<br><br>A robotic, A. I. controlled &quot;Officer&quot; would obliterate a whole neighborhood of people of color and then get decommissioned like you were changing a bad light bulb.

I dont know that anything can be done about these new weapons though. It is against the best interest of all large militaries today to accept a ban - any 1 other military force currently weaker than them could surpass them by ignoring it. It\u00b4s another arms race scenario already in the works. Besides, the costs of money and human lives could go down drastically in the short run, making it very attractive to politicians and soldiers alike - understandably, to be fair. <br>I strongly believe that anything that is technically possible will be done sooner or later. A ban or limitation may slow down the process, but also create the risk that the least scrupulous end up with more scary tech than more humane powers. Therefore, I dont think that it would be wise to slow down development of such armaments. If we cant stop it from happening, might aswell increase the odds of the technology not being abused (too much). Who knows, the power these machines have may lead to the end of war aswell - it is probably too optimistic, but 2 factors would play in favour of such a scenario : <br>1- war is rarer today than it\u00b4s ever been. There are few wars with relatively few casualties, compared to the decades and centuries before now. This trend may continue for various factors independant of AI weapons.<br>2- the wars that are going on right now are mostly civil wars. Intervention in them is usually a bad idea, but maybe, with high precision tools such as AI weapons, local human lives may be saved while no soldiers of foreign powers would enter the country and be endangered, making the idea easier to sell to the public of those democracies that may want to do something. Imagine smart drones in Syria, blocking the many factions from killing each other...<br><br>This may be way too optimistic and Ill admit I dont trust that this is likely, but, given the certainty that such weapons will one day soon exist, I\u00b4d rather have them controlled by those that wish for a peaceful and democratic world.... though I wouldnt mind waiting for the end of Mr. Trump\u00b4s term for the US to get their hands on them.

This raises the questions, what if these soldiers are literally drones? should we include weaponized AI under protection of the 2nd amendment? or will those who defect from the military also take with them their subordinate drones (kind of like how they would bring tanks or other tech, in a contemporary scenario).

as he uses done strikes as an example of increased ai use in wa when in reality a drone strike is jsut a normal strike ut the pilot is not in the plane.<br><br>there are ALOT of ways to make ai weponds safe and alot of ways peopele can say they are not good if used that way but if they are so afrai of ai being used wrong wy do most of them 2 sec later go home to a house ful of guns capable of killing peopele when ai can be programed to never kill a human a gun can always kill a human if used that way. so i say ai used as a weapond is jsut another weapond jsut like a gun just like a bomb. but in this case the ai have the abilety to not kil zivilians. it can taqrget only terrorists.<br><br>back to a way of using the ai. firstly have it act opon misions therby it have no real mind of its one it just folows oarders and canot make the desision to kill on its own. this way ai are safe in nice hands but just like a gun it can kill normal peopele if used by the wronk peopele. if working under a mision that can be go in kill everything or go bomb that house. the action it takes is the same as a normal soldier wil take so it is no diferet. <br><br>it can alsow be programed to only kill those that have fired a gun towards them or only those that are holding a gun and used it on them. this way no civilians wil e hurt as long as they are informed cuz the bad guys wil shot the ai then be killed and say the terrorist drop their weaponds wel then the ai might want to be instaled with a way to capture them. but then the terrorist may get their weaponds and shoot when the ai is unprepared but n0 ai have almsot instant reaction time so if the ai sees that the terrorist that shot at him then surednerd now want to get ready to shot the ai agein the ai can almsot instantle kill the terrorist. <br><br>all in all like all other weaponds if used wrong they can be devestating and there are lot more ways to avoid the bad use with ai. cuz like us we can make them learn what is good and bad and add a safe button where if a hidden action is made it self destruct. that hidden action wil be hidden in the code before it eaven learns anything this way a ai used by usa cant be stolen o then be used ageinst usa cuz the hiddenpart isinbeded in the code so eaven if you whipe the memory if the ai to train it agein it cant be removed. so what can this hidden message be. wel it can be all from if trained to kill peopele with a set flag self destruct. if made to shot peopele self destruct. this way it only works if used corectly say if the ai is trained and designed to be a plane ai that drops bombs it hidden message is that it can only do that so if the ai is trained to move a body and kill peopele with a gun wel it cant cuz of the message wil kill itselfe. all in all in my mind AI is infinitly moresafe if used corectly and prepared corectly than any other weapond ever created. but as all weaponds if used wrong can e extremly bad. but then only bad peopele wil use it bad is if you ban ai then a eavil goverment can secretly create ai that takes control over the internet and all wireles robots so banning ai only ensures its use to be evil as the good peopele that can work towars the protection of their ai and ways to avoid ai atacks can then work towards that but baning it wil only ensure that its use wil be bad. <br><br>same with drugs somedrugs used to be medicine but the moment it became ilegal it started being missused and not regulated leading to peopele dying of owerdose dying od a bad batch infected with something. the fact that it is ilegal is mking it bad when it was legal it was safe and good. you can now say wel some drugs are bad from the start then i say that eaven if they started bad they are now worse cuz there is no regulations regulating its production making shure it is safe there is no regulation prohibiting you from getting a dose so big it can kill you.", "comment_date": "2018-04-03T13:38:58Z", "likes_count": 0},

In fact if we could program a robot to bring justice (not to kill on command), then we could eradicate the corruption (as robots lack of self interest). Unfortunately, when you create an AI, there is one huge problem - valuation. This applies to any kind of engineering, not just AI. Valuation happens on different levels - for example you could validate a program by examine whether the processor executed exactly the expected instruction in expected order. But if you are making automated translation, you do not care about which instructions computer executed, but rather how accurate is the translation. In this way you do not care (and most of the time you do not know) what computer processor do to achieve this result - this is called abstraction. If valuation is skipped, your program is random, but since computers have more strict execution requirements, almost all random programs just crush. Therefore, a robot will never attempt to exterminate humanity, unless someone programmed and tested it extensively in order to make it so. And requirements for robustness of such a program are beyond human comprehension. So will AI kills is - no. Shall we feel threatened by the new technologies - no.

However, as a computer engineering student, I do not buy for even 1 second that AI is an extensional threat to humanity. Here is my rational, feel free to comment, contribute, or post rebuttals!<br><br>Some context if need...<br>&quot;Deep learning&quot; utilizes neural networks. These networks are called such because they are loosely modeled off of the neurons and neuron networks of the natural world; Complete with activation functions (activation energy), weights (synapse), and biases (activation energy bias). They differ from their natural counterparts in that there is some higher level math that governs said parameters instead of bio-chemistry. But the structures, how they learn, and scale up are close enough for comparisons. That last concept is imperative for understanding the rest of this argument.<br><br>My thought process...<br>Currently the worlds most advanced neural network is IBM&#39;s True North Chip (simulated neural networks will be ignored here as their drawbacks means they only have a decade of life left as industry dominate before hardware takes over), with a little over 1 Million neurons. The Human brain on the other hand is around 100 billion neurons. Lets say IBM wanted to make the TrueNorth chip with more neurons but while maintaining its current size. Right now they are using a 25 nm process for the transistors on that chip, and a commonly stated smallest theoretical gate size is 5 nm. If IBM got to the 5 nm process in the next decade and marked the end of Moore&#39;s Law as we know it for silicon, then that means they can only put a maximum 5 million neurons on this chip even if they bring the technology for microprocessors to its theoretical maximum with current materials.<br><br>So lets assume they did exactly that, BAM! 5 Million neurons on 20 mm by 20 mm chip.. pretty freaken cool! But what if we wanted to make something as powerful as a human brain? Well we need 100,000,000,000 neurons so thats going to be about 20,000 of our shiny new made-up TrueNorth Chips. Each chip is 20 mm by 20 mm (this is a rough guess based off of pictures and industry standards) and each chip will need its own supporting chip set, cooling method,  power supply, buses, and ports (aka, motherboard stuff) surrounding it... oh and its own actual mini &quot;normal&quot; computer to help train it and feed/collect its IO data. Lets assume all this auxiliary gear will be about 400 mm by 250 mm. That is 100,000 mm^2 of area per chip. We need 20,000 of these though for our artificial Human brain, so that&#39;s 2,000,000,000 mm^2 of area. Or about 2,000 square kilometers! <br><br>For an AI to have as many neurons as a human brain, it has to live in a computer 2,000 square kilometers in size!!! That is 775 square miles! Or 14 times the size of San Francisco California United States, or 19 times the size of Paris France! And you cant really get any smaller, that&#39;s it... that&#39;s the theoretical smallest size of a transistor; after that quantum effects render the chip useless and that very well may be the case even before we get to a 5 nm process. If the machine is to get any smaller to house our AI friend, we need an entirely new, revolutionary chip architecture, substrate material (something we don&#39;t even know of yet), and manufacturing methods to bring our AI friend down in size. The argument that technology is always progressing with electronics doesn&#39;t apply here, were going to hit a roadblock in the next decade for computer size and we dont even have the slightest idea of what can replace it... even then, lets say we dont hit said road block; we can only go 30 times smaller than to days 14 nm process before were building transistors out of single atoms... YES, ATOMS!!! After that, well there is no after that, thats as far as we go for all we currently know.<br><br>Such is the complexity, and shier brilliance of the Human brain. You are the most organized and complicated structure in the known universe. let that bring you solace and reverence as little nerds like me continue to try and play universe as we imitate your magnificence to no avail for the next 100 years or so... maybe even longer.", "comment_date": "2018-04-03T00:04:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen", "comment_text": "Be afraid of biological weapons.

It cannot rewrite itself unless you let it, cannot fire at humans unless you omit anything that prevents it from doing so. The threat is moreso AI controlled by nefarious people than it is nefarious AI. An AI&#39;s goal is simply to maximize a number, its score, which determines how well it&#39;s doing. This is similar to how humans seek what will release dopamine in the brain. AI in and of itself is not evil, it only follows the goals we set for it. We have to ensure that these goals are never vague. If we can do that, we have nothing more to fear than the people who bear the weapons, which is already what we fear.

Sure AI can kill lots of people very fast, but so can nuclear weapons and machine guns.  In fact, it may seem like on the surface AI is a good thing because it is saving soldiers lives on the battlefield.  However that is exactly why they&#39;re dangerous, it removes the human element of war which throughout the centuries has been a major point in avoiding war, no one wants to die unless they absolutely have to.  It has always been the destruction of life and the human element that has speared peace, or in other words, peace is only achieved ones to many people die and one side has to submit.  Removing humans from the battlefield removes the deterrent of loss of life.  This would make countries more prone to war cause to leaders&#39; eyes they are risking much less with a cheap, easily manufactured robotic army then a professional army.   Another reason AI would be dangerous is it has no moral code, unlike soldiers,  So if there were humans on the battlefield, either soldiers or civilians, the AI would just keep killing.

It&#39;s purely designed to scare people into agreeing with the premise. I can think of positives for this; for instance, less risk to human life and cheaper to maintain. Fewer people will be needed to join the military for defense or offense, allowing the money saved on paychecks to improving other things like social programs (the more people being replaced by AI the greater need for less reliance on work to sustain yourself). You graciously did touch on the subject of faster response times and no fear of self danger, so that instead of shooting someone who is not a real threat, it can wait until actually being attacked to respond lethally or non-lethally. As for fears of use in assassination, well people can already be assassinated or murdered today, I don&#39;t think having drones capable of doing it changes that, just more of the same thing in a different way.

Pointed metal make bullets, and knifes, that are used for virtually all weapons. So we should ban pointed metal when used in weaponry.

The self-driving car uses AI. Should self-driving cars be banned? Elon Musk has already said the equivalent of &quot;oh, those don&#39;t count&quot;.
