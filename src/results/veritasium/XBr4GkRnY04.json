The middle did not move faster than the edges because none of the people actually moved in free space. There was relative velocity between the people but no real velocity since none of them had actually moved through free space. If originally the 25 people were standing on black crosses, they would still be standing on the same black crosses after the expansion. Each person had a zero displacement, therefore zero velocity. Whichever person was the observer, they would see all the other people going away from them, the people furthest from them would have had the biggest relative velocity to them. Imagine you were a person at the end of one of these lines of 5 people. The nearest person to you would have moved an extra 1 metre from you while the person at the other end of the line would have moved 4 metres from you. If you now imagined there were millions of people and they all moved an extra metre apart due to the expansion of free space between each of them how the furthest person could have had a RELATIVE velocity exceeding the speed of light.

But, due to gravity, the expansion rate was rapidly slowing: The Hubble sphere was rapidly growing. Over time, light that was outside the Hubble sphere crossed the boundary to be inside the Hubble sphere, and could eventually reach the Earth and be observed, albeit with a significant redshift (stretching of its wavelength due to the expansion of space). But later, due to dark energy, the expansion rate of the universe began to accelerate: The Hubble sphere began to contract. As dark energy will continue to increase as the universe expands, the expansion rate will also continue to increase from now on, and the Hubble sphere will continue to shrink. Light that is now outside the Hubble sphere will always remain outside the Hubble sphere. We are able to now see objects that are outside the Hubble sphere only because light they had emitted billions of years ago was lucky enough to cross inside the Hubble sphere during the time the expansion rate was slowing, and the Hubble sphere was growing. But now, the expansion rate is accelerating and will continue to do so for all remaining time: The Hubble sphere will continue to shrink for all remaining time.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

When the energy gets more settled, it gives rise to temperature, the bodily sense of fire element. When fire energy gets more settled it gives rise to cohesiveness, the bodily sense of water element. And when itgets more settled it gives rise to the rigidity the bodily sense of earth element. Also the properties each element propagates into the next in the above sequence. So technically earth has all the characters of sound, momentum, temperature, cohesiveness and rigidity is its its own property.<br>Conclusion says that we are a bunch of all these elements.

Then you are on the wrong track...you can all solve these mysteries at home with ordinary household items for experiments..I did.millions and billions is a distraction from the truth as you would obviously take their word for it and except it as they only have the tools to measure these crazy stupid theories...my model solves dozens of mysteries of our reality all at once...that can&#39;t be a coincidence....Newton was very wrong.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T06:30:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jf Master", "comment_text": "The standard model is so absolutely wrong.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T05:18:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeramie Bradford", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t comprehend that big", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T05:04:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eduardo M", "comment_text": "If the Hubble sphere is defined by the distance through which the recession velocity is the speed of light, by definition, it can&#39;t expand since expansion implies in changing that distance.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T01:59:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Vandagriff", "comment_text": "If the universe is infinite, does that mean that somewhere in space there is a solar system exactly like ours, with people exactly like us down to the atom, except one atom on some random fence post somewhere is missing, and any combination in between, while everything else is the same.<br><br> If there&#39;s an infinite arrangement of atoms in existence, is there an exact copy of me, with the same thoughts, writing this comment right now? <br><br>\ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2021-11-10T17:59:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sploof Mcsterra", "comment_text": "Sorry, is your explanation about the Hubble sphere &quot;expanding due to the expansion of the universe&quot; a reverse analysis of how the light reaches us?

Nothing is being &quot;stretched thin&quot; like you would expect.  Take a sealed sphere.  It has a set volume, and a finite amount of mass that exists within it.  If you stretch or expand that sphere, you&#39;re not creating more mass, but rather stretching the distance between all atoms so that your mass fills your volume.  Apply that to the universe.  We don&#39;t see our world getting stretched out, yet we say the universe is expanding.  Those two things would contradict each other.  But that also means that the universe would have a finite volume, even if we can&#39;t see it or detect it yet.  And to take that one step further, we say nothing can be created or destroyed, only change from one form to another.  Meaning you can&#39;t create matter from nothing, or have matter permanently disappear from existence.  That means the universe has a finite amount of mass.  That also means that if it&#39;s expanding, because it&#39;s finite, in order to take up more volume (while maintaining mass), it would have to expand INTO something else, thus, gaining volume.  Now if we say that the universe isn&#39;t expanding &quot;into&quot; anything, it&#39;s just expanding, then we&#39;ve clearly come to the conclusion that there is a separation between &quot;nothing&quot; and &quot;the universe&quot;.  If the universe was literally ALL there is, then it would have no need to expand, as it would already occupy all of existence, making expansion meaningless.  If that&#39;s the case, that means that what we observe as expansion, could actually be everything being COMPRESSED, giving the illusion of an &quot;expanding&quot; universe.<br><br>We are still a &quot;relatively&quot; young species.

Als we nu eens kijken naar de roodverschuiving, dan zien we dat de zogenaamde oerknal nog aan het versnellen is, waar geen wetenschappelijke verklaring voor is, maar die is er wel, alleen moet je wel even de oerknal overboord gooien en moet je ook open staan voor de feiten die we waar nemen, het is namelijk zo, dat de roodverschuiving door krimpende atomen veroorzaakt word, krimpende atomen, een schaal verkleining zorgt er voor, dat onze atomen een hogere frequentie uitzenden en als je dan de ruimte in kijkt en naar het verleden kijkt, zie je de roodverschuiving van atomen die nog niet zo ver zijn gekrompen en hoe verder je terug kijkt hoe groter de verschillen en gaat door het krimpen ook ons klokje sneller tikken, dat zorgt er voor dat het krimpen sneller gaat en de indruk wekt dat we nog aan het versnellen zijn, maar blijven we dus gewoon op onze plaats, dat sluit ook mooi aan, op dat  het licht overal even snel is en we niet allerlei rare verhalen moeten aan horen dat die snelle stelsels hun licht uitzenden in een vacu\u00fcm, omdat het anders moeilijk te verenigen is met de oerknal. door de oerknal aan te hangen, ga je er aan voor bij dat verre stelsels met grotere atomen er anders uit zien als bij een oerknal, waar je opeens donkere materie moet verzinnen om het nog kloppend te maken met de oerknal, dat zal ik wel even uit leggen, we nemen een ver stelsel met 50% roodverschuiving, die heeft atomen die 2 maal zo groot zijn als onze atomen en hebben een 2 maal zo grote diameter, dan zal een ster daar meer massa nodig hebben om kernfusie te veroorzaken, dat betekend dat die ster waar de tijd maar half zo snel is maar een oppervlak heeft dat minstens 4 maal zo groot is zeker 2 maal zo veel licht uit zenden en veel verder staat als je dat met de licht opbrengst denkt te kunnen meten, een stelsel met 75% roodverschuiving , heeft dan atomen die een 4 maal zo grote diameter hebben en zal de afwijking nog veel groter zijn, nou weet ik niet precies hoe men op het idee komt dat we materie missen, maar zit er dus in die verre stelsels dus meer materie in de sterren, wat zelfs nog verder op kan lopen als wat er nu over donkere materie beweerd word en zal die donkere materie die gemist word hoogst waarschijnlijk bij die verre stelsels gemist worden, dat is dus wel een aan name, omdat de informatie over donkere materie nogal wazig is, maar probeert men wel aan te tonen dat het hier ook zou zijn, wat mogelijk een poging is om de oerknal theorie nog te redden. Men zou maar eens op zoek moeten gaan, naar bewijzen die nogal voor de hand liggen, 1 van die bewijzen is dat de Aarde door het verwijderen van de Zon de ijstijden veroorzaakt en zou de Aarde 1 honderdste seconde per jaar er langer over doen om een rondje om de Zon te maken, of men zou even na moeten rekenen waar door de Maan zich 2 cm van de Aarde af beweegt per jaar, waar honderd jaar geleden, werd beweerd, dat het de getijdenkrachten zouden zijn. Het rondje om de Zon zou bijzonder makkelijk zijn, omdat de tijd met enige regelmaat word bijgesteld door een seconden toe te voegen aan het eind van het jaar, als ik daar na vraag en ik vertel dat ik wil bewijzen dat er geen oerknal is maar krimpende atomen, krijg ik daar geen antwoord op, maar iedereen weet dat die tijd heel precies in de gaten word gehouden en zeker sterrenkundigen dat heel precies moeten weten, ik heb een schatting gemaakt, dat de Aarde een honderdste deel van een seconde er per jaar langer over doet, maar word dat mogelijk dus onder de pet gehouden, dat kan natuurlijk niet en zal het niet lang duren voor dat het boven water komt en deze mensen als vervalsers te boek komen te staan door de oerknal ten kostte van alle waarheden proberen overeind te houden.", "comment_date": "2021-09-13T03:08:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Almalki", "comment_text": "i still think lights outside the hubble sphere are lost forever, even more if the expansion is accelerating.", "comment_date": "2021-09-13T00:16:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lil Markos", "comment_text": "Fun fact: if the universe is infinite, that means there are an infinite amount of replicas of you\ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2021-09-12T20:48:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ive Forgotten", "comment_text": "Hey I really loved this video but I do have some questions for anyone who has more knowledge on the topic than I do.<br><br>Is the statement for this video then that the univrse and space is expanding in every direction from every place instead of out from one focal point? and do we have observable proof for this?\u00a0<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m entirely on board with attributing an infinite nature to something that has a calculable origin.

But the explanations don&#39;t seem to resolve with my logic. Wonder whether you could clarify. Your notion is the universe expands after the big bang. I imagine this as a bubble with the location of the big bang in its center. As the bubble expands, distances between objects grow. I imagine the objects moving away from the center at a certain speed (less than C) and radiation created at the moment of the big bang forming the outside edge of that bubble - moving away from the center at C. So, from a God&#39;s eye view, the universe is a bubble expanding at the speed of 2C (1C from the center in each direction). Any object inside is moving at less than C. Do we know at what speed our galaxy is currently moving away from the center? <br>Now, in order for objects moving away from eachother at a speed greater than C, the two objects would have to &quot;move&quot; in roughly opposite directions. Again looking at the universe as a bubble, we would have to measure the increase of distance between two objects in different &quot;hemispheres&quot; of that universe. Right?<br>If that is the case, looking at objects in the same hemisphere, moving roughly in the same direction (away from the center), that distance should never increase by more than C. Right?<br>And if that is the case, why should the hubble sphere be a sphere? How can the distance to the spot where the speed of recession is the speed of light be the same in any direction? After all when we look in the direction of our movement (away from the center of the big bang) all objects move in roughly the same direction.

And this show does an amazing job of delivering these priceless bits of knowledge to us. However, I need to comment on what I just watched. Bearing in mind that this is coming from a man with no formal degree or qualification in astronomy or science beyond a GCSE level, but something didn&#39;t sit right with me. The Hubble Sphere, and the light from distant galaxies that originate from outside of the sphere, becoming sub-luminal as the Hubble Sphere expands. It&#39;s safe to assume that Earth&#39;s position within the Hubble Sphere is fixed, as the Sphere is relative to us. We are always in the centre, as we are the observers. We cannot move from our fixed central position, because any shift we make, alters the horizon. Much like being in an open space where you can see the curvature of the Earth, then moving towards it. You never see past the curve itself, as the curve is relative to your position. So with that being said, our ability to observe light from beyond the horizon of the Hubble Sphere would be akin to seeing around the curvature of the Earth, not possible. The space within the Sphere expanding would not take the horizon and stretch it, as the horizon is relative to our ability to see that far. It&#39;s fixed. Take for example a sheet off stretchy material, pre-stretch. and you place a hoop on it to represent the horizon of the Hubble Sphere. You the stretch the material to replicate the expansion of the universe. The expansion takes place uniformly within and without the horizon, but never altering the horizon. <br><br>Again, I have no doctorate or PhD, I&#39;m just a keyboard warrior with a bone to pick, but to suggest we can see past the observable universe because we&#39;re expanding into it seems to be untrue. Just like I can&#39;t see past the horizon without changing my vantage point, and therefore, changing the position of the horizon. What does seem to be true, is that for us to observe light from beyond the horizon of the Hubble Sphere, is if we travelled towards it. But this only shifts the horizon we experience, never truly expanding it. As we move in one direction towards the edge, we&#39;re moving away from the opposite edge. <br><br>I hope this wasn&#39;t just a splooge of dumb.

Simultaneity is not defined across vast distances, that&#39;s special relativity 101, so there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;right now&quot; for it. But it&#39;s even worse than that, since if you were to try to find any meaningful estimate of where it is right now, you would find the answer to be infinity, because it has gone past the static limit, and is no longer causally connected to you, i.e. if you emitted a beam of light toward it, it would never reach it at all. So the only thing you can actually talk about with integrity is where the stuff you see was, when the light you see was emitted, and that was, of course, 13.8 billion light-years away. So the universe &quot;is&quot; 27.6 billion light-years across.

If you don&#39;t understand, you can help yourself by analogy, for example, when you look in the mirror.

The reason is because of a discrepancy from the point of view of the object beyond the Hubble sphere. <br><br>Light coming from those objects would have to reach us and not just be assumed to reach us if it passes through the Hubble sphere. The distance that light has to travel, from the point of view of the object beyond the Hubble sphere, is already longer than the radius of the Hubble sphere. So for that light to reach us in the initial and added time it takes to travel that distance, while we are moving away faster than the speed of light from that object, it will simply never get to us. And that is because the Earth is already moving away from that object faster than the speed of light. So how can light traveling at the speed of light get to the earth, if the earth is already moving away from that light, faster than the speed of light, from the point of view of that object beyond the Hubble sphere?<br><br>Relativity has shown us that the conclusions from all relativistic points of view must agree. Any object viewed at a distance of the Hubble sphere is moving at the speed of light away from us, so time would slow down to being frozen in time, much like that of an event horizon in a black hole.

But as every scientist knows, when we say the universe is 15 billion years old, there&#39;s another half of the sentence that we rarely bother to say. The other half of the sentence is: The universe is 15 billion years old as seen from the time-space coordinates of the earth.<br><br>The key is that the Torah looks forward in time, from very different time-space coordinates, when the universe was small. Since then, the universe has expanded out. Space stretches, and that stretching of space totally changes the perception of time. Imagine in your mind going back billions of years to the beginning of time. Now pretend way back at the beginning of time, when time grabs hold, there&#39;s an intelligent community. (It&#39;s totally fictitious.) Imagine that the intelligent community has a laser, and it&#39;s going to shoot out a blast of light every second. Every second -- pulse. Pulse. Pulse. And on each pulse of light the following formation is printed (printing information on light, electro-magnetic radiation, is common practice): &quot;I&#39;m sending you a pulse every second.&quot; Billions of years later, way far down the time line, we here on Earth have a big satellite dish antenna and we receive that pulse of light. And on that pulse of light we read &quot;I&#39;m sending you a pulse every second.&quot;<br><br>Light travels 300 million meters per second. So at the beginning, the two light pulses are separated by a second of travel or 300 million meters. Now they travel through space for billions of years until they reach the Earth. But wait a minute. Is the universe static? No. The universe is expanding. The universe expands by space stretching. So as these pulses travel through space for billions of years, space is stretching. What&#39;s happening to these pulses? The space between them is also stretching. So the pulses get further and further apart. Billions of years later, when the first pulse arrives, we read on it &quot;I&#39;m sending you a pulse every second.&quot; A message from outer space. You call all your friends, and you wait for the next pulse to arrive. Does it arrive second later? No! A year later? Maybe not. Maybe billions of years later. Because the amount of time this pulse of light has traveled through space will determine the amount of space stretching that has occurred, and so how much space and therefore how much time there will be between the arrival of the pulses. That&#39;s standard cosmology.<br><br>15 billion years or six days?<br><br>Today, we look back in time and we see approximately 15 billion years of history. Looking forward from when the universe is very small - billions of times smaller - the Torah says six days. In truth, they both may be correct. What&#39;s exciting about the last few years in cosmology is we now have quantified the data to know the relationship of the &quot;view of time&quot; from the beginning of stable matter, the threshold energy of protons and neutrons (their nucleosynthesis), relative to the &quot;view of time&quot; today. It&#39;s not science fiction any longer. A dozen physics textbooks all bring the same number. The general relationship between nucleosynthesis, that time near the beginning at the threshold energy of protons and neutrons when matter formed, and time today is a million million. That&#39;s a 1 with 12 zeros after it. So when a view from the beginning looking forward says &quot;I&#39;m sending you a pulse every second,&quot; would we see a pulse every second? No. We&#39;d see it every million million seconds. Because that&#39;s the stretching effect of the expansion of the universe.<br><br>The Talmud tells us that the soul of Adam was created at five and a half days after the beginning of the six days. That is a half day before the termination of the sixth day. At that moment the cosmic calendar ceases and an earth based calendar starts. . How would we see those days stretched by a million million? Five and a half days times a million million, gives us five and a half million million days. Dividing that by 365 days in a year, that comes out to be 15 billion years. NASA gives a value of about 14 billion years. Considering the many approximations, and that the Bible works with only six periods of time, the agreement to within a few percent is extraordinary. The universe is billons of years old from one perspective and a mere six days old from another. And both are correct!<br><br>The five and a half days of Genesis are not of equal duration. Each time the universe doubles in size, the perception of time halves as we project that time back toward the beginning of the universe. The rate of doubling, that is the fractional rate of change, is very rapid at the beginning and decreases with time simply because as the universe gets larger and larger, even though the actual expansion rate is approximately constant, it takes longer and longer for the overall size to double. Because of this, the earliest of the six days have most of the15 billion years sequestered with them. For the duration of each day and the details of how that matches with the measured history of the universe and the earth, see The Science of God.<br><br>CORRECTION TO THE CALCULATION OF THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE<br><br>Following a talk I gave at AZUSA Pacific University, February 2011, a participant noted that when calculating the expansion ratio of space [that is, by what fraction space had stretched] from the era of nucleosynthesis to our current time, I had neglected to correct for the effect that the increase in the rate of universal expansion has on the current cosmic microwave radiation background. This increase introduces a non-linear effect. [That is, the rate of expansion is not constant, rather the rate is increasing.] The correction is in the order of 10%. Had the expansion been linear [and not super-linear resulting from the increased rate], the CMRB would be, not the currently observed 2.76 K, but 3.03 K. Introducing this correction into the exponential equation that details the duration of the six 24 hour days of Genesis Chapter One results in an age of the universe from our perspective of 14 billion years [14, 000,000,000 years]. From the Bible\u2019s perspective of time for those six evocative days of Genesis, the number of our years held compressed within each of those six 24 hour days of Genesis, starting with Day One, would be, in billions of years, respectively, 7.1; 3.6; 1.8; 0.89; 0.45; 0.23.\u201d<br><br><br>Copyrightcopyrightby Gerald L.

The fastest any two points can move away from each other is two times the speed of light. This is assuming both are traveling at the speed of light, and their light would never reach each other. If the space your light source occupies expands at the speed of light, that light is trapped within that space, essentially like falling into a black hole. Also, Hubble never observed anything moving away at faster than, or anywhere near the speed of light, only that the light was shifted to the red as if it was moving away. This could have been caused by several factors, even possibly properties like refraction (N). There are gobs of hydrogen and other particles that fill the universe,  space is not a perfect vacuum.

Very distant objects are receding faster than the speed of light (space is expanding between them), but thats not the case between close objects.  If you turn on a light switch the room gets light.  That would not have happened at 10^-35th seconds.   As long as the hubble parameter exceeds 0 there will be 2 points far enough from each other that they will recede faster than the speed of light.

It seems that Establishment cosmologists keep &#39;moving the posts&#39;, probably to defend their sacred Model from currently unreported exposes of it.

The biggest &#39;shell game&#39; con in cosmology is that the words &#39;cosmos&#39;, then &#39;universe&#39; were coined to denote &#39;all that there is&#39;.  As millions of galaxies began to be discovered in the early 20th Century, the &#39;sleight of hand&#39; was to tacitly assume that &#39;cosmos&#39; or &#39;universe&#39; denoted the total set of galaxies, and because these words were also known to mean &#39;all that there is&#39;, then the false logic of 20th Century Establishment cosmology said that galaxies (and all there contents) are all that there is.  But there is no proof of this.  It is entirely possible that there is an edge to the total set of galaxies, and that there is some totally different form of matter (mass + energy;  in E = mc^2,  &#39;m&#39; stands for mass NOT matter) beyond the furthest galaxies, none of which, even taking the Red Shifts as evidence of distance, exceed 13.4 billion light years.", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T13:38:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Read Zechariah 12:10", "comment_text": "So many people cannot see the forest for the trees, the only reasonable explanation for the universe and all the Majesty that it holds from the tiniest add to the greatest expanse of space is that God created everything, and other words there is a God.

If light was travelling from the side that it is being generated facing us and the the star is moving in the opposite path the light would be caught in the gravity of the star it is emitting from and the vectors generated by the moving form. You non scientists do not take all things in to account when you try to think it all through. Light does not travel, it emits from the surface that is resonating and shines then reflects of surfaces. It is true that some things glow after they are generated by the physical form that resonates though they are not the light that is being generated they are other physical forms and when they travel they do not emit light visible to the eye, you need a mass spectrometer to see them. If all the light being emitted from a flat surface was travelling with no resistance, all that light will luminate an area the same size no matter how far from it. I knew the Einstein is wrong since I was 2 years young relating to the fastest rate anything can travel and it has been proven that it is possible to travel faster than light. Now I wait for scientists to prove that light does not travel. It EMITS and SHINES and REFLECTS OFF SURFACE. The process for the fastest rate anything can travel is RESISTANCE VERSUS VELOCITY AND INTEGRITY. In space there is resistance in the form of radio active isotopes that people call dark matter, the isotopes are all separated. In  an atom they are joined together. There are other gases in space that form resistance to light and integrity that can act like a solid wall to anything travelling at a specific rate. If you take a stick and wack an other stick slow enough it will disintegrate, if you wack it fast enough it will pass through with minimal destruction, for this reason that you divi&#39;systs have not learned there is no limit to how fast you can travel except if there is a limit to integrity and the energy that can generate velocity.

I understand that things become length contracted as they are moving away, therefore talking about &quot;distance&quot; and &quot;size&quot; for things which are moving at high speed relative to us is problematic.   You see a moving ladder and you know it was 10 meters long when it was standing still, but now it is only 1 meter long cuz it&#39;s going so fast.   So do you say it IS 1 meter or is it 10 meters long?   I&#39;d say that to be correct you would say that it WAS 10meters, but now it is only 1 meter.  Seems like the &quot;size&quot; of a bubble&quot; is problematic.   So when you talk about size what do you mean?   Relative to who and when?     A telescoping ladder is going to look weird and people on different rungs are going to disagree with with the size of various steps.   No mystery there, but even though each nearby rung may recede from the other rung at near the speed of light the<br>next rung is only going to appear to be going &quot;slightly faster and everyone needs to agree that ends of the ladder can&#39;t move faster than the speed of light.   So even though you KNOW it&#39;s got to be bigger, it isn&#39;t, because of time and distance doing funny things. Why should moving galaxies be any different?     A person might &quot;infer&quot; that since the ladder rungs are moving fast, then that the entire ladder is moving apart superluminarily,  but he would be wrong.   The ladder is distorted in all frames of reference and an undistorted ladder does not not exist in any frame of reference, so<br>I would say that the undistorted ladder doesn&#39;t exist, even though it might seem to.   <br><br>Why is an expanding universe any different?  <br><br>Likewise for time.   I have always had a problem with people claiming the universe is 14 billion years old.   I would think that when the universe was more dense, time went at a different rate because of the intense gravitational time dilatation due to the increased density.   So I might think that 1 billion years now is not the same as a billion years 10 billion years ago when gravity dilated time.    So do you mean 14 billion years in todays seconds? or that a person who<br>was born at the big bang would be 14 billion years old?     I would think that these are NOT the same thing.<br><br>I thought Einstein taught us to beware about talking about things in terms of absolutes and that any metric you use is constantly changing.<br>So you can&#39;t JUST say 14 billion light years, or 14 billion years.   You need to be very specific about exactly HOW, WHERE and WHEN the measurement<br>is done.

The universe expanding into itself? Here&#39;s what I mean. You cannot claim or suggest that space is infinite and yet expanding. If it is expanding then in a sense space is &quot;growing&quot; thus space is extending. What is infinite does extend or expand or grow because that precludes that it was once finite. If it was once finite then it has an edge, and end as far out in the universe as it may be. It&#39;s contradictory to say space is infinite and yet expanding and therefore expanding into itself. Because that precludes that space is already where space is expanding to, in which case space is not expanding. If space is not expanding then it is infinite, but space is expanding, meaning space is extending into regions where there was no space (that is what expansion means), thus space is not infinite. it&#39;s elasticity may be though. Plus whether there are multiple theories attempting to postulate an eternal universe however, since we can&#39;t observe the supposed eternity we are left to the mathematics which do not support an eternal universe in any of the three or so major theories existing at the moment. <br><br>An eternal universe is only nothing but theory, what is fact presently, is a universe with a beginning, whether it begun from the collapse of a former, or from one of multiple big bangs as some believe, THIS UNIVERSE, emphasis on this, had a beginning, and according to the mathematics of eternity, all other theories such as the infinite multiverse or recurring universe also must have a beginning. Infinity is not equal to eternity, an infinite universe (which we don&#39;t have) or multiverse is therefore not necessarily eternal. And since the space in this universe, the only one we know of, is expanding, it is definitely not infinite and mathematically not eternal as well. It had a beginning, therefore it had a cause. That is the argument that many are running away from. If it had a beginning the what caused the beginning. This universe consists of space-time, matter, dark matter and energy. One may say space-time is eternal, but it cannot produce or energy in the absence of either of the two, neither can laws of physics, as these &quot;laws&quot; are merely observed behaviours of matter and energy in space, if there is no matter or energy there are no laws of physics. For instance,Stephen Hawkings brings up the law of gravity as being able to create something out of nothing, which is absurd. That laws can create. I&#39;d love for the laws of mathematics to create me some money, the law of flotation doesn&#39;t create boats, the laws of motion don&#39;t create movement, the laws in quantum physics cannot create, no law creates, they merely describe what is. The law of gravity does not create matter, it doesn&#39;t even create gravity, it describes matter&#39;s curvature of spacetime. Space and time are inseparable, if space is eternal, then time must be eternal (just my thoughts guys) but this is contradictory as time is not eternal. Mathematics don&#39;t support an eternal universe (of any kind per the existing theories such as Dawking&#39;s multiverse), we can&#39;t pin it on space for it does not exist without time and so far as is known, time is not eternal therefore space cannot be eternal, Hawkings tries to pin it on the law of gravity, Prof. John Lennox kills that view completely.<br><br> We realise that eternity is required to give rise to our universe, but aside God, eternity cannot be ascribed to any other thing, the more we try, the more it fails. For myself and a growing body in Science, there is a creator or first cause or whatever you call it, there is more scientific evidence for it than against it. There is a creator, He is God. He would have to be superpersonal to give rise to personal and social beings, we can have a relationship with Him. I have come to know Him through Jesus Christ. My Atheistic, skeptical and agnostic days are over really, but my studying days are not, but the more that is discovered of the Universe, the more I see of God. Lastly, let&#39;s bear in mind that statements of Scientist are not statement of science.

I think this is a continuous cycle without a beginning or end, just a &#39;new&#39; universe created once Dark Energy gets to a certain strength. <br><br>Ok so a little meat on the bones on\u00a0this theory: <br><br>We now have pretty much indisputable\u00a0evidence that Dark Energy&#39;s effect is increasing with time (well space actually) in that the further things are apart from each other in the universe the faster they are moving apart from each other due to an unexplained force we have called dark energy. Most theories have this cosmological constant as just that, a constant (per volume of the universe) but there are theories out there at suggest the cosmological constant might not be so constant after all. In my theory cosmological &#39;constant&#39; actually increases in strength with time. If this happen then the universe&#39;s expansion will continue to accelerate at an exponential rate, one day all the galaxies will have moved away from each other, then the Milky Way will get ripped apart by Dark Energy, then the solar system, then the moon from its orbit, then the Earth itself, then\u00a0molecules, then orbiting electrons from atoms, then nucleus of atoms but when we get to the force levels needed to rip\u00a0protons and neutrons themselves apart Dark Energy hits a problem. It takes more energy to overcome the binding force of quarks inside the protons and neutrons\u00a0than it takes to create new quarks ie if you pull 2 quarks apart you just end up with 4 quarks (2 sets of paired quarks). <br>So this would give us &#39;spontaneous creation of matter&#39;, sound familiar? <br>As all baryonic matter in the universe is identical at the subatomic level (we believe) and Dark Energy&#39;s concentration is identical throughout the universe (we believe) then when Dark Energy reaches the required strength of being able to tear protons and neutrons apart it will be a simultaneous explosion of matter everywhere in the whole universe, exactly like we think of the big bang today in an infinite universe. The similarities don&#39;t stop there, this would create a vast &#39;sea of quarks&#39; (like we believe exists just after the big bang). The expansion is at such a rate that only very close particles would be causally connected and so create a CMB as we see today. An interesting quirk of this theory is how would dark energy at these force levels interact with black holes? It would take longer for dark energy to overcome the colossal gravitational forces inside super massive black holes, this would leave to a slight gravitational discrepancy and if this is within your observable universe then lead to things like The Great Attractor.\u00a0<br>One final leap of faith for this theory is I believe that the source of the gravitational force and the source of dark energy will have a common thread. So the sudden creation of so much matter (a universe amount of matter) causes Dark Energy to &#39;stall&#39; but there is a fraction of second delay in this stalling which accounts for inflation. All of this leads to the universe as we see today without the complexities of what caused the big bang, what was before the big bang...? Dark Energy simply\u00a0builds up again over\u00a0billions of years and the process happens all over again. <br><br>I call this process &#39;Loadwickation&#39;.<br><br>Let me know your thoughts of this theory, any questions you have.", "comment_date": "2018-05-25T19:38:40Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Rama Davince", "comment_text": "So,, light move faster than light due to the expandtion of universe,,???

Let me try to explain in just a few sentences, if that is even possible. First, each individual observer can only live in a universe that is 30 million light years wide. Do to expansion, any object that is at the edge of the Hubble sphere (15 million light years away) will be moving away faster than the speed of light. If and observer had a special communication device that allowed him or her to view a clock that was at the edge of the sphere, that observer would see that time was stopped. This means that nothing, including light, can move relative to that observers perspective. Basically, every individual observer has his or her on universe perspective in which time slows down and eventually pauses once the observed space is at a point of super C (speed of light) expansion. I am not saying that the universe can not expand beyond 30 million light years. I am saying your individual perception of the universe, and my individual perception of the universe, and an extra-terrestrials perception of the universe will only every be as wide cub C expansion will allow. In other words, even if the universe has expanded to 93,000,000,000 light years wide, the farthest point will never be farther that 15 million light years away because anything we observe at that point has stopped moving.", "comment_date": "2017-02-26T22:12:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ANKIT GUPTA", "comment_text": "you r not able to co relate your word wrt to your story...... and your expressions are also not impressive.", "comment_date": "2017-02-26T18:46:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Idiarte", "comment_text": "if the universe is expanding, what lies beyond where the universe hasn&#39;t expanded yet? if I were to reach it, what would happen? could I ever reach it?

And, even if they did, it would not affect the velocity of light toward the Earth which would remain 186,000 miles per second in all cases if one believes in one of the basic postulates of the Special Theory of Relativity.  Size of the cosmos?  Simple.  It&#39;s infinite and, most likely, we will find that our Big Bang universe is only one of an infinite number of them spread throughout the infinite volume of our cosmos with all in the same process of expansion.  How long do they expand?  Until their outer expanding spherical boundary layer of galaxies encounter those of adjacent galaxies.  At that point, the colliding galaxies can coalesce and form a infinite collection of Super Black Holes or SBH that are larger than our solar system.  These continue to grow in mass until some point is reached at which time a sort of natural escape mechanism is set in motion.  That mechanism has the power to temporarily neutralize the enormous gravity field that holds the matter together inside of the SBH.  At that time, a SBH explodes with an explosion of unimaginable power and the matter and energy contained in the SBH are hurled out into space to eventually cool, form atoms, then clouds of hydrogen gas, then galaxies, then stars, then planets, then biospheres, then cells, then multicellular organisms, then sentient humanoid lifeforms who go on to create civilizations, religions, governments, sciences, technology, etc.  And so, here we are.  Our current local universe is about 13.6 billion years old and the unexpected speed up of distant galaxies is probably due to the gravitational attraction they are feeling toward the incoming galaxies from the expanding universes surround ours.  How long do we have before our Milky Way galaxy gets sucked into a growing SBH?  Hard to tell exactly, but we might have 10 to 20 billion more years to go.  Then those sentient beings that wish to survive will have to sit out the end of our present cosmos in some sort of spacecraft that can be parked between the forming SBH and be prepared to keep its crew alive for several tens of billions of years in a cosmos devoid of light.

You attribute a different phenomenon betwween space expanding and motion through space. This is nothing but a trick of the mind. Space cannot expand since ultimately, if you remove everything from space then all you have is nothing and nothing cannot do anything, including expand. Now don&#39;t bother me with vacuum energy and the like to try and make out space is never nothing. That won&#39;t wash. If you expand space and include the vacuum energy as part of it, then you are saying that vacuum energy expands ,....and faster than light. This is impossible. Let me show you where current thinking has got it wrong. The faster you go, the slower your clock and the shorter your length until at &quot;c&quot;, your clock has stopped and your length has decreased to zero (in the fore/aft direction). But only one of these is real, the other, is an illusion. Length contraction is purely relative since proper lengths never change, neither for the pilot nor the stationary observer. They just look like they do from each other&#39;s perspective. Time, on the other hand does slow down in absolute terms and this is evident from the time lost on the pilot&#39;s watch. His clock really was running slower due to his speed. Time dilation and therefore time itself is a real objective phenomenon in the void. This can only mean one thing, that there actually IS a preferred reference frame that we can travel through. This is the field of TIME. Yes, time is wavelike in nature, going through sinusoidal cycles of faster then slower time rates. It is a standing wave throughout space. As you move through this wave, the wavelength for you gets longer and time slows down. Your progress into the future slows because we all exist within this waveform. Stay still and you are driven into the future at the rate of time defined by the wave. Move through it though, and the wave red shifts and so you are driven into the future at a relatively slower rate than your static friend. You don&#39;t know it but when you stop he has aged more than you, because he has been driven into the future by the standing wave of time but you have been driven by the red shifted wave that you experienced during motion. What;s this got to do with universal expansion? Well it&#39;s relevant because you get the meaning of differential time rates and the effect on your clock but also on your dimensions or volume. The faster your clock, the bigger space looks relative to someone with a slower clock. Now this is the crunch. Suppose time were slightly faster now than it was eons ago and has been speeding up a little over time. This would, in reality show us an expanding space and current theory and beliefs see it this way. BUT, you might now see that dimensions or space or volume is actually CREATED by the passage of time. It is emergent from time. Time is the reality but space is just an ilusion. Without the passage of time distances have no meaning. The faster time goes, then distances look greater when compard to the same distances in the past and THIS is what Hubble observed. He observed the speeding up of time but naturally interpreted it to be the expanding of space (due to the observed red shift). Remember, if you slow time, then light from that region is red shifted, (e.g. in a gravity well), and so it is logical to deduce that time passed slower in the past than it does now from the observed red shift, NOT that space is expanding. Hubble got it wrong. At the moment of the big bang, there was no wave and no time and so, no space. The only thing necessary to creat the universe is the begining of time. Everything else stems from this one field, the field of time, a wave form of quantised energy that has given birth to all matter in its early phase. Of course, for this to happen there must be an identicle, negative wave for our &quot;positive wave in which we exist and that gives us a net zero energy at all time for all time.

You can&#39;t measure speed of something relative to space. That would, in itself, be a fundamental violation of relativity principles. The reason why two distant objects can move apart faster than light is because speed of light limit is a local one. Without getting into mathematical details, two nearby objects can never be moving relative to each other faster than light. Furthermore, I could keep adding objects, and still no pair of nearby objects would be moving faster than light relative to each other. If space was not expanding, and there was no curvature, this would imply a global speed of light limit. If two objects far apart were receding faster than light in a non-expanding universe, I could place grains of sand in between moving in such a way as to cause some two nearby grains of sand to move faster than light relative to each other - a contradiction.

When Albert Einstein introduced his Theory of Relativity in the early 20th century, however, he suggested that time wasn&#39;t separate from space but connected to it. Time and space combined to form space-time, and everyone measures his or her own experience in it differently because the speed of light (300,000 km per second) is the same for all observers. In other words, if all observers have to agree on the speed of light being 300,000 km per second, then they can&#39;t agree on the time it takes for other objects to travel relative to them.<br>Einstein also suggested that space-time wasn&#39;t flat, but curved or &quot;warped&quot; by the existence of matter and energy. Large bodies in space-time, like the Earth, aren&#39;t just floating in orbit. Instead, imagine an apple resting on a stretched out blanket -- the weight of the apple warps the sheet. If the Earth is an apple, then we can imagine the Earth&#39;s blanket as space-time.<br>This means that someone moving through space-time will experience it differently at various points. Time will actually appear to move slower near massive objects, because space-time is warped by the weight. These predictions have actually been proven. In 1962, scientists placed two atomic clocks at the bottom and top of a water tower. The clock at the bottom, the one closer to the massive center of the Earth, was running slower than the clock at the top. Einstein called this phenomenon time dilation.<br>A further explanation of the bending of space-time and time dilation came in the form of a thought experiment called the twin paradox, devised in 1911 by French physicist Paul Langevin. If one twin lives at the foot of a mountain and the other lives at the top, the twin closer to the Earth will age more slowly. He or she would turn out younger than the other twin, though by a very small amount. If you sent one twin in a spaceship accelerating close to the speed of light, however, he or she would return much younger than the other twin, because high acceleration and large gravitational masses are the same in relativity. Of course, no one&#39;s gone so far as to send somebody&#39;s twin into high-speed orbit, but scientists proved the hypothesis true in the &#39;70s by sending an atomic clock into orbit. It returned to Earth having run much slower than grounded atomic clocks", "comment_date": "2016-07-05T14:08:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joecool", "comment_text": "Why is the Hubble sphere getting larger?

So it is true because there is a probability that it can be such? That is not a fact that is an assumption. There is a measure of error there don&#39;t you think? Lets just go with what you see is what you get for now. We are in a bubble that is decompressing space. There is a medium that all space is connected with and mater divides it. It can also divide itself due to density changes. Since we know there is a ton of cold plasma out there I would say it is plasma based and we are floating and churning it up. This plasma can be condensed and evaporated into and from solid form. Black holes are solid single cell entities and the divided plasma provides all energy transfers we see. Now you say how does the plasma divide itself.. Well double layers and density changes. Any time the density changes of this plasma it form a skin or double layer between the two densities. We see this around our planet in the cloud layers because plasma is in between everything just in differing densities. Normal lensing issues pertain to this as well. How far down the density of plasma is I don&#39;t know but it is the space between atoms is the smallest we can see yet. We can&#39;t view inside of the &quot;Electron&quot; shell because it acts like a screen. That is why it looks round but I bet it is a double ended so a 2 part whole plasmoid. I&#39;m working on a model to see if it can explain it all. From voltage induction to magnetic fields. Plasma particles so small i doubt we would ever be able to see them. They are very dynamic energy vehicles. One carries charges and is filled with space and the other is a set voltage conductor that is shaped like a pyramid. They are the highway for the charges to follow. Charges are positive and the highway is the negative. The 3d version of the Sierpinski Triangle shows both the vehicle and highway the vehicle travels around. The highways grows between large bodies of mass. Yes they grow, it is dynamic right? What is causing us to see further is the pathways growing and allowing us to see the connected mater in the Universe. The Universe isn&#39;t growing in one direction it is breathing just on a scale we wouldn&#39;t know about yet. This breathing compresses and decompresses the plasma raising and lowering the density of plasma. This of course changes the density of plasma in mater as well due to increased pressure or vacuum from all around the Universe. When you change the density of plasma in anything it allows it to magnify it&#39;s energy capabilities. The sun churns the plasma and spits it out and we get that as a two part thing. One is the charge is applied to our ionosphere and then the vehicle for that potential falls to the earth attracted to the mirror image deep in the very center of our core. The hydrogen mixes with oxygen in our atmosphere and creates WATER. The hydrogen was a condensate of the plasma in the sun as well as anything else you get from the sun. The hydrogen holds the plasma between it&#39;s body of gas. remember mater divides the plasma. Si it gets dragged here. Magnetic fields look like a slinky spring around magnets made of flower petals. Check it out on your tube. That magnetic flower is all around our planet. It&#39;s just plasma in a different density then the surrounding plasma. Plasma and plasma density can describe it all. We just need to model it and let it simulate. Oh and the preferred dynamic arrangement is the pyramid. It moves because of the surface potentials with the tip being an automatic targeting system for the base potential voltage as a drive. Like I said i got to model it and the 3d version of the triangle i mentioned above is the way it assembles both positive (Red) and the negative (Blue).

Also true that recent theories came about a white hole. A place from where matter would actually get spilled out from a black hole once it dies.

Just like we orbit the sun and the sun the center of the galaxy so does the galaxy orbit the center of the cluster and the cluster the center of the super cluster, and maybe there are even larger things. Thinkgs will collide. Centers of gravity are moving away from each other making these collisions rarer as the matter scatters around the Universe. For some people is hard to imagine that everything is moving farther. But you got to remember that we&#39;re actually in a 3D Universe. 2D is not a perfect representation of the expansion. But pick a ballon draw some galaxies or stars and inflate the ballon.

Although you asked for information, you don&#39;t have &quot;Reply&quot; enabled on your comment.<br><br>We see very distant galaxies in the Observable Universe in light which has traveled from the distant past, when the galaxies were much nearer to the earth than they are now. For example, NASA announced in May the\u00a0most distant galaxy from the earth which has ever been spectroscopically confirmed. It has been designated\u00a0EGS-zs8-1, and\u00a0the redshift of its light has been spectroscopically measured as Z=7.73.\u00a0The travel time of the light from this galaxy to the earth (called the &quot;lookback time&quot;) was 13.1 billion light years (95% of the current age of the universe). When the galaxy emitted the light, it was located only 3.4 billion light years from the earth. In the 13.1 billion years that it took the light to get to the earth, the galaxy has\u00a0been carried outward with expanding space to its present position 29.6 billion light years\u00a0from the earth.<br><br><br>So the direct answer to your question about how it is that we can see light NOW that has traveled for 14 billion years from objects that are 14 billion light years away is that we can&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t work that way in an expanding spacetime. In this case, the light finally got to the earth after traveling 13.1 billion years from the distant past when the galaxy was MUCH nearer at 3.4 billion light years, and is now located MUCH farther away at 29.6 billion light years.<br><br><br>Only in a static spacetime, such as within the gravitationally bound stars of the Milky Way (where spacetime does not expand), can we infer, for example, that a light travel\u00a0TIME of 10,000 years correctly infers a\u00a0DISTANCE of 10,000 light years. That works for our local\u00a0STATIC spacetime within a\u00a0couple of\u00a0million light years out to Andromeda for example, but it does not work at\u00a0the vast\u00a0distances of\u00a0EXPANDING spacetime\u00a0across distances\u00a0of hundreds of millions....and billions of light years between\u00a0distant galaxies.<br>\u00a0<br><br>We see galaxies in the observable universe of today which\u00a0emitted light in the distant past when they were closer to the earth; and while their light traveled to the earth, they have moved\u00a0outward to greater distances. From the standpoint of the light photons, they\u00a0have moved through their local spacetime toward the earth at the universal constant speed of light, while they have simultaneously been swept outward from the earth with expanding spacetime. (They are always swimming against the current of expanding spacetime.)\u00a0That&#39;s why, in this example, it took the light 13.1 billion years to get to the earth across an expanding distance of space that was only 3.4 billion light years, when they were emitted by the galaxy.\u00a0<br><br><br>The calculated values from the redshift data are\u00a0according to the\u00a0standard theoretical model of cosmology based on the FLRW metric and the Lambda-CDM expansion model.", "comment_date": "2015-06-17T12:31:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan M.", "comment_text": "I have a question that i cant seem to find the answer to, so if anyone can help me id appreciate it :)<br><br>    I understand everything in this video and what ive read online. Here is where i get confused. how come we can see light 14 billion light years away? The light 14 billion light years away didnt expand to that radius within fractions of a second after the big bang. Those galaxies giving of light a little over 14 billion light years away just got there recently, close to our lifetimes. My point is to see light 14 billion light years away, that light had to be there more than 14 billion years ago (because of the speed of light plus some time due to the expansion of space)  i feel like the observable universe should be much smaller. The universe did not start at an initial radius of 14 billion light years. <br><br>I hope its not too confusing. Im confused myself on my thoughts lol.

I suspect because &quot;moving&quot; and &quot;expanding&quot; is failing to clarify whether object is moving through its own local space (and so increasing distance away from us) \u00a0or that the space in-between is expanding and the galaxy beyond is therefore at a greater distance because it is coasting on the wave as it were. So here are some questions to break this down:<br>1) Aside from space expanding after the Big Bang, objects are also moving through their local space at sub-light speed and thus receding from us (unless locally close and attracted by gravity to us, such as local group of galaxies) ? i.e. as well as space expansion from the Big bang is there also true movement of distance objects through their local space away from each other too ?<br>2) The Objects beyond the Hubble Horizon are receding from us not because they are travelling faster than light through their own space (for that would break Special Relativity), but because the space itself over that distance is expanding faster than the rate of light can propagate (through the greater amount of space to be crossed).<br>3) Why then is the Hubble boundary expanding outwards faster than rate that the light from that receding galaxy is also receding from us (which I thought was receding at a rate faster than light could locally cross space towards us to narrow the distance - after all, it is receding from us faster than the speed of light as a result of the space expanding) ? .<br>4) now I get that if there is true motion of a galaxy through space (ignoring expansion of space for a moment) then then light comes to us still at a speed we observe as &quot;c&quot; (rather than c less the speed of the source galaxy) because of Special Relativity altering time by appropriate amount and the observation of light is always at &quot;c&quot; for all observers. But if the space itself is expanding at a rate E, then whether a photon can approach us is set by whether c&gt;E (but then having reached our local space it arrives at our observation as purely &quot;c&quot; speed). But if E&gt;c then the photon can never approach into our local space faster than the amount of space is expanding... so I&#39;m failing to make the last connection to how photons from beyond a given point of space expansion can still be coming to us....", "comment_date": "2015-04-15T21:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alspal", "comment_text": "Im no physicist so i wanna run this past some people.

Let me know if this is not clear. \u00a0<br><br>You wrote:<br>-----------------------------------------<br>\u201cDirectly from the paper:<br><br>&quot;Light that superluminally receding objects emit propagates towards us with a local peculiar velocity of c, but since the recession velocity at that distance is greater than c, the total velocity of the light is away from us (Equation (20)). However, since the radius of the Hubble sphere increases with time, some photons that were initially in a superluminally receding region later find themselves in a subluminally receding region. They can therefore approach us and eventually reach us.&quot;<br><br>My very simple question is: Why does entering the Hubble Sphere automatically mean that we can now observe the superluminal objects.\u201d<br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>Answer:<br><br>The quote from the paper describes the fact that outside the Hubble Sphere in superluminal space the peculiar velocity of the photons with a local velocity toward the earth at the velocity of c, has a recession velocity away from the earth greater than c. So the total velocity of the photons is away from the earth and they never get here.<br>On the other hand, the Hubble Sphere increases over time and takes some photons inside it that were previously outside it. Then, inside the Hubble Sphere, the peculiar velocity of the photons still have a local velocity toward the earth of c, but now the recession velocity away from the earth is less than c. So then the total velocity of the photons inside the Hubble Sphere is toward the earth, and they will eventually reach the earth and be observed.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>I\u2019ll correct a couple of misconceptions in your question that might confuse the issue.<br><br>1) You say: \u00a0\u201cThe radius of the Hubble Sphere increases at the speed of light.\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>This is a common misconception. The radius of the Hubble Sphere separates subluminal space from superluminal space, and is therefore the distance from the earth where SPACE is expanding exactly at the speed of light,. But the HUBBLE SPHERE is a mathematical construct, not a physical object or surface, and it does not expand with space. It\u2019s true that the Hubble Sphere increases in size over time, but not at the rate of expansion of the universe. In fact, it expands relatively more rapidly than the universe, and specifically not at the speed of light. That is essential to the fact that the Hubble Sphere expands outward and takes within itself photons that are originally outside it.<br><br>2) You say: \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAs you can see the light is still moving away from us but slower than the rate of expansion of the Hubble Sphere. This means that the light will enter the Hubble Sphere, but continue moving away from us.\u201d<br><br>Light which is within the Hubble Sphere NEVER moves away from the earth. Light moves toward the earth at the universal constant speed of light, and within the Hubble Sphere, space is expanding (and carrying light photons with it) at LESS than the speed of light.

A supernovae pushes down on that rubber so much that it rips it, which causes a pressure-loss like thing that may happen in an airplane, or space shuttle. All material around the opening/rip starts being pulled in, including light. And this sheet of rubber, along with many others, is in a  big mega-universe. All this material starts leaking out of this hole. When enough energy from the multiple sheets of rubber, or universes collects, it all begins forming/collecting in a small point, until the the point becomes unstable and filled to the brim with all this matter and energy, and begins expanding into it&#39;s own sheet of rubber/universe. Sometimes, the energy pre-expands, causing instant, or quick deaths of certain universes. These universes continue to expand, until they arrive at a thermal equilibrium.

The essential point of this video, and the absolutely irrefutable proof of the redshift data and the standard candle measurements of distances using Type Ia supernovae, shows that the expansion of space at great distances is much greater than the speed of light relative to the earth-based observer. So 13 billion years have passed since the big bang, and the observable universe (expanding faster than light) now has a radius of 46 billion light years. What can you possibly think is not \u201clogical\u201d about that?<br><br>Maybe you think it\u2019s illogical that light from the edge of the observable universe at a distance of 46 billion light years could ever get to the earth in the 13 billion years since the big bang.

The Observable Universe we see today is observed in redshifted light from the distant past, when the universe was much smaller and the objects we now see were much closer to the earth. The current 46 billion year distance is a calculated value of the present distance using the FLRW metric and the LambdaCDM expansion model, based on redshift data from the past. The galaxies at these current distances are now far beyond the Hubble Sphere and the Particle Horizon, and the light they emit today will never be seen on earth at any time in the future.

So the universe is the same wherever you are, and looks the same in whatever direction you look.<br><br>The metric expansion of that homogeneous and isotropic universe means that everything is moving away from everything else, and the objects farther away from any point are moving away from that point faster than the objects that are closer to it. This means that any observer in space, wherever he is, sees himself at the center of a uniform expansion that he observes as he looks out in any direction from his point of observation.<br><br>There are two possibilities as to the ultimate dimensions of the universe. It may be bounded or unbounded\u2026..finite or infinite. If it\u2019s infinite in size, it cannot possibly have a geometric center, because there are no boundaries for anything to be the center OF. The other possibility is that the universe might be finite. But even if that\u2019s so, the boundaries are so far beyond the Observable Universe that we can never observe them, and they cannot possibly have any physical effect within the Observable Universe. So while there might in theory be a geometric center to a finite universe, there is no way to identify where it is, and no preferred location within the Observable Universe.<br><br>So we are left with the fact that our Observable Universe is a spherical volume of space that we\u2019re at the center of, since we see the same large scale universe at the same distance in whatever direction we point our telescopes. And since the nature of expanding space makes every point of observation appear to be the origin of the expansion, then we are not only at the center of our Observable Universe, we inevitably see ourselves at the origin of the expansion of that Observable Universe.<br><br>Therefore the theory of cosmology is based on an observer who is at rest at the center of the expanding Observable Universe. Since there is no identifiable center to the universe, and since every point in the universe appears to be the center of the expansion, then for both theoretical and observational purposes, the observer on earth is at the center of the universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-05T13:50:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Willy Durf", "comment_text": "\u00a0\u00a0 Interesting concept but how can we know the reality of the speed of light given the fact we just in the last 100 years understood it, or should i say measured it.

New telescopes and satellites have gathered data that Sagan never dreamed of and Arp never saw. The suggestion that there might be doubt about the expansion of the universe based on the analysis of redshift, in light of the data currently available to science, would simply be laughed out of the room. In Sagan\u2019s time, the debate over the measured redshift and inferred distances of the quasars had not been totally resolved. Today, there is no doubt of the nature and distance of the quasars or the nature of the cosmological redshift. The early quasar redshift data that Arp would not believe was cosmological in nature when he saw it before his eyes, were on the order of Z = 1 or 2. Today, data from the Hubble Deep Field images show redshifts from the farthest galaxies near the edge of the observable universe (far beyond the quasars), with redshifts on the order of Z = 8 being routinely observed. Cosmological redshift is exactly what science says it is, and it defines the very nature of the expanding universe.<br><br>Arp and others asked reasonable questions while the issue was still in dispute, but when they wouldn&#39;t change their minds when the matter was finally settled, they made fools of themselves.

Without the universe how could the galaxy be there and everything within it? It wouldn&#39;t. <br>If there is nothing outside the universe then would the vastness of nothing not have prohibited the beginning of a universe. Nothing is a bit of a ridiculous concept because what the hell is nothing? We don&#39;t have any example of it anywhere in the universe so how could we possibly be expanding into our own universe contained in nothing when nothing doesn&#39;t exist inside the universe?

Not because of wiki haha. Assume I threw a ball towards Derek at 1 ball a second at say 40 Metre throws, whilst simultaneously moving backwards at 1m a second. Derek, only looking directly down and also moving forward at 1m/sec, sees a ball every second. If he realizes that each ball has come from the same direction then he can logically assume that someone has put it there. With each ball and no thrower he finds then he can assume the thrower is further away than he is able to see. The problem is that I the thrower will always be a minimum of 40m in front of where Derek is looking (directly down). Let&#39;s say I&#39;m actually throwing 100m or any distance for that matter. Derek will always find 1 ball a second.

To me it seems it could be impossible to tell whether we are expanding or contracting because we can not get more than one earthly perspective and we would need multiple perspectives from around the universe to confirm it. Even then, we are bound to the field of our galaxy and beyond that to a much greater field and we cannot perceive if there is an even greater one. The fields are what give us a perception of time. Time is not a thing, just like distance is not a thing. It is a perception based on other perceivable events or objects. Therefore if we are subject to multiple fields, one could be expanding while the other is contracting and we would not have any idea if we could not perceive the variables which affect our observation.

I&#39;m ok with that. But what if another guy went the other way at the same speed as well? Let&#39;s say it takes place in space, not on Earth. Each of them would see the other as moving at 0,6c relative to the stationary himself. So each of them would see the time in the other ship flowing slower(if I&#39;m not mistaken here) than in his own. At the same time, I would see both times flowing differently from my own time, but the same for both of them.<br><br>Now the question: where is the mistake here? If they were moving at 0,6c relative to the stationary observer, and therefore at like 1,2c relative to each other(which happens to the galaxies described in the video), would they actually move past each other that fast, but maybe physically unable to interact with each other in ANY way, or would the relativistic time compression somehow /squeeze/ this speed below 1c through the change in their time perception? Or is there some even stranger wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff going on here?...<br><br>Would they even be able to somehow verify how fast they are moving through the universe? Or, to them, would everything outside seem slower? Could an outside stationary observator verify that it is in fact himself and the planets, stars etc that are stationary, with the spaceship going a fraction of c, and not the other way around? Or is this a wonderful case of &quot;it doesn&#39;t even matter here&quot;?

This has been &#39;confirmed&#39; here on Earth by extra-terrestrial particles reaching the surface of the planet when their speed of decay should show them dying out somewhere in the outer atmosphere; but do to time dilation and distance compression a large majority of the particles reach the surface when mathematically (when not accounting for the theory of relativity and the particle speeds nearing c) none of them should come close.", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T02:49:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Barnes", "comment_text": "I&#39;m confused.

I say B.S. When one can not even explain what light is, I find it silly to make a claim that light is the fastest. what if you lined up a whole bunch of of highly compressed balls (in space and its vacuum), side by side for 372000 miles and then right beside that line of balls, you laid a flashlight and at the same instant you struke the first ball you turned on the light, which would be at the 372,000 mile mark first the light or the energy from striking the first ball? what if you did it at 744000 miles would the result be the same or different? what if you did it for 186,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles, would the result be different or the same????

It is actually the one thing that indicates they are not.<br>I guess this is why c seems so &#39;universally constant&#39; and generally relativistic. We only call it &quot;the speed of light&quot; because it&#39;s the closest semi-direct thing we can measure that is a consequence of this unity. Hence discussions about stuff going faster than the speed of light tend to end up in total gibberish, because the fundamental ideas are faulty to begin with and the terminology is ever so confusing.<br><br>Prove me wrong and I will gladly change my mind to something that will be equally wrong but hopefully slightly more amazing. :)", "comment_date": "2014-05-30T10:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eddie A.", "comment_text": "@ImagineCraft7 A lonely Dunkin&#39; Donuts.", "comment_date": "2014-05-30T10:27:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lord Of The World", "comment_text": "Which direction is our solar system moving?

While the people on earth would be long gone by the end of the expedition, people on board a vessel that was travelling the speed of light could like survive. This is because by getting extremely close to the speed of light the people on board would be going through time at a rate in which our time on earth would go by x times more then the vessels had, where x is some number based on how close the vessel is to light speed (x approaches infinity as velocity, v, approaches c, the speed (or velocity, as it is actually meant in science) of light.

Expansion would not allow interaction. Some galaxies are, at least apparently, moving toward each other. Dark matter and dark energy were made up to explain this movement and the supposed lack of matter keeping galaxies together. My theory says that the visible matter in galaxies are enough to hold them together. There is however not enough matter in any one galaxy to alter the course of another if expansion is actually happening. Since the big bang expansion has been driving all galaxies further apart, none are slowing down, therefore their direction can not be altered. If this is not true, then the big bang is also not true, then expansion is not true. We are simply part of an infinite existence. Our galaxy is part of one universe and our universe is built the same as a galaxy, the same as a planetary system. One massive object in the center with other masses in orbit. Our sun and it&#39;s planets. Our supermassive black hole with all the stars in the galaxy in orbit. Another super massive object at the center of our universe with all it&#39;s galaxies in orbit around it. Other universes would be out there too just as ours in our infinite existence.

The Borde Guth Vilenkin theorem is a conclusive mathematically sound proof that our universe, which has been on average expanding since its conception, must have had an <i>absolute</i> beginning, at some point in the finite past.

That is what we can know for a fact. So unless we bring religion or beliefs about ultimate cause/nature of origin into the equation, then we aren&#39;t really in a position to speak about what lay beyond that, and therefore have no clear reasons to think that <i>the</i> universe has existed infinitely since eternity. &quot;Misconceptions About the Universe&quot;... ;)", "comment_date": "2014-05-27T19:08:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Virtlink", "comment_text": "The universe is <i>not</i> infinite.

I seem to recall a thought experiment that if two objects were moving towards each other, each at 75% the speed of light, the intuitive relative speed from the perspective of one of them would be 150% the speed of light (75 + 75) but actually the limit is still the speed of light due to time dilation.
