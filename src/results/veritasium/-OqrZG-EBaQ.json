He says, &quot;if we don&#39;t care, if we don&#39;t put in any effort, it&#39;s not going to turn out well&quot;.  But if we do care, if we put in the effort, well, the effort to do what?<br><br>One option is to pipe ocean water to the Salton Sea, so that it maintains a constant water level, and becomes saturated with salt.  Salt crystallizes and settles out, as fast as new salt arrives.  Another is to divert fresh water to it, so that it maintains a constant water level with minimal additional salt.  But minimal isn&#39;t the same as none.  And salt isn&#39;t the only thing that arrives.  It gets agricultural runoff, full of everything that gets sprayed on and everything that leaches from the soil and subsoil.<br><br>The answer that seems obvious to me is to bring in water, either ocean water or fresh water or some of each, but also to pump water out.  That water would be poured out on the ground not too far away, somewhere that&#39;s already a salt flat: an area that had salt water evaporate as an ancient, larger version of the Salton Sea dried up.  The salt flat would still be a salt flat, the Salton Sea would still be good habitat for a wide variety of birds, the organic pesticides would be broken down by exposure to sunlight, and the toxic elements leached from subsoil would be sequestered in the salty soil of the flat.", "comment_date": "2019-08-24T22:03:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Powers", "comment_text": "Lack of caring and lots of flies.", "comment_date": "2019-08-24T00:26:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omni UFO", "comment_text": ".,,I&#39;m speechless....got it 2 min later after finish...let out a loud why as you throw rocks at the sea...\ud83d\ude00", "comment_date": "2019-08-23T14:15:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Randy Randalman", "comment_text": "100 years ago humans could create lakes in the plains.

Population growth and diverted water sources have lowered its level, along with our cyclical drought.

Back in the fifties geologist told the state of California what they had to do to maintain the Salton Sea. The Geologist told the state that evetually the Salton Sea would would become too salt to be used by anyone, and they had a solution.  Large tracts on land would have to be used to produce industrial salt. The salt production would lose money, but it would maintain the Salton Sea&#39;s salt level at ocean&#39;s level of salt, but that would maintain a livable level of salt for fish, and people.  The geologist drew up plans, and had it all figured out.  There was a down side to the plan, the Salton area would lose maybe twenty five percent of prime real estate to salt production, but it would still leave seventy five percent of real estate for public use. The real estate industry went nuts. &quot;Twenty five pecent? That&#39;s crazy? When is this going to happen? Twenty years in  the future?&quot; They said. The real estate industry applied pressure, and plans to remove the salt from the Salton Sea was killed. So the twenty years have come an gone, and the real estate in the area is dead, and the Salton Sea is slowly dying. Why don&#39;t they do something now. The California real estate industry is very powerful, and they still have their hooks in the area, and they can &#39;t make money, but they don&#39;t want anyone else to make money either.", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T12:27:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fortune Finders", "comment_text": "Title should have been \u201cThis lake shouldn\u2019t exist\u201d", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T05:34:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bluesky", "comment_text": "ENTROPY, JUST GIVE IN TO ENTROPY, IT WILL ALL...

It&#39;s also a crucial habitat for a huge variety of migratory birds and a key stop within the Pacific Flyway. Humans have decimated almost all of the remaining wetland habitats throughout the state. We can save the Salton Sea, revive the region, and stop an impending health disaster by connecting sea to sea through Coyote Canal.&quot; - @Derrick Ruthless. Imagine what a tourist attraction a healthy Salton Sea could become if a canal big enough for riverboats and cruise ships was dug between the Gulf of Baja and the largest freshwater lake in California. Aside from tourism, the region has potential to become a renewable energy powerhouse and a real estate goldmine. The Imperial Valley is rich in wind, solar and geothermal resources. Floating solar panel power plants could slow the sea&#39;s evaporation rate. Integrated Pumped Hydropower Reverse Osmosis systems could use excess renewable energy to desalinate water and pump it up into mountain reservoirs. When power is needed, reservoir water is released to spin the pumps and their electric motors backwards to generate power. RO Brine could be discharged into evaporation ponds along the rapidly drying southern end of the sea for suppressing dust and cultivating brine shrimp for raising fish to restock the sea. This area is where 544 megawatts of geothermal power is already online and an estimated 2,000\r megawatts of geothermal energy awaits development. Warren Buffet&#39;s company may be in talks with Tesla about harvesting lithium from the geothermal brine. If the state and federal governments committed to such a plan, these investors would be more likely to get off the fence and pull the trigger on the projects they&#39;ve planned. Reimplementing the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) would provide meaningful work opportunities to unemployed and underemployed people and pay off dividends in the future.

There are indeed plenty of examples where human created &quot;ecosystems&quot; like this one that were created in a relatively short timescale (50 years is nothing on an ecological scale) indeed require constant human intervention to keep them that way. Without it, indeed chaos tends to arise and the ecosystem changes drastically. But this is also true for any &quot;natural&quot; ecosystem. There too, if you zoom in far enough, chaos seems to increase constantly. The sheer complexity of those ecosystems though, ensures that massive changes in one factor (species) are often countered by  changes in another species. The end result is that ecosystems in the sort term, because climatologic and geologic parameters change very slowly, tend to have its biological components gravitate towards a stable state (or equilibrium) that resists change. See Scheffer et all if you&#39;re interested. In the long term, those systems will change though and a real equilibrium doesn&#39;t exist in the way often portrayed in movies and documentaries as if all species are smart enough to adhere to certain  rules. In the sort term, enough biologic parameters in any system seem to ensure that the increasing chaos in one parameter are likely compensated by changes in other parameters. A lake like this, with very few species initially, and especially species that didn&#39;t belong there in the first place, will show enormous swings that will slowly subside until enough species are there to  create a sort of temporary stable state. If you look at the lake in a 100 years for instance, you might find a very interesting saltwater lake full of shrimp and flamingos and many migratory birds feeding on them. Or maybe a completely different ecosystem because of factors I can&#39;t even think off. If we keep moving the goal posts though, the system will keep changing rapidly, until some factor is able to counter the chaos we keep introducing in the system.", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T08:41:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pilgrim Dust", "comment_text": "Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse. / murphy&#39;s law /", "comment_date": "2018-01-18T23:02:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Squeaker Squad", "comment_text": "I thought he was going to talk about the \u201catomic lake\u201d in Russia.", "comment_date": "2018-01-18T12:11:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Photon Jones", "comment_text": "Largest surface area, NOT largest by volume", "comment_date": "2018-01-16T21:03:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel", "comment_text": "That is a false statement....It was the fact that humans intervened and created something that geographically shouldn&#39;t have existed that is now causing issues.

The reason is that the water is very polluted and thus the sand under the lake is very polluted. Agricultural runoff has been a major contributor to the pollution and increasing salinity of the sea and now it has created a serious health concern as the waters have receded. We already observe increased rates of asthma in adjacent areas. If the lake bed is allowed to be exposed, lots of contaminated soil is going to be blown all over populated areas. We have polluted the water, the polluted soil and now we have only one real solution. That solution is to refill the sea. The best option is likely to dig a canal from the Gulf of California to the Laguna Salada, West of Mexicali and then continue a canal or pipeline, across the US/Mexico border, to the Salton Sea. The best, but not surprisingly, the most costly option, would be simply letting the sea fill to sea level and allowing the in-flows and out-flows to reduce the salinity to match that of the Gulf of California. Trouble here is you&#39;d be flooding other populated areas and having to re-route or rebuild entire sections of I-8 and I-10 to cross the sea. You would reduce the pollutants over time as the water is exchanged with the Gulf of California. You&#39;d also have the option of an inland seaport if you build the canal wide enough and deep enough.<br><br>A more reasonable option might be to simply fill the lake with the same canal/pipeline solution, but keep it low enough to simply cover the polluted lakebed that has already been exposed. This has the drawback though, of not reducing the salinity much and leaving no avenue of escape for the polluted water.<br>Or, you could build a pipeline over the Peninsular Ranges east of Carlsbad. You&#39;d only have to pump the water to the top and let gravity carry the rest over down to the Salton Sea. You no longer have to negotiate with Mexico to do this, but the same drawbacks apply. The water doesn&#39;t have anywhere to go, the salinity won&#39;t drop much over time and the pollutants stay.", "comment_date": "2017-06-02T18:20:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Stubb", "comment_text": "California has a lake it doesnt know what to do with AND a water shortage....", "comment_date": "2017-06-01T16:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sinaduel", "comment_text": "so fill it up?", "comment_date": "2017-05-31T21:09:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Malith Trevo", "comment_text": "hey I was just wondering if there is a way to get the salt content down....

Thats why 60% of the internet ignorantly beleive that furries are people who rape animals or something else negative when in reality, furries are just people who are fasinated by anthropomorphic animals. Remember, that kind of thinking, that kind of listening and not trying to validate by observing and asking and being curious to see if its true has caused lots of bad things to happen. Take for example the nazis using the jews as a scapegoat for all their problems or when black people were lynched because they beleived that black people where inferior to them when in fact jews and black people have invented and made brilliant theories like the general theory of relativity or the exo-suit a black person invented that allowed people to go into envirements they normally wouldnt be able to(where there were lots of smoke like in a building on fire). If you look closely, you can find many misconceptions that many people make that are just wrong and harm other groups of people.

You could say a star going supernova is messy.  The supernova could destroy whole planets that could harbor life, but that supernova could also after millions of years end up producing planets or spreading elements to other planets in other solar systems that could produce new life.  The Salton Sea should be left to nature to decide, not man.  You mention there was a lake there in the past, but you gloss over the fact that it disappeared naturally.  My best guess is that the old lake vanished for many of the reasons the current one is vanishing (minus the fact that our agriculture runoff most likely sped up the process ten fold).  Letting the Salton Sea return to a natural state could benefit the area in ways that mankind couldn&#39;t even possibly imagine.  The salt, animal decay and other natural process in several thousand years could end up feeding a new life or even a new civilization, one that wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t exist if we try to &quot;fix&quot; things now. - Whoa... after rereading my comment I was suddenly struck by the PRIME DIRECTIVE of star trek.  So to summarize my comment, in the words of the wise Jean-Luc Picard &quot;History has proven again and again that whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilization, no matter how well intentioned that interference may be, the results are invariably disastrous.&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-02-09T06:50:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Sico", "comment_text": "zzzz\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4e\u270a\u270c\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\u2764\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc63\ud83d\udc43\ud83d\udc43\ud83d\udc42\ud83d\udc40\u270b\ud83d\udc4a\u261d\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc50\u270c\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9f\ud83d\udc4d;-) :-( :-) O:-) \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf87\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf80\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd5\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udd14", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T20:30:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KillaSin515", "comment_text": "Sandy Shores GTA", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T01:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ford Frank", "comment_text": "is that sandy shores?", "comment_date": "2016-02-07T20:33:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skeptica Lexicon", "comment_text": "Nature has its own order even if you cant see it.

He said that in the absence of our care, things tend to &quot;naturally fall apart&quot;. But I personally want to say that the aftermath of the Salton Sea area isn&#39;t necessarily a result of the predictable occurrence of things just falling apart, but our failure to look after our man-made creations, as well as our neglect, in the case of agricultural run off elevating the salt levels of the water. But I guess you can counter this by saying that, well, there is no ability for outflow to control for rising levels of salinity (since the lake is naturally already in an area of fairly low elevation). Additionally,  Derek did stress the point that things tend to fall apart due to our absence of effort and caring. I guess my only qualm would be his mentioning that everything naturally gives way to decay without us - in which case I want to answer with, &quot;Yes, but only because you&#39;re talking about man made creations that don&#39;t have any business being there if it weren&#39;t for our intervention&quot;. The only example I can think of that goes against this (everything naturally falls apart) is the evolution of life as a result of natural selection and favorable planetary conditions. But maybe that&#39;s just luck, since I&#39;ve read that the universe is slowly approaching a heat death when there will no longer be any transfer of energy available.

Now that we have nationalized the redwood forests it is our policy to stamp out any wildfires in order to &quot;protect&quot; the trees. But since then small trees and other plants have flourished which now compete with the redwoods for space and water which in the end hurts their growth.

People forget that we too are of this earth and we can&#39;t do anything unnatural because we are natural citizens of this place. Like Derek said, this lake has come and gone many times, and we created it by accident just once out of alot of times, we were simply the driving force that triggered it that century to form. But also by caring too much we can be destructive, for instance the terrible drought in Cali today, so many dams and resevoirs were blocked to protect wildlife and because of that we&#39;ve messed up the salinity of alot of deltas. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t be so introspective of our actions and simply let them play out to our advantage and the other inhabitants of this planet will play their cards to follow. We cant save ever fish, every snail and every bird, so trying to save species that are cuter doesn&#39;t negate our impact on the ecosystem of the world. There are hundreds of species that disapear every day on this earth, species that are unique to one small hole in the ground, or one bend in a river for which there is only one representative of their kind, and then it dies. That&#39;s just the way it is. I think my point is, there are alot of things we should feel morally culpable for, but we are a species of mammals on this earth and we have a great deal of influence on it. The only way to make ourselves invisible to the ecosystem is for us all to die, so we need to accept our place, and realize that some things just aren&#39;t moral questions and sometimes we only contribute to a small part of the problem.", "comment_date": "2015-07-06T17:40:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u3042\u30fc\u3055\u30fc", "comment_text": "That fly totally caught my eye lol", "comment_date": "2015-07-06T17:40:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "West KGR", "comment_text": "the last couple of videos have been so philysophical and its really strange.. like it shows how we are helpess because we think we are helpless...... oh no its catching on!", "comment_date": "2015-07-06T17:39:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HejManden", "comment_text": "no", "comment_date": "2015-07-06T17:38:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremiah McElroy", "comment_text": "I love you videos!
