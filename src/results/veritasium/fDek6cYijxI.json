The flapping of a butterfly wing in Brazil has never caused a tornado in Texas or anywhere else. <br><br>It is used to explain contradictions in logic of scale allowing insignificant factors to be attributed major effects. This would be magical thinking and is used to overcome basic contradictions in logic when false dialogues are being introduced. <br><br>In particular use has been to support climate change narrative where trace element gasses are given fantastical properties in order to further an agenda (Agenda21) along with dubious terms such as tipping points. <br><br>For example:<br>Carbon dioxide at 0.04% is a 2,500th part of the atmosphere. that means to warm the climate by just 1&quot;c carbon dioxide molecules must capture 2,500&quot;c of heat energy.

If you perform many times the same experiment under the same circumstances, for measuring the value for one physic constant, you will realize that every time you are performing the experiment the value will be slightly different from the previous time, and then you are forced to do a graphics of the results and to act with logarithms then after to have the constant value as we know it. The simple example of uncertainty is the \u03c0 value. This uncertainty is because of the unstopped material motion and in atoms is greater because the speed of the motions are greatest. The uncertainty rules, as Daskalalis proved that Nash equations hasn&#39;t solutions, which means that the future is unpredictable over time. For that reason, and because all systems are open, they have chaotic behavior. But this does not mean that the motion of matter isn&#39;t under law, or that the result of this motion in any time isn&#39;t material and that could mean that we live in a Matrix! Even uncertainty is a repetitive  behavior which mean it is a law.", "comment_date": "2022-04-04T19:30:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "K Mully", "comment_text": "If a butterfly could create a tsunami, then why not a &#39;randomly moving&#39;  atom?", "comment_date": "2022-04-04T09:43:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "julius", "comment_text": "why is science so blah if it wasnt so bland it woukd be super epic creatioN!!! 100   epic", "comment_date": "2022-04-03T20:08:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hema", "comment_text": "Having a bad math teacher at very young age, has the butterfly effect on the rest of your life; for example\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T16:15:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Maxwell", "comment_text": "Oh, the memes", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T23:15:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cat does programming", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&amp;t=0m27s\">0:27</a><br>I take the responsibility to make the other 8", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T16:41:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pure Spirit Guided", "comment_text": "I think the real question that people wonder is, &#39;Do our actions really matter?&#39; versus predicting the future.", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T04:30:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chase Mott", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&amp;t=1m55s\">1:55</a> what\u2019s the location of this photo that\u2019s used.

After around two years of this, I finally did it.  At the time, I was planning to write a swam simulation in Haskell.  He gave me some interesting advice.  He suggested I not worry about state.  Normally, in simulations like this, one would use a buffering technique, so that the state currently being generated is based purely on the previous state.  If you don&#39;t do this, early changes can affect later changes, blurring state between frames.  I took this advice to mean that I shouldn&#39;t concern myself with this, so I wrote a simulation that advances each particle based on wherever the others happen to be _at this moment_, instead of buffering state.  The result was that behavior of the simulation was far more organic, lacking artificial looking patterns that tended to show up in the state buffered simulations I had previously written.<br><br>This isn&#39;t the <i>really</i> interesting part though.  Another thing I did to achieve this indeterminate state was to based advancement on time passed, rather than progressing a set amount per &quot;frame&quot;.  Frames really only made sense when trying to preserve state integrity, and since I wasn&#39;t doing that, I fell back to an older method I used to use when writing video games.<br><br>So, here is how the simulation worked: I started with a list of particles.  During each loop, I would advance the first particle in the list, based on the amount of time passed since I had last advanced that particle (and based on the positions of the other particles in the list).  Then I would move that particle to the end of the list.  (Using functional programming techniques in Haskell make this extremely easy.)  This completely abandoned state integrity, which did manage to achieve very interesting results.<br><br>The <i>most</i> interesting result, however, was what happened with, on a whim, I ran two identical instances of the simulation side-by-side.  Starting them at exactly the same time randomly placed the particles in the same places.  To be clear, this is the <i>only</i> place in the simulation where randomness was used, and because the RNG was seeded based on system time, starting them simultaneously seeded them identically.  So, they started with particles in exactly the same positions, and the particles then started moving in exactly the same patterns.  Except, imagine my surprise when I noticed the simulations begin to deviate.  They started in identical states.  There was no additional randomness going into the simulations.  So they should have matched perfectly.<br><br>That final assessment, however, was actually wrong.  There <i>was</i> still some <i>tiny</i> amount of randomness going in.  This randomness was processor scheduling.  The difference between the two simulations was the <i>time</i> passing between iterations.  Desktop operating systems assign processor cycles to programs using some algorithm.  How cycles are assigned depends on a lot of factors, including how many processes are waiting for CPU time, the priority level of those processors, how much input and output is being generated, and so on.  This means that even running the same program twice, at the same time, won&#39;t give them identical schedules.  Anyhow, in the context of the simulation, this means that while each particle started in exactly the same state as its parallel in the other instance, it <i>didn&#39;t</i> always take exactly the same amount of time between iterations, and this allowed tiny differences due to floating point error to work their way in.  But, modern processors are extremely fast, so the actual differences in time were infinitesimal, barely big enough to make any difference in the floating point time values being generated, and further, the floating point error created by these slight difference were also infinitesimal.  So how, after only a few seconds, could deviation be seen?<br><br>The answer is chaos theory.  One might be tempted to suggest that the tiny differences would add up to big ones, but the truth is, the tiny difference <i>should be expected</i> to just average out.  If we are basing progression on time, the differences <i>do</i> average out.  The cumulative time that has been applied to any particle will always be within a few milliseconds of the total time passed since starting the program.  And floating point error doesn&#39;t tend more toward one direction than another, so over many iterations that will also average out.<br><br>So what was actually happening was that tiny differences (perhaps on a scale closer to quantum than macroscopic) produced from effectively random influences were having the impact of chaos.  Maybe an easier way to think of this is considering each iteration as a &quot;starting condition&quot; for all future iterations.  So, the first iteration has some infinitesimal difference between the two simulations.  That difference, while initially imperceptible, results in growing deviation between the simulations.  And this happens _on every iteration_.<br><br>Now, this might seem like some merely interesting theoretical stuff, but it&#39;s far more than that.  What degree of impact does quantum randomness have on the macroscopic world?  It&#39;s easy to write it off as having literally no impact, except when we are deliberately measuring quantum effects and acting based on them.  Chaos theory suggests otherwise though, and my simulation demonstrates exactly how even infinitesimal differences being added into the system on a constant basis can have a significant impact in even a fairly short period of time.<br><br>So the truth is, not only would the future be unpredictable even if it was 100% deterministic, due to chaos, our universe <i>isn&#39;t</i> 100% deterministic, because the various sources of quantum randomness are constantly injecting random new information into the universe, and this means that even if we could know the initial conditions with infinite accuracy and precision, we <i>still</i> couldn&#39;t predict the future, because tiny state changes are constantly filtering in, and those are injecting new tiny differences that chaos will eventually amplify into enormous differences.", "comment_date": "2021-10-29T10:19:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mike Dang", "comment_text": "Rounding Errors", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T12:13:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GOURAB PATRA", "comment_text": "what if we mark, a starting point of prediction and also each probable footprint, then can&#39;t we just follow up the process forwards or backwards to foresee the future or rewind to the past.<br>wait<br>is that even possible ?", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T06:21:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kushal Dev Kashyap", "comment_text": "@Derek - Infinite loop in a finite space seems similar to the uncertainity principle where in if you try to super enlarge the position graph you will see chaos/uncertainity in other factors like velocity and momentum.<br>Let me know if this makes sense.", "comment_date": "2021-10-26T16:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiden Kim", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&amp;t=1m54s\">1:54</a> is that cause you could see the atoms interact and know what action they will cause", "comment_date": "2021-10-25T23:24:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cleo Young", "comment_text": "did veritasium ever do that video about magic the gathering that I think is mentioned in this video?", "comment_date": "2021-10-24T03:54:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Builder 101", "comment_text": "Praise the Lord that he designed chaos in such a way that it provides seemingly randomness in the universe!", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T01:24:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fil\u00f3 Bi\u00f3", "comment_text": "Thanks for call the Brazil", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T16:46:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Merilix2", "comment_text": "The name butterfly effect indeed refers to the shape of the Lorenz attractor.<br><br>I remember several years ago, a weather forecaster in tv sayd he cant predict the weather properly because the system actually was very chaotic.

In nature there are a lot more variables you might consider but a system will be robust to changes in a lot of them.

I always assumed it has been more or less the same for billions of years, at least the orbit of the Earth must have be very close to the same during all that time.<br>2) For me, the image of the butterfly effect has always been somewhat misleading. Sure, in theory a butterfly could totally change the outcome somewhere far away. But in reality, there are billions of butterflys flapping their wings, and billions more of other creatures and objects causing disturbances of all kinds. With all that background &quot;noise&quot;, it is hard to image that any of those major events could be traced back to any given butterfly, unless very close by in space and time. And even if one could prove that a butterfly caused an avalanche to go off 10000 miles away, had that one particular butterfly sat still, another one would have caused the avalanche a microsecond later. In other words, don&#39;t blame the butterfly for catastrophes, the problem is with the condition that made the situation so instable in the first place.", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T01:30:08Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "George Kozi", "comment_text": "You said something at the 9 minute mark and my ears perked up.

A week is a long time for the weather, but for space it&#39;s nothing.<br><br>And along with that, weather models are never &quot;correct&quot;. Their predictions may match what ends up occurring in some areas, but they can never be perfect. Even though meteorologists have moved away from doing hardcore math to make predictions because computers have allowed for more predictions to be made much more quickly, they still need humans to interpret them and to determine whether or not the outcome is realistic. This is why weather apps on your phone (The Weather Channel, etc.) are often wrong, because they&#39;re pretty much purely model output with no human interpretation. Also, ensemble runs (multiple runs often at a lower resolution to save time computing) are very useful with portraying uncertainty in a forecast and deterministic runs (single runs at a higher resolution) will likely be more accurate than any single run in the ensemble members.

If you were to put sensors every 1/2 mile, the space between would be a mystery and so forth down and down the scale. That proved that no matter how much you tried to &quot;map&quot; a chaotic system, the space in between the measurements will throw you off over time.

On a large scale, it is, cause everything is predicted by classical mechanics. On a small scale, things might not be so simple, and based on probability. But that wouldn&#39;t matter cause it&#39;s small scale right? Then I thought well what if two scientists made a bet on the result of a quantum phenomenon that, to the best of our knowledge, is based on probability rather than being deterministic? Assuming this phenomenon has two possible results, there are now two possible futures. One where scientist A wins and one where scientist B wins. These two would be drastically different due to the butterfly effect, and if we had Laplace&#39;s demon, we could predict the future of both but we wouldn&#39;t know which one is going to happen. So I came to the conclusion that the universe is only deterministic if intelligent life does not observe quantum phenomena. Then I thought, is quantum phenomena really probability based, or is it actually determined by set formulae and we just don&#39;t understand it yet? If it really is a case of the quantum realm being based on probability, then would the act of time travel itself change the future? Assuming you travel back in time and do nothing, interact with no one and nothing physical at all, would you still inevitably change the future because you are &#39;re-rolling the dice&#39; on all the quantum phenomena that occurred in the future? I think it is interesting and that if we could time travel then we could determine whether or not it is deterministic or chance-based, but unfortunately we can&#39;t go back in time so we might not ever know unless our understanding develops to the point where we understand everything in the universe.", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T03:31:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamanashis Roy", "comment_text": "Can sending rockets to sky kick the planet out of the solar system ?", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T00:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zeko Ministar", "comment_text": "Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?

Left Hemisphere is responsible for control of the right side of the body, and is the more academic and logical side of the brain. They control to each other. If vaccines damage any part of brain it will trigger health issues. Why? Because they control to each other but when the damage is caused one or more parts of brain can NOT control the other ones. Reason why people still believe in vaccines is because we have been learned to actually believe in vaccines system. And also Lorenz said : &quot;Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation, can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general.&quot; What means in translate - if brain is damaged early when human is born nobody will see a major difference soon.

Take for example a busy restaurant, the waiters and waitresses are rushing  serving customers, then business slows down and the restaurant starts letting the wait staff clock out, if they send 3 wait staff home, then business gets busy again, depending on the time of day or busy cycles, and how soon after business slowed down the wait staff was sent home,there is a relational and calculate able formula that can be discovered with careful observation, perhaps this formula can be used with chaos to correctly predict future events, I mentioned a threshold with the cause effect loop, it is possible that by carefully doing actions at precise times that are a result of the cause that the threshold can be overcome which allows you full control of that particular cause and effect loop. It really is hard to believe, but try observing a business in action paying close attention to the causes and the effects they create, it&#39;s even better if you work at a place cause then you can observe the intricate actions.", "comment_date": "2019-12-13T14:39:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Legend of the Stormlord", "comment_text": "I conceived of such an effect when I was just a kid.

Perhaps that ant happened to be the one that was going to find a major food source for the nest and leave its trail.  And the pebble scared a frog and made him go a different way and he coincidentally found a fly and ate it because he moved a different way.  Then, from these small changes, there is a cascading effect that gets bigger and bigger with time.  Eventually, one of those tiny choices would become SO amplified that the date at which life on Earth ceases to exist can be affected or humans could become extinct sooner, or later, or go from never being able to colonize another planet to BEING able.

The unpredictable nature of a chaotic system is fundamentally a question of precision and, as you point out, it does not destroy the deterministic nature of a system.  The future of a chaotic system is absolutely determined by its present conditions and if you could, in fact, know the state of a system with absolute precision, the future state could also be known.  The implications of chaos are much more about the limit of our own knowledge as mere mortals and its implications on our ability to predict the future and understand the patterns the may evolve given those limits.  It has very practical consequences, but understanding chaos just made us better understand the implications of limited knowledge on even slightly complex system.  Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, changed our fundamental understanding of the nature of reality and sounded the true death knell of determinism.  While QM helps us understand the probability of certain futures, to put it simply, it is fundamentally non-deterministic and relies an pure probability without certainty.  To get a little philosophical, science, at it&#39;s core, emerges from our observed existence in which we find that modeling our experiences of reality allows us to build an understanding of that reality most notably marked by our ability to make and test predictions using those models.  The system of science then refines or replaces those models as dictated by our experiences and the ability of the model to accurately predict those experiences.  Yet in QM -- at our deepest understanding of our reality as derived from science -- the model itself requires true, pure unpredictably for an accurate description of the reality we experience.  So science, which relies on our ability to build and refine models graded by their power to predict our perceived reality, has led us to a model that demands pure unpredictability as a core tenet of that reality.

Its a binary state. either you DO or you DONT.<br>The X value could be -100. you walk by the candy bar without thinking of it.<br>The X value could be -25.   you consider the candy but walk past.<br>The X value could be -1.     you put the candy in your cart, but at checkout you decide not to buy it.<br>the X value could be +1.     you put the candy in your cart. but at checkout you didnt want to just leave it in a random spot. so you buy it instead of putting it back.<br>the X value could be +100. you went to the store specifically for the candy and nothing else.<br><br>If you put the half way point between both attracters in the butterfly example at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&amp;t=6m58s\">6:58</a> (x=0) then any value less than X=0 WILL go left.<br><br>The system of the universe is NOT unpredictable. we lack the means to model it.", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T19:17:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Ming", "comment_text": "Why do I think I am watching Steins;Gate explain video", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T19:16:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Tong", "comment_text": "Dota 2", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T19:15:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "maxcap60", "comment_text": "Who Is Hari Seldon?", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T19:15:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ronnie Record", "comment_text": "An excellent brief clear introduction and visual representation of some of the concepts behind Chaos Theory.

Somewhat helped comprehend how setting a goal and aligning with the most effective, efficient influential factors, being readily responsible to respond to change... can influence in a sense, creating your own reality. <br><br><br>Just as much as that felt rather pleasant to consider... so did the thought of randomizing my activities and my inputs, say, to the events I directly influence on this path of more or less predetermined &#39;things along the way&#39; which I would experience in the future as a result of what I consciously (and subconsciously) directly (and indirectly) influence. And maybe there is some power there, just as too, to set a goal and go for it, but also to not, to rather mix things up instead, do what you deem as random, out of the norm, out of the box, out of the comfort zone - probably fair to say that if you don&#39;t have a goal set up, then maybe you have not yet come across something that absolutely sparks your passion drive (which we likely have in all of us, many factors external having influence too no doubt). And in that realm of unknowns and unexpected, something might just trigger the butterfly effect which brings into your reality he awareness of how amazing (really amazing) the concept of life, awareness, being - for all of us together - actually is... Or maybe that&#39;s a bit of a stretch :D And where you think your current actions and approach are not on some path, maybe its just the path to finding the (other) path... or maybe you think you are and the goal is clear, however, that is just one path of many others to a goal you aren&#39;t yet aware of... or there is no such thing as a path ahead, and just... a here... and now.

The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.&quot;   -  <a href=\"https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2164-0947.1963.tb01464.x\">https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2164-0947.1963.tb01464.x</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:08:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MegaAadhar", "comment_text": "so basically, this is the summary of 1st Chapter of Steven Strogatz&#39;s famous book: Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:06:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "flame games", "comment_text": "Wow you called that a meme", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:06:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KillerGB 420", "comment_text": "anyone else notice the sigma letter disappears for a second between <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&amp;t=1m53s\">1:53</a>  ?", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:05:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fuzz Labrador", "comment_text": "blackboards<br>    sandiness<br>    posturing<br>    wheedling<br>    spoliation<br>    friending<br>    altruism<br>    lodestone<br>    generator<br>    en wheeled<br>    diastase<br>    neutralized<br>    epitomizes<br>    validness<br>    non unique<br>    glimmered<br>    disarrays<br>    continuos<br>    discloser<br>    tomograms<br>    erosional<br>    vehemence<br>    supermoms<br>    affixable<br>    subclaims<br>    silkworms<br>    underload<br>    rejecters<br>    outsmells<br>    mandrills<br>    poeticize<br>    careers<br>    geometric<br>    nominates<br>    cheverons<br>    galvanise<br>    saintlier<br>    toileting<br>    fraudster<br>    primavera<br>    zymolysis<br>    bookstore<br>    sexualize<br>    rhyolitic<br>    dynatrons<br>    squalenes<br>    uncoupler<br>    appliable<br>    anacrusis<br>    softwares", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:05:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Puchi Simida", "comment_text": "thanks for the PBS special", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:03:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noah Lenz", "comment_text": "This is litterally my entire foucs for my physics thesis, very good video.", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:03:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheSupriest", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map</a><br><br>Logistic map bifurcation diagram:<br><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logistic_Map_Bifurcation_Diagram,_Matplotlib.svg#/media/File:Logistic_Map_Bifurcation_Diagram,_Matplotlib.svg\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logistic_Map_Bifurcation_Diagram,_Matplotlib.svg#/media/File:Logistic_Map_Bifurcation_Diagram,_Matplotlib.svg</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luka Ivankovi\u0107", "comment_text": "Geniues", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:02:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Breadstick", "comment_text": "Jeff Goldblum as Dr Ian Malcolm: &quot;That&#39;s aaaahhhh... chaos theory.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:01:47Z", "likes_count": 39}, {"comment_by": "John Wilson", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvHMhZ1T964\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvHMhZ1T964</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:01:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FaithOfficialPS3", "comment_text": "OOOOH FOR THIS LIFE I CANNOT CHANGE", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:00:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Franco maccaroni", "comment_text": "just excellent", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T00:00:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jabozanator", "comment_text": "Its like vsauce but serious.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T23:59:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fortune Morota", "comment_text": "This is awesomely nostalgic.

In order to control the development of a society you would have to be able to predict how the society would react to any given action you might take, and such predictions have generally proven to be highly unreliable. Human societies are complex systems-technologically advanced societies are most decidedly complex-and prediction of the behavior of complex systems presents difficulties that are not contingent on the present state of our knowledge or our level of technological development.<br><br>Unintended consequences are a well-known problem with the design and use of technology. The cause of many unintended consequences seems clear: The systems involved are complex, involving interaction among and feedback between many parts. Any changes to such a system will cascade in ways that are difficult to predict; this is especially true when human actions are involved.<br><br>Problems in economics can give us some idea of how impossibly difficult it would be to predict or control the behavior of a system as complex as that of a modern human society. It is convincingly argued that a modern economy can never be rationally planned to maximize efficiency, because the task of carrying out such planning would be too overwhelmingly complex. Calculation of a rational system of prices for the U.S. economy alone would require manipulation of a conservatively estimated 6xl013 (sixty trillion!) simultaneous equations. That takes into account only the economic factors involved in establishing prices and leaves out the innumerable psychological, sociological, political, etc., factors that continuously interact with the economy. <br><br>Even if we make the wildly improbable assumption that the behavior of our society could be predicted through the manipulation of, say, a million trillion simultaneous equations and that sufficient computing power to conduct such manipulation were available, collection of the data necessary for insertion of the appropriate numbers into the equations would be impracticable, especially since the data would have to meet impossibly high standards of precision if the predictions were expected to remain valid over any considerable interval of time. Edward Lorenz, a meteorologist, was the first to call widespread attention to the fact that even the most minute inaccuracy in the data provided can totally invalidate a prediction about the behavior of a complex system. This fact came to be called the &quot;butterfly effect&quot; because in 1972, at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Lorenz gave a talk that he titled &quot;Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly&#39;s Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?&quot; Lorenz&#39;s work is said to have been the inspiration for the development of what is called &quot;chaos theory&quot; -the butterfly effect being an example of &quot;chaotic&quot; behavior.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T20:14:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "realcygnus", "comment_text": "Good one.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T20:13:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gumbydude ", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&amp;t=8m32s\">8:32</a> how true is this?

I even published a paper using it :) I love the Lorenz 63 model and all my work is first tested on it, just to see how viable it is!<br><br>This video is being sent straight to my mum so she can know a little more about what I did haha :D", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T19:38:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mdame", "comment_text": "that&#39;s deep", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T19:37:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramon Almodovar", "comment_text": "i even have a tattoo because of the chaos theory ..", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T19:37:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OTHMAN", "comment_text": "\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 :&quot;\u064a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0638\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0629\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0651\u064f\u0646\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0622\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u063a\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T19:37:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Junaid Farooqui", "comment_text": "In Europe, during a major conflict, a British soldier spared the life of a German counterpart, who was also reject by an arts academy, which probably caused rapid advancement of science in mid-20th century, making the world as it is today!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T19:37:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sokratis Kourtsidis", "comment_text": "So it is actually the Van Gogh&#39;s effect...
