This is the result of extremely high drag. If you were to conduct this ball test from a very high point where the acceleration is allowed to build, air resistance will build as velocity increases and the difference in mass will soon be impacted by drag as this force increases and the heavier ball will accelerate longer.

A heavier ball will always fall slightly faster although not measurable by any means. In regular atmosphere, some of this can be attributed to terminal velocity, but a heavier ball will always fall faster even in a vacuum. This effect is derived from Newton&#39;s second and third law of motion. This classical physics problem can be modeled. Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation gives the equation Between the gravitational force between two objects with mass in relation to their masses and distance of separation. Since force is also modeled by force=mass*acceleration, you can equate the two equations. Mass of object cancels out leaving acceleration right? So all objects will fall at an accelerating rate of 9.8 m/s/s right? Wrong. This neglects the acceleration of the earth to the object. Newton&#39;s third law states that the object will also exert an equal force on the earth, so the earth will also accelerate towards the ball, leaving a smaller distance between them per time unit, which ultimately repeats itself but this time by the distance being smaller, so the gravitational force being larger and thus the acceleration being larger.
