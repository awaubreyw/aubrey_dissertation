When the Ultrasonic transducer was aimed at the rubber corner, the milligram \u201cforce\u201d created by the ultrasonic sound pressure (deflected at 45 degrees) was proportional to the milliwatts of ultrasonic energy emitted through the water.

One of my friends came up with a recipe for starting solid rocket engines, which used a mix of smokeless powder, aluminium powder, potassium chlorate, and other dopants depending on his needs for the rocket at hand. When he was done making this concoction he&#39;d coat a tiny section of unjacketed ignition wire with it while it&#39;s dissolved in acetone, then once that dried hard again, he&#39;d coat it in several layers of ping pong ball dissolved in acetone as well. Competition ping pong balls are actually made using 100% nitrocellulose, which is the same active component of flash paper (just tissue paper dipped in nitric acid and dried), and also a significant component of smokeless powder along with nitroglycerine. He claims that if he doesn&#39;t coat it in nitrocellulose, the starter may detonate sometimes, but it&#39;s very inconsistent, so coating it in hard nitrocellulose keeps the pressure in long enough to ensure detonation 100% of the time. his rockets were pretty fantastic performance wise so I trust his knowledge. Pretty sure this is just a common thing home made rocket enthusiasts use since i&#39;ve seen videos demonstrating similar techniques here on youtube with various recpies", "comment_date": "2022-05-21T05:58:16Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Thomas James Stone III", "comment_text": "Bro, 1: your seat is too high for trials; 2: your tire is flat.", "comment_date": "2022-05-10T13:46:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yacoub Ohan", "comment_text": "Is the camera taking the picture on the image back on the garage door or is it put behind the razorblade?", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T08:38:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chanchal Sharma", "comment_text": "Can I please get written documentation of the procedure you used to build up this setup?

You&#39;d need a microscopic version of the Schlieren to see some sounds and a much larger version to see others (not to mention you&#39;d need considerable resolution), and seeing a shockwave isn&#39;t really the same thing since it&#39;s such an extreme case that it&#39;s not just a sound, it&#39;s an explosion moving faster than the compression/rarefaction rate of the air. (Also, shockwaves aren&#39;t that cool in this way since you can see them with the naked eye.) To visualize the sound of the human voice, for example, I&#39;d expect you need a surface of at least 6meters for your lens, since the wavelength of the human voice is roughly ~1.6m at the small end of things, you&#39;d want enough space to see a full compression and rarefaction of the air. <br><br>Experiment Proposal: Get a tone generator and figure out a good possible wavelength to match the size of your current setup. I&#39;d expect the sound to be pretty high pitched. Crank the volume as high as absolutely possible.

This is a balanced set of primary colors. I&#39;d LOVE to see if it makes an improvement or change of any kind. <br><br>Here&#39;s a lengthy explanation. Red, green, and blue are the primaries used in most digital displays. RGB is in &quot;rainbow order&quot; (ROYGBIV) but, CMY is not. That&#39;s because the CMY colors are in order relative to the RGBs. Cyan is like anti-red, magenta like anti-green, and yellow like anti-blue. Shine red, green, and blue filtered light on the same spot and you will produce white light: remove just the red and it becomes cyan; remove only green and the spot becomes magenta; remove only the blue and it becomes yellow. <br><br>You can think of Red-Cyan, Green-Magenta, and Blue-Yellow as supplementary lights because each individual pair combines to make white light. Pairing supplementary filters or a light with its supplementary filter should produce a colorless &quot;shadow&quot;. This is how projectors used to work. They had three lamps and three filters to produce three shadow images. Rear projection TVs utilized the same type of projection system. They combined a red shadow, green shadow, and blue shadow to produce one color image. In theory, the same could be done with RGB filters for Schlieren imaging but, the result would be much dimmer than CMY filters. A comparison would certainly be interesting. <br><br>The red, green, and blue primaries probably came about as a result of Newtons study of optics. CMYK is common in print media and, given the ordering of the letters, probably came about for that reason and ironically after color TV. This irony is because the idea of painting primaries probably dates back to the Italian Renaissance but, the primaries are most commonly taught in grade school as RYB, which is problematic. Yet, painters experimented with different palettes long before TV and even before Sir Isaac. They were most likely aware that cyan and magenta could be used to create colors that would be impossible without them. <br><br>Please feel free to correct any mistakes with experimentation and/or research. <br><br>Fun Fact for the Kiddos:<br>Did you know that computer screens used to be monochromatic with black and white (Macintosh), green and black (anything older), or red and black (rare old model calculators)... even when TV was in color?<br><br>(Dear e-ink, you&#39;ve been using the wrong primaries for your solid state displays for years. That&#39;s why the technology hasn&#39;t taken off... because you need CMY pigments and can&#39;t produce enough colors as a consequence. Convert from RGB encoding should be a cake walk. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong and you corrected this problem already. Or maybe you just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re shooting for with your primaries. I can explain. The world might see a quantum shift in tech again if you sort out your materials.

Now if the shutter speed is not fast enough, the traveling waves will smear and the contrast will fall. But there might be a way around that one: use stroboscopic light source instead of the shutter speed to get close to the speaker frequency. In this way you can integrate longer without losing contrast. You need 1 arduino, one speaker and 2 transistors (one for your flashlight, one for the speaker).<br>Standing waves would also work.
