Those of us who are inventors with some degree of abstract thought for example, can conceptualize the requirement for thermal stratification in a heat exchanger to counteract the short circuit otherwise developed from use of low thermal conductivity materials. However, it&#39;s not the same as working in a dark room and knowing you have cut off all the visible light or of putting a draft stop at the bottom of a closed door because of feeling cold air on your feet. Our inventions are constrained by our environment and our shuttered perception of it. We are very lucky to be able to conceptualize past this into that we don&#39;t feel or see.

Dont forget that despite the struggles and madness in this world today, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be<br>destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>Christ says in John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have\u00a0[perfect]\u00a0peace. In the world you have tribulation\u00a0and\u00a0distress\u00a0and\u00a0suffering, but be courageous\u00a0[be confident, be undaunted, be filled with joy];\u00a0I have overcome the world.\u201d\u00a0[My conquest is accomplished, My victory abiding.]<br>-\u00a0 (AMPLIFIED version) <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus.

I came across an old study on line a while back done by the bureau of weights and measures in a 1932 publication of theirs. It was highly sophisticated for the time and included all the data they collected. I think the title was &quot; an investigation into the measuring of extreme ultraviolet solar radiation to reach the planets surface. In the report they claim that one day smoke from a nearby forest fire had drifted over their measuring instruments and that the extreme u/v more then doubled in intensity.  They at first were baffled but later discovered what had happened was that instead of the occasional ray to reach the surface of the planet the smoke allowed the extream portion of the u/v to i think the word used was defuse but i am probably wrong .it allowed the u/v to scatter which made the whole sky become the source of U/v instead of the ray . Later i thought it must be the same phenomenon that allows people to get sun burned in the fog. So if this is correct would the intentional blocking of sunlight by scientist by injecting especially water vapor  into the atmosphere actually harmful to living organisms?  They do this often in California and i have plenty of evidence that they do. One more thing that your video touched upon was the u/v and the flowers. Bee&#39;s see in the u/v and they have been losing bee colonies rapidly. Is it possible that increased U/v could be responsible for their plight ?

When you have these filters <a href=\"http://removed.you/\">removed.you</a> have an &#39;All spectrum Camera&#39;. There are things you will see that are just incredible.     It&#39;s like night vision, you look through night vision equipment there is no doubt that what you are seeing is real. What ever you see with night vision would surely be there even if you didn&#39;t have the camera.  Now, much of the stuff seen with UV and IR equipment is beyond weird. Cartoonist figures in the clouds. Foliage in particular at night near the bank of a meandering brook. Cars that appear in physical light to be doing car stuff like parking or driving; meanwhile in the UV range parts of them are folding up, in impossible ways.... They are re configuring into flying machines. Turn your back for a second and they are gone. Then focus on the Cessna 172 above you. It sounds like a Cessna, looks like a Cessna plane So you zoom out and manage to catch it in the middle of the frame and what do you have ? A small ball of plasma is all that was seen by your special camera. Yes, there are enough phenomena that I think it&#39;s clear that the Aliens are here and that there are all sort of new technologies In use. Both IR and UV are used in automatic guiding and landing systems.. In past centuries a camouflaged flyer would have been guarded by &#39;the elves&#39; the people of the forest, by the trees themselves. The  parking area would be avoided as an evil spot with restless spirits. The vehicle operator ,could have just as easily been a member of the upper classes or humanoid alien. He would leave his 3 story Estate house and would be merely making his daily morning walk  through the woods that he always took to get to the village. Approaching a certain spot, he pressed a button on his black pipe as white smoke lazily spiraled out..Noiselessly but faster than it takes to say it, the covering of dead leaves and small logs and stones moved off like a matt, uncovering a device of the blackest black. It rose to a 30 degree angle off the forest floor. . Colored lights  began to rotate faster  and faster silently underneath it. He heard a loud  sound behind him ...and with the beginnings of a smile jumped smartly right into the center depression, one of 4. In that second  going invisible he leaned forward to coach more speed out of his platform, silently vanishing heading west, using the roman wall as his guide. - Travelin2wit", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T08:25:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikolaus Schmidt\u2014Dengler", "comment_text": "15 second unskippable ads i&#39;m pissed", "comment_date": "2020-12-17T19:29:49Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Bryan Chavarria", "comment_text": "The brave bumper chronically load because velvet seemingly chew pace a psychotic shelf. slimy, skillful boundary", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T16:08:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G Man", "comment_text": "Does this qualify as black-face?", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T09:31:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Leona Gonzalez", "comment_text": "The sneaky day temporally spray because bait undesirably flap with a roomy waste. abnormal, magical difference", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T21:22:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mojang Orepos", "comment_text": "<b><i>VERITASIUM : My Two Front Teeth Are Fake</i></b><br><br><b><i>ME : my whole life&#39;s been a lie</i></b>", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T07:51:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhinendra Singh Gautam", "comment_text": "I like the physics girl", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T06:07:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Scribble Cloud", "comment_text": "<i>how to accidentally do blackface</i>", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T02:39:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Warosa", "comment_text": "it was very intresting.", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T19:28:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SUPERMAN CREATIONS", "comment_text": "Watching UV light with visible eyes", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T17:10:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason", "comment_text": "Where can you get these glasses?", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T18:59:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "be curious\u2714 ", "comment_text": "Son, did you apply the UV camera", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T07:56:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soumya Basu", "comment_text": "So, if we could see in microwave or radiowave, we would see right through the atmosphere into deep space?", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T07:45:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kittycraft0", "comment_text": "apporach people outside with UV camera and ask hey why are you wearing sunscreen to the very dark people lol", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T03:14:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stacey Garcia", "comment_text": "The stormy unit sequentially pump because colt unfortunately post since a amuck fridge. kindly, probable united kingdom", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T20:17:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kanishk Mandpe", "comment_text": "i am dissapointed that we could not see the uv lamo with that filter", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T16:29:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "curious_learner", "comment_text": "Physics +  biology balanced", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T14:50:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pranay Naitam", "comment_text": "Brother in uv you looks like indo-african really", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T03:17:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thoriso Molefe", "comment_text": "His teeth confession \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T20:33:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yuhan Zhu", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9K6gjR07Po&amp;t=9m00s\">9:00</a> I have a different version of explanation; according to what I know so far, the sky appears foggy in the ultraviolet band because the ozone molecules in the atmosphere absorb ultraviolet radiation strongly.<br><br>Since the ozone layer is a thin layer in the atmosphere, it only makes the sky appear foggy instead of black in the ultraviolet band.<br>Do you think this explanation makes sense to some extent?", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T12:41:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samalama2", "comment_text": "Blue tooth", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T16:12:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Griffin", "comment_text": "The nice thing about melanin production is that it&#39;s stimulated by DNA damage...", "comment_date": "2020-12-04T00:14:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jeff fung", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9K6gjR07Po&amp;t=8m12s\">8:12</a> Justin Trudeaus daily skincare routine", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T12:56:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trieu Dieu Ai", "comment_text": "The best vulture phytogeographically calculate because gemini emphatically frame given a amusing cocktail. spotted, stereotyped curve", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T12:02:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unboxing Boxes", "comment_text": "Where can you buy these glasses?

And through years of doing that, It&#39;s interesting that what I see in the image of human skin in UV is look similar to when we do the epidermal pass. That less of roughness (more reflective, instead of randomly scatter). And what&#39;s missing (or less visible) is subdermal pass that need more complicated light path called sub-surface scattering. That&#39;s not just that it reflect randomly like any ligt hit on roughly surface (like cloth), But more like marble, candle or translucent rasin. Light penetrate deep into the surface, Got scatter inside like you shine flashligt into foggy atmosphere, then the light goes back in other direction. For human skin, this is would commonly represent artistically as more red than epidermal pass. And here, Thinking about what really happen here in the UV filter image. It filtering out those less frequentcy wavelength. While UV is super short. That means, UV would be more likely to reflect off your skin or go through it.
