This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DWnjcSo9J0&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead.

The systemic (whole body) effects however, are physically and physiologically distant from the lungs and therefore are more difficult to understand. The multi-system, wide spread systemic ramifications of chronic hyperventilation are numerous.<br><br>These effects are all caused by the initial effect of pulmonary hypocapnia (low CO2) which causes spasm of the airways leading to asthma. The loss of CO2 from the lung on a long term basis causes a compensatory response throughout the body. This concept is called homeostasis which means that the body is always trying to stay in balance and return to its most comfortable state.<br><br>A partial list of homeostatic controls would include:<br>- Constant body temperature<br>- Constant whole body water volume<br>- Glucose levels<br>- Mineral balance including sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc etc.<br>- Acid base balance (Ph control)<br><br>The acid base/Ph control mechanisms are very sensitive and closely controlled, because the Ph of the body affects the function of every body system. It is this system that is activated when patients chronically hyperventilate.<br><br>Understanding this concept, we can follow what happens with CHV.<br><br>- The lungs continuously blow off too much CO2 causing local pulmonary hypocapnia (low CO2) and arterial hypocapnia.<br><br>- The arterial hypocapnia immediately changes the Ph of the circulating blood causing an increase in the Ph (alkalosis).<br><br>- The increase in the Ph causes a decrease in the delivery of Oxygen to all the bodies tissues due to the Bohr Effect (In an alkalotic environment, the hemoglobin molecules in the red cells hold onto the oxygen molecules more tightly and will not release the O2 to the tissues).<br><br>- The kidneys see the alkalosis/Ph change and know that it must correct the bodies Ph back towards neutral (neutral Ph is a Ph of 7.40). Once CHV becomes long standing the kidneys response becomes an ongoing process in which the kidneys excrete bicarbonate in an attempt to correct the alkalosis which was created by the CHV.<br><br>- The net result is a depletion of the bicarbonate buffers due to continuous over excretion of bicarbonate which also causes the loss of electrolytes including magnesium and phosphorous which are lost with the bicarbonate.<br><br>- The loss of phosphorous also decreases the production of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) and ADP which are the bodies\u2019 main source of energy.<br><br>- This then causes a decrease in the functioning of many organs including the muscles, heart, lungs, bone marrow, immune system and liver.<br><br>- These functional changes, coupled with the arterial spasm that occurs directly due to the low CO2 levels in the blood, are expressed in the long term as muscle fatigue, hypertension due to arterial spasm, decrease in the oxygenation of the brain, migraine headaches due to arterial spasm, spasm of the arteries supplying the gut, decrease brain function with memory changes, alterations in the production of proteins and metabolism of lipids in the liver causing elevated cholesterol.<br><br>This is just a partial list of the systems, organs and bodily functions which are affected by CHV and the subsequent low CO2 levels in the lungs and blood.<br><br>This concept regarding the origins and causes of these diseases is very radically different from the way medical schools teach about these diseases. It is revolutionary and may be too simple for many academicians to accept or understand.", "comment_date": "2021-04-17T21:53:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bart De Bie", "comment_text": "Getting Started<br>by Peter Kolb<br><br>While the Buteyko method introduced into the west has been getting excellent results, it does not entirely accord with Professor Buteyko\u2019s recommended practice. During two weeks he spent in New Zealand in December 2000, he demonstrated the Buteyko technique as it should be practiced.<br><br>Aim<br>Firstly, it needs to be understood that breathing too much is a bad habit that leaves you with a debilitating shortage of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. It usually results from long term, undischarged stress. Any stress makes you breathe more. If this is sustained over a long time period it becomes a habit. The physiology behind this habituation process is well understood. Buteyko therapy aims at reversing this, by habituating to less breathing. You do this by developing and sustaining a feeling of a slight shortage of air over a long time period. This gradually restores your carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels back to normal.<br><br>Maximum Pause<br>While it is possible to stifle an asthma attack with a long and uncomfortable breath hold know as a maximum pause (MP), this procedure does not reverse your asthma and does not retrain the respiratory center to pace your breathing correctly. Professor Buteyko is emphatic that the maximum pause has no therapeutic value in restoring healthy breathing, which is the aim of his therapy. It is also dangerous for people with various disorders such as hypertension, heart disease, epilepsy, kidney disease and diabetes. It can also destabilize your breathing, making it worse. Unfortunately the maximum pause has been introduced into a westernized version of the Buteyko technique, much to the annoyance of the Professor.<br><br>An understanding of the physiology behind the Bueyko method leaves no doubt that the maximum pause cannot improve your breathing.<br><br>DIY/Self-help<br>Professor Buteyko is firmly opposed to the DIY/self-help approach. The Buteyko technique relies 100% on patient compliance for effectiveness. Learning it from a script is like learning Yoga or martial arts from a book. Most people will experience changes in their bodies as their CO2 levels rise. These changes vary from one individual to another. Buteyko practitioners help you deal with these changes, keep you motivated and ensure that you do the breathing exercises correctly. Support for your Buteyko practitioner enables him to continue his work of bringing the technique to other sufferers.<br><br>Nevertheless, very few people around the world have access to a Buteyko practitioner. So here are some basics to help get you started.<br><br>Medication<br>Do not make any changes to medication. Steroids must be taken as prescribed. Because of carbon dioxide shortage asthmatics often don\u2019t make enough Cortisol (natural steroid) and must have supplements. Steroids are not just anti-inflammatories but they are needed by the body and without the right amount it can be almost impossible to get breathing back to normal. Your doctor will be able to review your need for steroids when you stop having asthma symptoms.<br><br>Bronchodilators must be taken only when needed. As you progress, discuss with your doctor the possibility of weaning yourself off long acting bronchodilators and replacing them with short acting ones. That will give you more control over using them when needed. You should find that within days you will be able to overcome asthma attacks with reduced breathing and won\u2019t need the bronchodilators. Nevertheless, you must always carry them with you for emergencies.<br><br>Nose breathing<br>Always breathe through your nose. If your nose is blocked perform the following exercise: After breathing normally (do not make any exaggerated breathing manoeuvre), hold your breath for as long as is comfortable, and then gradually resume very gentle breathing. It may help to pinch your nose, nod your head a few times or do some other form of exercise. In stubborn cases or when the blockage is due to a cold, you may have to try a few more times.<br><br>To avoid breathing through your mouth in your sleep, you might like to experiment with a little light medical paper tape to keep your mouth closed. Mouth taping at night is not recommended by Professor Buteyko, but most people find it extremely valuable. If you do, protect your lips with suitable cream, use a low tack tape (some are quite aggressive), and make sure you fold a tab or handle at each end for rapid and easy removal. Do not go to sleep with tape on your mouth if this causes any form of anxiety.<br><br>Comfort<br>Make sure you\u2019re comfortable before starting the exercises. Remove unnecessary clothing since the improved blood carbon dioxide will dilate blood vessels in the skin, thereby warming you up.<br><br>Posture<br>To get your posture right stand with your back to a wall, heels, shoulders head and bottom touching the wall. Now drop your shoulders. Keep this upper body posture when sitting.<br><br>Relaxation<br>While maintaining your posture, relax all the muscles in your chest, neck, shoulders, arms, tummy and particularly the diaphragm. It\u2019s a good idea to tense them up a bit first before relaxing them so that you can properly identify them and make sure they are all relaxed.<br><br>Normal Breathing<br>Take off your shirt and stand in front of a full length mirror. Watch your chest and tummy for breathing movement. Make sure that your chest does not move at all, and only the upper part of the tummy moves, between navel and breast bone. The second thing to check for is that the tummy moves out with each in breath and not the other way around. Many people get this wrong. Your out-breath must be free, relaxed and unforced.<br><br>Reduced breathing (RB)<br>Your aim is to develop a feeling of slight hunger for air, sustain this over a period and do this frequently. In fact, this should become a habit so that you do it all the time until you have achieved your health goal.<br><br>Try to feel your breathing and become aware of your breathing pattern. Now try to maintain this pattern while taking in just a little less air on each breath so that you develop a slight hunger for air. Initially try to sustain this for two minutes, then five and then ten.<br><br>If you follow all the steps correctly, then you should feel really calm, good and even a little sleepy. If you already practice relaxation techniques, yoga etc, you can combine them with reduced breathing.<br><br>Measuring your breathing<br>Hyperventilators breathe more than normal in order to achieve lower than normal blood carbon dioxide levels. It follows that if you have to breathe more than normal, then you will also not be able to hold your breath as long as you should. Professor Buteyko has cunningly used this principle to measure your blood carbon dioxide by testing how long you can hold your breath.<br><br>You start the pause somewhere in your normal breathing cycle. This is how you start the pause: Look up with your eyes and at the same time pinch your nose and start a stop watch. Just before it starts to get uncomfortable, stop the stop watch and resume normal breathing. You should be able to resume normal breathing without any effort and without taking deeper or more frequent breaths.<br><br>Some precautions:<br>- Do not take a deeper breath before the pause.<br>- Do not make any attempt to empty the lungs before the pause.<br>- Do not worry about which phase of the respiratory cycle you happen to be in before starting the pause. A pause is just an interruption of normal breathing.<br><br>The time in seconds is called a Control Pause (CP). Asthmatics typically have a CP of 5 - 15 seconds. (But not everyone with such a low CP has asthma.) Your aim is to achieve a CP greater than 40 seconds, although for perfect health Professor Buteyko recommends a CP of at least 60 seconds.<br><br>Doing a Set<br>When at rest, correctly seated, comfortable and relaxed and after breathing normally for at least five minutes you are ready to do a set. A set consists of<br>Pulse - CP - Reduced breathing - 3min normal breathing - Pulse - CP<br><br>First measure your pulse and then do a CP. Record the results on a table. Then do reduced breathing for ten minutes. Breathe normally for three minutes, then take your pulse again and take another CP. If you\u2019ve done your reduced breathing correctly your pulse should go down and your CP should go up. Sometimes the pulse remains the same. If it goes up you\u2019re not doing it correctly.<br><br>After three days you should be able to do around 8 to 10 sets a day. You can then start integrating reduced breathing into your daily life. Ideally you should aim at doing reduced breathing all day.<br><br>That takes care of the exercises. Here are a few helpful hints to help your recovery.<br>- Don\u2019t eat unless you are hungry. Only eat until you have had enough. Eating increases breathing; eating excessively increases breathing excessively.<br>- Don\u2019t dress too warmly. Be careful not to overdress children. If you are worried about them being cold, check their ears, nose, hands and feet. If these are warm, they\u2019re OK.<br>- Make sure you get plenty of vigorous exercise. But don\u2019t exercise to the point where you have to open your mouth to breathe.<br><br>If any of these recommendations make you dizzy, sick, anxious or give you palpitations, stop immediately.

The danger is about &quot;incorporation&quot;, when radioactive material gets inside of your body. The natural background radiation is about 0.1 - 0.2 micro Sieverts /h (micro means 10 to the minus 6). You get radiation sickness by a dose from about 1 Sievert, which is 10 Million times 0.1 micro Sievert. In one hour in front of the reactor where he stands he gets a dose of about 5-6 micro Sieverts. A CT scan gets you a dose of about 4 milli Sieverts! So about a thousand times as much and two times what you normaly get in a year through natural background radiation. The problem in Chernobyl was that just on the roof of the reactor where soldiers had to remove parts of the reactor fuel the radiation was about 120 Sieverts/h, which gives you a lethal dose in a few minutes (120 Sv = 120,000,000 micro Sv). You may want to protect yourself when there are radioactive particles, that you could breathe in. But there is no real clothing that &quot;shields&quot; radiation. US radtiation workers are by the way limited to 50 milli Sieverts (50,000 micro Sieverts) of radiation per year. <br><br><br><br>The real problem is incorporation. Uranium-238 for example emits alpha radiation that from the outside normally doesn&#39;t penetrate through your skin. But when Uranium gets inside of your body, close or inside of a human cell it couses a lot of damage because alpha radiation has of all radiation types the highest ionising potential even thou it has the lowest penetration depth. By the way he has made another video called &quot;The most radioactive places on earth&quot; which is better than this one, where he examples a little bit about the radiation and its danger.", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T09:58:18Z", "likes_count": 301}, {"comment_by": "Chupy", "comment_text": "4.8 million views not not good but not terrible", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T09:40:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rt Rt", "comment_text": "Rip to the idiots who go here.", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T09:40:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ryker Bragg", "comment_text": "Such is life in the zone.", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T07:27:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Go Guerrero", "comment_text": "Came here because of the series.

In fact, they could find little or no effects on the animal life in the surrounding region, and the lack of human meant that the area was truly wild. <br>On top of that, it has been shown that the greatest after effects on the local population was not radiation-related. It was due to driving them from their homes. Depression and alcoholism caused far more problems that radiation had.

Parts of these events are signaled by the blowing of the third trumpet in chapter 8, a great star called Wormwood was cast into the earth.<br>\u00a0<br>The world\u2019s worst ever nuclear meltdown occurred in 1986 at Chernobyl in Ukraine, at that time one of the states of the Soviet Union. Incredibly, Chernobyl is the Russian word for wormwood! It appears that the Chernobyl catastrophe was the fulfillment of the sounding of the third trumpet of Revelation 8!<br>\u00a0<br>THE MELTDOWN<br><br>At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DWnjcSo9J0&amp;t=1m22s\">1:22</a> am on April 26, 1986, a Soviet reactor crew carelessly turned off the safety systems of the Chernobyl Unit 4 nuclear reactor to perform an unauthorized safety test.<br>\u00a0<br>Within 36 seconds the reactor surged out of control, and a steam explosion pierced the roof. Deprived of coolant, 150 tons or uranium fuel melted into lava that oozed into the basement of the reactor.<br>\u00a0<br>A second hydrogen explosion ignited blocks of graphite, rocketing a hot plume of radioactive particles a mile into the sky. The explosion was so powerful that it blew the 2 million pound concrete lid of the reactor into the air. For three weeks the fire spread out of control, sprinkling iodine-131 and other nuclides as far as Scandinavia, Italy, and Britain.<br>\u00a0<br>In an 18-mile radius around the reactor, Geiger counters found extraordinarily high-level \u201cgamma fields\u201d where the fire\u2019s plume brushed the ground. Authorities evacuated 170,000 people, threw up barbed wire, and declared the area a permanent \u201cexclusion zone.\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>IMPACT OF THE DISASTER<br><br>The explosion in Chernobyl\u2019s reactor released an immense cloud of radiation north of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev. The Chernobyl meltdown released 10 times the amount of radioactive substances as was released by the bombing of Hiroshima in World War II!<br>\u00a0<br>An estimated 125,000 people in the Ukraine have died because of the Chernobyl disaster, and two million have been infected. Disease rates in some regions are three times higher for children than before the accident, and four to five times higher for pregnant women. One million extra cases of cancer are predicted worldwide within 70 years, Ukrainian scientists estimate. Over 200 million people have experienced excess exposure to radiation because of Chernobyl.<br>\u00a0<br>Dr. Alexander Rykhlya, director of the department of international scientific and technical cooperation, gave this opinion: \u201cMy view is that as time passes the medical aftermath will become worse. The peak death rate has not yet been reached. It will be reached after one or two generations.\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>Most severely affected was the Gomel region, hit first by the radiation: the thyroid cancer rate there is now about 80 times the world average. \u201cThe only reasonable explanation,\u201d write the Belarus officials, \u201cis that it is a direct consequence of the accident at Chernobyl.\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>In the most badly affected areas, such as the Gomel area in the south, just over the border from Chernobyl, the cesium-137 surface contamination is more than 1,480 kilobecquerels per square meter, 1,000 times the norm. The normal level of radiation in the soil before the disaster was 1.48 kBq.<br>\u00a0<br>In these areas the forest looks as though it has been struck by lightning. Efforts are being made to bury radioactive trees, but the financial burden is too great. Only the animals remain. \u201cThere are large numbers of wild deer, elk and boar because it is a closed area,\u201d said Professor Alexandr Stozharov, director of the Research Institute of Radiation Medicine. \u201cSome are shot by the guards because they can transmit radiation to the clean zones.\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>More than 3 million acres of farmland\u2014an area about the size of Connecticut\u2014is considered lost for a century.<br>\u00a0<br>More than nine years after what everybody calls \u201cthe tragedy\u201d, Pripyat, the city near Chernobyl, is still dead and deadly. No one can live here\u2014at least for long.<br>\u00a0<br>Weeds stand shoulder high along the wide avenues; a Ferris wheel is rusting behind the cinema. The dozens of tall apartment buildings where 49,000 people once lived still look new, but their windows are open, broken, and blank. Trucks spray chemicals on decaying streets so the breezes that rustle dead leaves of dead trees won\u2019t spread their contaminated dust.<br>\u00a0<br>\u201cThis is the one place where you could understand how the world would be after a nuclear war,\u201d says Sergei Akulinin, who lived only 7 minutes from the Chernobyl power plant where he worked.<br>\u00a0<br>All animals and other foodstuffs that were contaminated by the radiation had to be destroyed. Several tens of thousands of rabbits raised for meat had to be destroyed. Nearly 100,000 reindeer being raised in Europe had to be killed and buried.<br>\u00a0<br>Cesium-137 has a half-life of 30 years. As a result, when food that contains radiation is eaten it gets in the muscles and stays for a very long time. It eventually causes cancer.<br>\u00a0<br>THE WATERS MADE BITTER<br><br>The prophecy of the third trumpet emphasizes that the star called Wormwood made the waters bitter. As the nuclear cloud produced by Chernobyl drifted over the Soviet Union and over Europe, an extraordinary amount of rain fell. The rain brought the radiation from the nuclear cloud onto the soil, the animals, the crops, the trees, and into the rivers. The greater the rainfall, the greater was the amount of radioactivity. These heavy rains greatly increased the magnitude of this horrible disaster. Much of Europe was affected. When the prophecy said that many men died because of the waters, it explicitly described the effect of Chernobyl.<br>\u00a0<br>TESTIMONIES FROM CHERNOBYL<br><br>Oleg Genrikh and Anatoly Kurguz were two of the workers on duty at Chernobyl at the time of the accident. Kurguz sat at his desk and made entries in his log. Three open doors stood between him and the reactor hall. When the nuclear reactor blew up, highly radioactive steam with nuclear fuel surged into the room where Kurguz had been sitting. He dashed through this inferno to try to close the door. Closing it, he shouted to Genrikh, \u201cFire! Everything\u2019s on fire!\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>Genrikh leaped up from his cot where he had been taking a nap, and dashed to open his door. He opened it a little, but beyond it was such an unbearable smell of burning that he gave up trying, and instinctively lay down on the linoleum, where it was a little cooler. He shouted to Kurguz, \u201cTolya! Lie down! It\u2019s cooler on the floor!\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>Kurguz went in with Genrikh, and both of them lay down on the floor. \u201cThere at least we were able to breathe. I had a funny burning sensation in my lungs,\u201d Genrikh later recalled.<br>\u00a0<br>They waited about 3 minutes, by which time the heat had abated somewhat\u2014as it should, since there was now no roof over their heads. Then they went out into the corridor along axes 50-52 of the building. The severely blistered skin on Kurguz\u2019s bleeding face and arms was hanging off in strips.<br>\u00a0<br>On the way to the control room, two operators from the gas circuit, Simekonov and Simonenko, joined Genrikh and Kurguz. By now, Kurguz was in very poor shape: he was bleeding, and the skin under his clothes was covered with blisters. No one could do much to help him, as the slightest contact caused him intense pain. One wonders how he managed to walk the rest of the way to the medical center. Genrikh\u2019s burns were less serious, as the windowless room had protected him. Both of them, however, had received a dose of 600 roentgens.<br>\u00a0<br>Similar experiences were later recounted by most of the operators that were on duty that fateful April 26th morning. Most of the Chernobyl personnel that were working during the meltdown died extremely painful deaths within the next few weeks or months from radiation exposure.<br>\u00a0<br>COULD THE THIRD TRUMPET HAVE BEEN SOUNDED IN 1986?<br><br>It is an awesome thing to contemplate the possibility that the third trumpet of Revelation 8 was sounded in 1986. Yet the evidence that this is true seems undeniable. What are the odds that the world\u2019s greatest ever nuclear accident would occur at a power plant named Wormwood\u2014the exact name prophesied 2,000 years ago in the Bible? The prophecy says that it was because of the waters that were made bitter that many men died. The conveyance of nuclear radiation by the water was the thing that caused so many to die.<br>\u00a0<br>Some have thought that the events of the seals, trumpets, and vials of Revelation must all occur during the Great Tribulation, but scripture does not say this. It can be proven that the first four seals of Revelation 6 have now been opened for some time (See chapter three of A Message for the President).
