Great job. If you ever want to do a video on Mass Spectrometry or Py-GCMS. That is my life long experience. Everything from Forensics to Authentication of valuable paintings.

It seems very accurate to my life right now. <br><br>I love chemistry so much and I want to pursue a path that involves chemistry but my parents say otherwise. They want me to become engineers like them and just earn money. But I don&#39;t want to do something that I don&#39;t like. I didn&#39;t want to be like them since my 6th grade (now 12th) because they&#39;re always in front of the computer and complain about their health. They make good money and if I follow their footsteps they think that I&#39;ll be financially secure. But I want to tutor in my 18, 19, 20s and do a phd in chemistry simultaneously and become a professor and researcher in chemistry. It would earn me so much less but it&#39;s what I love. What&#39;s your advice? I&#39;m really confused. I become very frustrated whenever I have this conversation with my parents and feel hopeless. They make me feel like I have no future if I pursue chemistry. <br><br>Also in India, computer science is given the most preference and if you choose any other stream in PCM they treat it as if it&#39;s of lower value. I haven&#39;t written JEE mains and advanced yet but I&#39;m gonna write it in a few months and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m gonna get a nice rank and have this conversation wih my parents again.

I did my bachelor in Physics and got lost studying Environmental Science for my Master degree in Perth  (What did I think at that time, poor me). I got lost in teaching environmental science for about 6 years after master graduation but wasn&#39;t happy at all doing it (sorry my then dear students). In total I&#39;ve spent 10 years of my life doing stuff outside of physics and this doesn&#39;t make me happy at all. I applied for scholarship and got it to do PhD in Environmental Soil Physics at the University of Sydney. I just started 3 months but found myself unhappy doing it because my passion is filmmaking and physics education. I don&#39;t wanna be a scientist but I wanna incorporate filmmaking and physics education. I produced 2 short movies and both won Indonesian short movie national competition 2 years consecutively. So, now I&#39;m in the process of transferring to physics education for my PhD and will start soon in July 2022. I&#39;ve been making some vlogs around Sydney but don&#39;t have the courage yet to make videos related to physics education. I go to YouTube to find inspiration and found you. Voila, What a coincidence!!!! Never knew, never watched, never be informed about you before!!! I&#39;m so inspired by you. I hope that I will be able to achieve success as you do. The thing I found is that now I feel so much more happier inside because I get to do what I love the most in life. I&#39;ll be spending 3.5 years doing my PhD in physics education and I&#39;m studying the whole day and night now to find my true self about what I really want to produce. I&#39;m 35yo and feel empowered than ever to start a new chapter of my life and going back to my real calling in life. Wish me luck!!!!

I think your channel is one of the best on educating science in an entertaining way. <br><br>But note, I just got censored by (?) for commenting on one of your videos regarding the fact that the problem of success of being educated by mere technology requires interactivity, something that I agree to you about. However, I argued that the main reason for success, and something I see you just proved to me here, is that the fortune of being able to FAIL multiple times relates to one&#39;s wealth class (as per the usual inheritance based upon one&#39;s family wealth background) and that there exists a bias against those who are not due to the fact that they are not permitted to fail in only a few instances sufficient to assure their failure regardless. As such, I feel that the fortune of the &#39;interactivity&#39; is also denied by the poor. [I didn&#39;t say it exactly like this.]<br><br>As such, we (like myself being relatively poor), are not permitted the right to the interactivity without being undermined by a sense of &#39;authoritarianism&#39; when or where relatively free options are permitted. This kind of format is good. But I notice that even when I post alot anywhere, I get completely ignored. In places we are permitted, such as online forums, the ones that are available &#39;freely&#39; tend to demand extensively undeserved or unearned relative respect such that we get censored (and censured) when or where we dare to speak against conventional views. While I understand a lot of people may appear unusually defiant or as &#39;nutcases&#39;, this tends to duncecap those people who are literally PRACTICING their process of scientific skepticism, regardless of how wrong they could be. But given they too don&#39;t get far before being censored (or censured), they are only proven (scientically to themselves) that society biases the right of BEING or PRACTICING free thought needed as an internalizing mechanism for learning based upon biases that more often than not, relate to ones privileges (ie degree of better wealth). <br><br>But thanks for your channel, regardless. For those of us who like to learn foundationally, this at least provides us the information about present science in a way that relates...especially with how your visualizing graphics and social demeanor. Just try to reflect upon this if or where others struggle and are not able to fail without more unusual discrimination against them.

In my opinion you are a very educated man with a strong hold over science and you definitely had all qualities to become a sci-fi film maker only if you have gone to some other place to reach your dreams than Australia.

As an engineer, and chemist, working for a scientific instruments company, I was tasked with running training courses for customers. The customers sometimes had no scientific background, and some had PhDs. I had to find a way of communicating the content, across a broad spectrum of intellect. I think I did OK. And I think you are doing much the same, and doing a wonderful job. Science is wonderful, once you understand some of it and start asking questions.

I can relate, even though my boy now has a beard of his own &amp; my daughter has a husband of her own.  I want to mention a few things in relation to the direction I&#39;d like to see you go.  I think of the podcast of Steven Levitt (people I mostly admire) he did with Ken Jennings and what was discussed in terms of education.  How the pandemic has helped push learning like what you provide on Veritasium forward.  And what really good teachers provide.  I also think of a Dr. Zac Bush - many of his videos with the Global Health Education Summit are too long, lack charts, resources within the video that help you follow along.  They make me think of listening to a sermon or a lecture.  Neither of which I care to hear very often, but I think he might have some good information in terms of where the world should maybe head (which I think I could summarize as anti-chemical, anti-disease focus).  So I am not saying that Dr. Bush is 100% correct in any way, but if you think someone like that could merit your help in terms of presentation - then maybe that could be a direction for you.  Also last night I watched a show I think on PBS about music photography.  And they debated the analog to digital change, and how instant &amp; abundant pictures have become.  So what if what you post/upload in terms of new content takes longer?  Scarcity is a good thing for the value of demand!

If you want to make a living and you have to choose between being a dull economist and a bright but unspecialized intellect, you&#39;re better off being a dull economist. Any payoff from ability can only be realized within a narrowly focused field, and if you want material success within any narrow field, ability is not your best strategy to get there.

In listening to and watching you share the twists and turns of your young and adult life, you remind me that each step I have taken -- most of which I have enjoyed and substantively gained from, a few not so much -- are valuable excursions that, when examined together, constitute the greater adventure that reflects who I am and points me towards who I will ultimately be, for in the end we are the journey. Our circumstances and life stories are not particularly congruent, our backgrounds fairly but not completely dissimilar, but we share interests and also (what I find is key) the heart of a storyteller, and I am so pleased you found the right locale to realize your dream of being the filmmaker and have so generous a disposition in making it real.

I studied engineering physics at UBC in the 1980s, around the time you were born, and spent more than half my life in Vancouver or Victoria. I&#39;m in Berlin now. <br>And like you, I&#39;m doing cool stuff too: Energy system transition modeling and cleantech financial mechanism design.<br>Here&#39;s an idea for Veritasium: Do a prolonged serious on how - in financial engineering and technology buildout terms - the world can <b>rapidly</b> stop putting more CO2 into the atmosphere and move to net negative annual emissions upwards of 30 GtCO2 per annum.<br>I track this closely in the peer-reviewed press and talk to climate scientists. We will have to achieve net negative emissions on that scale or better ASAP, well before midcentury - we should aim at 2035 with a stretch goal of 2030 - if we&#39;re to have any chance of stopping the accelerating ice mass loss from GrIS and WAIS and an irreversible self-reinforcing meltdown dynamic that will culminate with at least ten meters of sea level rise within a century or three. The tipping point is here now - and in fact we may have already passed it; interim solar radiation management may be the only remaining pathway to stabilising the two ice sheets, and at this stage it&#39;s not entirely clear that even that would work.\u00a0<br>Do we want to preserve our coastal cities or don&#39;t we? It&#39;s decision time. It&#39;s either already too late or almost too late to stop the self-reinforcing ice sheet melt-down in Greenland and West Antarctica.<br>What&#39;s missing is a sufficient general awareness that with the right financial mechanisms deployed to fund the transition, this is an incredible business and virtuous-circles-rich employment and infrastructure upgrade opportunity, a direct pathway to universal access to cheap renewable energy and back to climate safety too if done at the scale the engineering physics and climate dynamics demand.<br>We have to understand and deal with this problem as a systems engineering challenge, and just get it done. Our model at LUT (developed by Prof. Christian Breyer et al.) calculates cost-optimal combinations of 120 key infrastructure technologies in a sector-coupled energy systems transition model.\u00a0<br>The way forward in media terms (I&#39;m a recovering business and science journalist) is to interview and convene very smart financial experts with close access to policy leaders, and coax a consensus from them on the optimal design of specific financial instruments. People from ECB, from World Bank, from private finance, from finance academia. We can ask them how we could define the transition in engineering systems pathway terms, figure out what needs to be built in which quantities by when and where, finance the transition, and collectively thrive is so doing. We&#39;re setting about putting that question out there. <br>Maybe that question could be picked up in a Veritasium video series. Maybe that could help change the trajectory of the world a bit. Help bend the curve, Veritasium. As you said so eloquently in your beautiful video: Sometimes trying works. I don&#39;t think you used those specific words, but that&#39;s what it amounted to. That happens to be my motto. It turns out to be a truth.

So abandoning my plans of pursuing a career in filmmaking, I took a diploma of science (which I loved). In 2019 I graduated with a diploma of physics and chemistry in France while spending my third and last abroad at UCLA where I took a lot of film courses, made a film about \u00e0 character who wasn\u2019t happy and metaphorically representing insecurity and unhappiness of not being at the place you wish you\u2019d be. I won a best directing price. This pushed me towards a new path : filmmaking. I couldn\u2019t take physics anymore, i was at the edge of mentally breaking, it was hard to maintain focus in classes, and having good grades.

So I guess it takes a natural desire and lifelong dedication to get there. I see a rigid parallelism between his story and Elon Musk&#39;s.

A science pop culture phenomenon that has recently gained momentum is the Simulation Theory, that our universe is a simulated video game.

For all of the Veritasium videos, but also for this video. I have been watching your videos partly because I think science and especially physics is a fascinating subject. The other reason I watch your videos has entirely to do with you. You choose interesting topics within the broad field of physics, you present the concepts in a way that I find engaging and easy to understand (maybe not at first, but always by the end of the video). Also, your personality comes across in a mildly charismatic and comforting way. You seem like a regular person, which is important and not something that I can say about all science educators. It was great to see your early videos with all the clunky awkwardness of anyone beginning a new challenge. I think it is true in almost every case that one of the strongest tools a beginner has is not knowing how bad they are so they can have time to work it all out and not give up before they get going. In acting this can be a challenge since there is no shortage of people willing to point out how bad you are. This can be discouraging especially since everyone in the world will point out that the odds are heavily stacked against you and you rarely hear that everyone was terrible at what they do when they first started out. The thing is, you will always make it at what you want to do if you never give up. Anyway, thanks again.

Another name is nerve conductive velocity or brain speed. Prof. John Ertl while at Ottawa University worked on the relationship between NE and intelligence and could determine IQ by measuring NE. This got the attention of bioelectric engineer David Graham who having worked with EEG equipment knew that NE was variable. He built a machine called the Graham potentializer that seriously cranked up NE. What he did not know was that IQ was the result of acquired thinking skills while enjoying high NE and that took time. Dr. Frank Begau  created a balance board  that increased NE and had his children using one each day before going to school. Their SAT results were hugely above what otherwise would be expected. He once commented to me that while he and his wife Barbara were quite intelligent their children were standard deviations beyond them. Another interesting fact about NE is that people with high NE are able to make full recoveries from strokes. I know of 3 college professors (High IQ types) who suffered strokes or massive head injuries and trained their way back to teaching college again. Professor Michael Merzenich based his understanding of neural plasticity on the college professor who made a full recovery. They autopsied his brain when he died decades after his stroke and found the stroke area had never recovered and that his brain had rewired itself.

I&#39;m sure you are told, countless times, how &#39;lucky&#39; you are. I bring that up because just a short few minutes ago I watched your presentation on the role of luck vs effort or merit. Looking at this piece, what I see is that your &#39;luck&#39; is comprised of being born to parents who loved each other enough to stay married to each other and  who were determined to see their children succeed by providing for them the best opportunities that could be had. Is it &#39;luck&#39; ONLY in the sense that it was not due to YOUR efforts, but the effort of others. But, in the grand scheme of things who and what you are today; what you have managed to achieve, artistically and professionally, the percentage attributable to that component that you and others call &#39;luck&#39; begins to diminish pretty dramatically. That is because it was YOU that charted your course, that had the aspiration and inspiration to pursue other paths, while you also developed your filmmaking career and the requisite skills to be successful in that. You did not meet your beautiful bride, the mother of your children, by happenstance, OTHER THAN, again, what put her in your path and you in hers. While my personal story is utterly different from yours in every single detail, the overarching pattern is not that different. I&#39;ve had several careers because I failed or got fired or got injured or got divorced and at the occurrence of each of those events, like Newton&#39;s laws of motion, my life&#39;s trajectory was altered, ever so slightly because I had to make new choices, one of which led me to go back to school where I met my wife.

I think your personal career trajectory was just about perfect. Being bright and creative is not good enough to produce the things that you do. You need to be educated enough to understand what you are talking about, and to select things that are worthwhile to communicate. It is refreshing that you are realistic about the fact that luck plays a part in people&#39;s success. It is also refreshing that you imply that nobody makes it alone. I had a great career because I was doing what I loved. I hope you are able to continue on with your vision. It&#39;s a wonderful thing to be alive at this time in history. We are, I  think, right around the heel of an exponential curve, and shortly, things will shoot straight up. You are a good communicator. You are charismatic on video. Maybe practice makes perfect here. :) Going forward, as evidenced by how frighteningly bungled our COVID response was, we need people who are visible, understand, able to communicate, and engaging enough that people will listen. Anybody who could read a graph knew that we were in imminent danger back in February 2020. In the years ahead, as change accelerates, we are going to need people able to understand and communicate sound advice. Meantime, your focus on your family is where it belongs. They will be your greatest joy, and you will be theirs. Anyway, I greatly enjoyed this video.

When I was five, we came out of the grocery store one day, and when I looked across the street, I spotted a chemistry set in the window of a drug store. I nagged and begged my mother to buy it for me. She had the good sense to realize a five-year-old should not have a chemistry set. One Christmas morning a week before my twelfth birthday I found a chemistry set (Gilbert) and small telescope under the Christmas tree. The following Christmas I got a microscope set (also Gilbert). My journey had begun. Some sixty years later, I still have parts of the chemistry set, Microscope set, and the complete telescope.\r<br>\r<br>One of my favorite places in the world were the science shelves of the local library. I spent many hours looking at and checking out books from those shelves. One of the highlights was the book, &quot;Relativity for the Million&quot; by Martin Gardener that I read when I was thirteen. It was easy to understand and made perfect sense. That book launched my lifelong interest in the works of Albert Einstein and my intense study of both Special and General Relativity. I found a collectors copy of an early edition in excellent condition a few years ago and promptly bought it for my library. If you can find it, it is worth reading. If you cannot find it, you might want to read &quot;Relativity, Simply Explained,&quot; also written by Martin Gardner.<br><br>As might be expected, my college major was Chemistry, not just any chemistry major, but the American Chemical Society (ACS) Certified Professional Chemist curriculum. It required 43 hours of Chemistry as opposed to the 30 hours required for all other majors. It required a senior research project and paper, which luckily did not have to be defended. I ended up doing two projects, and chose one for my paper. In addition, my minor had to be either Physics or Math, with Physics being the preferred choice. I decided to pursue a double major in both Chemistry and Physics with a math minor. The most difficult part was the four semesters of German (not to mention translating Kafka&#39;s insane &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;), with the final course being Scientific German.\r<br>\r<br>Unfortunately, the University had some stupid rule about taking six credits of science in addition to your major and minor, designed primarily for non-science majors. I was trapped in a bureaucratic nightmare having eschewed all science classes outside Chemistry and Physics. I finally had to settle for Chemistry as my major, Math as my minor, and thirty credits of Physics as my \u201cthird science.\u201d  After five and a half years of university study with 173 credit hours (120 credit hours are normal), this was the disappointing result.\r<br>\r<br>Just for the hell of it, I decided to take the admissions tests for graduate school (GRE), law school (LSAT), and business school (GMAT). Low and behold, I scored high enough to be accepted to all three. I decided not to attend any of them at that time, instead, a friend and I decided to start a small chemical consulting and research company. To be honest, it was all research and no consulting. There is not a lot of call for that kind of work in Southeast Florida. We started doing research on the production of Ethyl Cyanoacrylate, which is the chemical name for the instant glues which used to be marketed as \u201cPermabond\u201d, and \u201cKrazy Glue\u201d just to name a couple. You know, the glue that sticks your fingers together in an instant, but not the object you are actually trying to glue.\r<br>\r<br>One late night we discovered the \u201cMagic Juice\u201d, a mixture of two chemicals that revolutionized the process. As my friend said, it was like something out of an old-time science fiction or horror movie. When we mixed the two liquids, the mixture began to boil and release steam into the air. So, there we stood with this flask of boiling steaming liquid, what choice did we have but to add it to the large flask containing the raw materials for the reaction. That along with two other changes in the process allowed us to run the initial reaction at a greatly reduced temperature, with about a fifty percent increase in the percentage yield.\r<br>\r<br>Ethyl cyanoacrylate is a monomer (single molecule) that uses water to polymerize (multiple molecules bonded together into a long chain), so it has to be distilled in a vacuum to keep out all moisture. We could distill with higher pressures and we had completely eliminated the problem of polymerization in the vacuum pump which used to gum it up making it necessary to constantly take it apart to clean it. We also had a better stabilizer for the finished product, which allowed my friend to store a bottle of the finished glue for almost 20 years without any degradation. Alas, no one wanted to buy our process. We did not patent it, and we chickened out at the thought of manufacturing the clue ourselves. I have not checked on the manufacturing process employed nowadays, so I have no idea if they are still using the antiquated, inefficient process we started with. I also occasionally wonder if anyone else discovered our &quot;Magic Juice,&quot; or any of the other improvements we discovered 45 years ago. \r<br>\r<br>I ended taking a job as an industrial R&amp;D Chemist with a medium sized paint and coatings company. Of all the work I did, my most ambitious project was developing a paint for the airplanes of a commercial airliner (United). Airplanes are notoriously difficult to paint, because they are made out of aircraft grade aluminum, and all aluminum alloys are almost impossible to paint. The challenge was to make a paint that resists the actions of the harsh cleaning chemicals, aircraft hydraulic fluid, and aircraft fuel. It has to be tough enough to resist the wind abrasion while being shiny and flexible enough to resist the cold, and rippling of the surface encountered in high altitude flying.\r<br>\r<br>Painting airplanes is a four-step process. The surface has to be cleaned, then a coating called a wash-coat primer is applied, followed by an epoxy-urethane primer, and finally a catalyzed urethane topcoat. My job was to develop the latter three-part paint system. After a year and a half, I was ready for a real-world test. The paint had passed every laboratory test, so I made a couple of gallons of each of the three-part system and sent it out to be painted on a section of an airplane. Horrors, it flaked and peeled off after a few hours of flight. I eventually solved the problems, but our company\u2019s ridiculous pricing policy made it too expensive, so almost two years of hard work was for naught. It was then that I decided to enroll in the MBA program at out local university. After two years, I finished the degree and my company offered me a management position with all kinds of pie in the sky offers. When it came to actually negotiating my salary and benefits, the cheap owner began hemming and hawing and paring down the offer until it was so poor that I would have been a fool to stay. I ended up moving into a management position with a local manufacturing company. It didn\u2019t take long to realize that this was a big mistake and that I hated that kind of work.\r<br>\r<br>I decided to try teaching for a year or two while I decided what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life. To my surprise, it turned out to be teaching. I had a 33-year career teaching, and while some of it has been tumultuous and frustrating, it was my passion. Really knowledgeable Physics teachers are very hard to find, so they are in high demand, so I could pretty much pick and choose where I taught. I decided to pursue a graduate degree in Physics, which took quite a while as I tried to find classes I could attend while I worked full time. I eventually finished my M.S. With only an M.S. a professorship at a university is pretty much out of the question. In addition, while the teaching load was much lighter, the salary and benefits were also MUCH LOWER. At best, I could be a full-time instructor, but never a tenured professor, so High School is where I went. The aggravating part is that I am a much better teacher than most of the professors I had, who stood at the board delivering dry long-winded lectures as they wrote endless equations on the board with virtually no explanations while students struggled to copy the equations so they could go off on their own to decipher the scribblings. A PhD does not necessarily produce a great teacher, something Universities should consider.\r<br>\r<br>People who have known me for a long time will say they are not surprised I ended up teaching, because I was always teaching my entire life. Anytime I discovered something new and interesting, I had to pass it along to everyone I could get to listen, often boring them to death because they had no interest in what I was talking about. I count my wife as a success story because she now knows more about physics than most people, including many marginal Physics teachers I have met along the way. She even follows several science related sites on Facebook.\r<br>\r<br>This February (2021), I will be retired six years, and I still miss teaching. I watch YouTube videos and when I see something interesting or unusual, I begin to think about how to use it in my classroom. Then I remember, I have no classroom anymore, so I inflict my lessons on unsuspecting YouTube watchers in the comments section. I also satisfy my need to teach by frequenting homework help sites and the Physics and Chemistry pages on Quora. The difference is that they all have the option to ignore my writings while my students were captives. LOL.\r<br>\r<br>Today I am in the process of building an old-fashioned lab bench in my garage based on a picture I cut out of a magazine many decades ago. I ended up pursuing my dream without realizing it was my dream when I started out those many years ago looking at that chemistry set in the drugstore window.\r<br>\r<br>Wayne Y.

Not just because it was so heartfelt and personal, but because I relate to your story so much. First I want to thank you for sharing and being so candid. Success stories are a beautiful thing -- art in and of themselves -- but the ambition, drive, motivations behind the path to success can sometimes be really really nasty.<br><br>When I was in engineering school at GA Tech my advisor looked at the German and French classes on my schedule and said, &quot;You&#39;re not thinking like an engineer.&quot; I was so offended I started an argument and he promptly kicked me out of his office, telling me go find another advisor. I graduated, albeit barely, thinking I was on my way to fulfilling my dream to one day be an astronaut and go to mars. Ah, but the Challenger had blown up that year and there were no jobs in Aerospace.<br><br>So after getting rejected by literally every aero firm in the U.S., when I finally managed to land a job, I immediately discovered computer programming, which I fell in love with, so I (painfully) made that transition. And I eventually secured a team lead position at the Red Cross. But I was also inseparable from my creative side. For me it was poetry and songwriting, so I pursued that alongside my &quot;real&quot; job, and eventually managed to join a band, play out, and even write/record my own album. Oh but I was also very into cognitive science, AI, and neurology; so I was pursuing my masters as well...<br><br>Then 9/11 happened. And none of those goals seemed to matter; so after podcasting for a while I started writing a novel about...well, a guy who drops his plans for college after 9/11 and joins the military to go off and save the world. And the book was finally published in 2016, but it&#39;s not like I was an author, really. And, just like you mentioned about filmmaking, that business is no meritocracy. So the novel could become the next Confederacy Of Dunces, but great reviews are no guarantee, and to rely on other people&#39;s interests -- or their awareness, or even their assessment of what good art even is -- is an extremely dangerous thing. So only time will tell. But it took a long time for me to recognize becoming a published author as my absolute greatest accomplishment, odd as that may sound.<br><br>It&#39;s now 25 years after I started my career, I am working as an engineer in Germany (take that, Ducoff! haha) and yet still unsatisfied and ambitious and dreaming and, well, trying to decide what I want to be when I grow up. So yes, it is fine to lie to yourself and say you not only CAN do anything but will one day do EVERYTHING. Just make damned sure you never wake up one day to its doppelganger, truth, staring you in the face, grinning. Because that is scary AF, believe me. What really matters in the end, as David Brooks has pointed out, is how much you have helped those around you, not some arbitrary societal notion of success you have internalized or fed off of because it was so intoxicating.", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T17:08:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kumar", "comment_text": "You are an inspiration Derek...", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T10:12:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MR.

Very interesting.  You&#39;ve led an amazing and blessed life.<br><br>That said...  I find it befuddling when smart, talented people gain an incredible education and then turn on a dime and pursue something else.  This is a subject worthy of considerable investigation and study, if you ask me.  The amount of time, money and energy invested in a pursuit by the individual as well as society absolutely wasted in an instant.  Well, not completely wasted, but not getting anyone&#39;s money&#39;s worth.  It would be interesting to see what percentage of higher education is wasted on people who never even use their professional skill set in their careers.  <br><br>What does this say?  His Phd in physics was attained with a half-hearted attitude when he really wanted to pursue film.  What about the truly passionate student of physics he displaced who was forced to find another path?  I&#39;d say in a perfect world, he would have pursued film, loved it, and earned a tidy living in a lucrative career.<br><br>I know a mathematician engineer from Iran.  Really smart and well-educated.  He&#39;s in the US selling real estate.  What a joke.  <br><br>Stories like this abound and it&#39;s unfortunate.  It&#39;s inefficient and it acts to derail the dreams of others.  If your heart wasn&#39;t in studying engineering and physics, then it&#39;s a shame.  A shame that your spot in engineering school was taken and the kid who&#39;s entire life dream to study engineering was thwarted.

We can&#39;t hang out with our fellow citizens, we can&#39;t talk to much or too loudly,...because our atomized breath spreads the disease. I wear a face/mouth mask,....I can&#39;t see people&#39;s faces anymore. There is no cure, presently or a vaccine.  My only saving grace is I have a wonderful garden in my backyard, where I can at least hang out in nature, and not have to go anywhere. I own a house and my backyard is fairly large. A stranger picks up my groceries, and we talk for less than 20 minutes, once a week. In the mean time, most of my friends are hunkered down, in their houses and apartments.

Lots of career paths. Lots of experiences. Lots of situations, circumstances, and so on. But what you could do - since you&#39;re looking for ideas - is to explore the Law of Cause and Effect. I too, am tired of watching billionaires tell me &quot;This is how I did it!&quot; I know several billionaires and more than my share of multi-millionaires and, almost to a person, they ascribed luck as the main driver. Where they were, who they happened to meet, that sort of thing.<br><br>One would think that planning and strategizing properly would be the main driver of success.

Within a minute or two an engrossing conversation would evolve.  He went on to found a company that makes video editing systems, so that tens of thousands of people could tell their story in film.  That company became successful, which was of course wonderful, but not absolutely necessary.  His intention was (and is) so simple it is simply *unstoppable*.  Even if the company had failed he would have found a way to realize his fundamental intention, because he simply finds joy in helping people tell their story.

I can&#39;t say exactly what it is; perhaps even he cannot, but it&#39;s clearly there.

You have established a new paradigm for learning and teaching and are doing a great job with it. IMHO, Universities, while they&#39;re fun and I highly recommend the experience, they have mostly short-changed parents and under-served our kids. As you discussed in &#39;Your Story&#39; the path you took was science/engineering but that path had communication and film laced through it. That itch to do film making colored everything you did. And now it has infused and has coalesced with your brilliant science mind and provided you/us with a valuable platform to teach/learn. Learning should never be draconian and punitive. Too many professors, and subsequently the universities themselves are not getting it done. So being a BFA Theater performance major in college was great. But my real interest/hobby is science. So I watch your Mandelbrot Set video, I read Astrophysics, Brownian motion, wave particle duality and anything else I can get my hands on and truly learn more then I would if I was in college. Being a communicator is in my opinion critical in effective teaching. And having a pleasing personality makes it more enjoyable. Being brilliant on top of it is just an extra bonus! Thanks. Oh yeah.

I tried some scientist federation websites but I needed something more interactive. Then with a hopeless mind I searched at youtube and I was amazed. With the help of people like you, I can correct my hypothesises much more easily and find the topics I need to deep dive much more faster. Even sometimes, I don&#39;t search for anything.

Sad thing, and this really isn\u2019t a pity party on my part, is that I just don\u2019t have the means to. Not at this point. I wish I had focused more in my life\u2019s educational \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d. <br>But I didn\u2019t, so I do the best I can and I work a regular job and I satisfy my deep need to learn and research and feel like I\u2019m progressing or doing something in some way by reading a lot, playing a ton of simulation type games, watching YouTube videos about calculus and space and chemistry, and generally just learning more and more stuff that really serves no necessity in my life because I made mistakes when I was younger that I didn\u2019t realize would be the kind of mistakes that you can never reverse. Lol. <br>One thing I do want to say to kids and generate just younger people out there, is this. Don\u2019t for a second take for granted your education, no matter how formal or outdated you think the educational system is. Because bottom line is, if you don\u2019t have one, you\u2019ll never be an engineer or rocket scientist or molecular engineer by self-teaching. And you\u2019ll never get the job you want or push the boundaries of your most loved field of science by just learning on the internet and YouTube. You just have to have that piece of paper, and you have to go through the formal motions of getting a degree from an accredited college.<br>Don\u2019t think for a second, or let someone tell you that the only way you can mess up your life is to like, be a felon or drug addict or commit murder and be thrown in jail for the rest of your life. Because I never did any of those things, and I\u2019ve affectively crippled my future by thinking \u201cidk exactly what I want to do and I can\u2019t have the things I want to have so I\u2019m just going to quit school and work full time for now so I can be more independent\u201d. Believe me. It\u2019s not a good feeling to look back and think, \u201cI had the perfect opportunity to study, get through college, and come out in the end with a degree I could have used to go anywhere. But because I didn\u2019t do it then, I\u2019ve lost that chance forever.\u201d <br>I\u2019d love to see new generations keep on doing and discovering and creating and inventing new and better things.

That was just so beautiful. Thank you so much Derek for doing what you do and for being who you are!<br><br>I have benefited tremendously from Veritasium over the years. Being a physicist myself (and one who spends quite a bit of time on YouTube) my feed is naturally filled with science goodies. There&#39;s you and Numberphile and Scishow and VSauce and 3Blue1Brown and so many wonderful sources of knowledge and - perhaps even more importantly - inspiration. We need inspiration to keep going. It is the fuel that keeps the flame lit and bright, and I honestly think you have been excelling at being a provider of inspiration. Can you imagine the number of people out there that you have reached and whose lives have been improved one way or another by just letting your brain chat with theirs? You do have a lot to be proud of!<br><br>I myself have tons to thank. Today you have helped to cool down my nerves a bit in the stress that comes from this whole pandemic mess. But there was another day where I was  helped by learning a neat way to explain one concept or another from your videos. And there was even another day when I was helped with some key understanding about the topic of the trial lecture I had to give to defend my own PhD (the trial lecture topic in Norway where I took my degree is chosen 2 weeks prior to the defense, and mine was on the transport of water in plants. I can&#39;t tell you how much I benefited from your video on that!) So yeah, those are a couple of concrete examples, and I am sure I am only one in a multitude of science lovers out there who have been benefiting tremendously from the privilege and joy of having folks like you as our sources of information and entertainment.<br><br>Keep doing what your heart and mind tell you you should do.

Great presentation.   You asked for suggestions about what to do with your time.  I believe there are two answers.  One answer is in helping others and thereby helping yourself.  Canadian Doctor Hans Selye who was the world&#39;s leading authority on stress, said that the key to happiness was &quot;altruistic egoism&quot; which means you help others with the knowledge that you yourself will benefit.   Personally I believe that the best way to help mankind is through genetic research which will lead to discoveries that will end disease.   The second answer is in your relationship with your children.  At the end of your life you will look back on your life and you will note that nothing is more valuable than what you did with your children as their father.   The key to that is how much love did you give them.   How much joy did you give them?  How much  advice did you give them about coping with the world so they could carry on with their own life?   When my 92 year old grandmother was dying I was alone with her and all she said was &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you&quot;.  That&#39;s what life comes down to.

You could apply that idea to everything that you learn. <br>The subjects for both ideas can be Art, technology, sociology, culture, traveling.", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T19:10:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "folkus suklof", "comment_text": "just found this channel.... thanks for these wise words @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1tFT4smd6E&amp;t=9m05s\">9:05</a> ... i dont know but it&#39;s so weird that now im 28 and a grad student in physics, and then im working on my screenplay (ILOVE MOVIE)... it just feels like im watching me in this video...", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T06:22:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dave", "comment_text": "The 1.5 k people who disliked this please buy braincells", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T06:07:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tasty Jason", "comment_text": "Damn Derek has aged", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T03:05:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kalaya S", "comment_text": "omg wait I want to study astrophysicis and film too...and like I have been wanting too for a long time...haha", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T00:29:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrMookie1960", "comment_text": "Hi Derek<br>I am a big fan and as a fellow physicist, I like to follow your latest offerings.

We have, like so many others in the world an enormous problem convincing people the clear benefits of Social Distancing in a clear, graphic, compelling and understandable way. At the moment here it is just not working. People in this country just don&#39;t get the importance, and the authorities apparently don&#39;t have the reach or the way to shape the message in an accessible way. As you are one of the better communicators with a large reach, this is kind of an appeal. Could you please put together a video that outlines the benefits of drastically reducing person-to-person contact, the consequences of not doing so.

I must say I always loved to watch your videos, but the ones that always touched me the most were those which offered additional inside on the place we all live in: Planet Earth. If it was about the physics inside of trees or gravitational effects observable here on the ground, those were the most amazing. To me. Since I know what it feels like to have kids, raise them, watch them grow and finally find to start their own life&#39;s, I also know what makes me afraid the most of. Have I brought my kids to live in a dying world? One that I too am guilty to have brought to its knees? And every day I ask myself: what can I do to change that? As an educator working with kids on a daily basis, I guess I have some influence on some kids I learn to know, but will they still heed my advice when they grow up? Will they remember my words in a couple of years? Actually, I doubt that. <br>But you, you use a modern and adequate medium to reach people all across the world with content that really matters, including kids. So how about talking more than you already did about all the things we can do to make this world a better place again? For the kids we will leave behind some day. People like you, with their appearance on one of the most beloved entertainment platforms of today&#39;s youths, have a much bigger influence on them then people like me have, despite working with them daily. And it&#39;s not that I am unpopular amongst the kids at my school, but in a couple of years they will have forgotten me. Your videos, they will stick.<br>Almost daily I meet people, young and old, who are widely unaware about many aspects that make this planet the place it is. Maybe bringing more light into the effects of things, even little ones, we can do to change the current course of climate change might be a thing?<br>That way I can at least always point to your videos when kids are asking me about the world of their future...<br>Anyway, whatever you go on to, I will always enjoy watching your videos, for me they are amongst the best things you tube has to offer.<br>Cheers, Chris from Berlin, GE...", "comment_date": "2019-11-09T18:09:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TigerTigerClose", "comment_text": "Damn, who those guys who unlike the video?

I suspect that many Veritasium viewers are like I was 50 years ago \u2014 smart, ambitious and determined to make a mark.  I went to Medical School and at the age of 30 opened my practice.  Marriage followed at 35, and a baby at 41.  It was at this pivotal point that I made the smartest decision of my life.  I promised myself that I would order my priorities in a rigid, nonnegotiable way:<br>#1. My son. I gave him a minimum of 1 hour of time devoted exclusively to him every day.  90 minutes - 2 hours was more typical, much more on weekends.  I read to him before bed for 30-45 minutes every night, with exceptions that were truly rare.  We read Dinotopia, 3 times.  Lord of the Rings twice.  Winnie the Pooh.  C.S. Lewis.  And Lots of Mark Twain, Steinbeck.  Harry Potter, of course.  Introductions to complexity theory. Wind in the Willows.  Dickins.  Tolstoy.  We even did bits of the Tao Te Ching sporadically, until he caught on to it, and read it on his own.  At age 12.  We did kitchen counter science, from simple stuff up to deriving a couple of Newtons laws of motion from kitchen experiments.  Models, tandem bike riding, skiing, martial arts (we didn&#39;t send him.  We did it with him, so he stuck to it).  And stupid, stupid games.  We made up dozens.  And we talked about anything, and everything.<br>#2. My work was almost co-#1.  I never let the quality drop.  I found that I would reschedule work for my son, but never the other way around.<br>#3. My wife.  Poor girl, but she understood.<br>#4. Everybody else.<br>My wife and I are each prone to moodiness.  Our son is the most stable, well-adjusted 29 year old I&#39;ve ever met, and the most consistently happy.  He works and excels at what he loves, and continues to pursue the activities we did when he was a kid \u2014 although he&#39;s added rock climbing and base jumping.<br>My point is, Derek, and anyone else with small children \u2014 if you want your kids to turn out happy, compassionate, intelligent and curious, and with a good social conscience, you MUST impart those qualities to them, and you MUST spend massive amounts of time with them playing and teaching.  you can&#39;t farm it out.

It&#39;s all I thought about and did when I was a kid. I currently hold a B.A. degree in Graphic Design and will graduate with a B.S. Mechanical Engineering degree in December.<br><br>The interesting part is the two disciplines have always been one and the same to me. . . I know. But it&#39;s something that&#39;s always been difficult for me to explain. It still is.<br><br>My simplest explanation is that I see Graphic Designers and Mechanical Engineers as creatives who just use different tools (&quot;medium&quot; in design-speak). The two disciplines are intentional in their goals. Each one is trying to make life better, easier and more enjoyable.<br>Graphic Design is liberating in terms of what I can imagine (great for creativity) and Mech. Eng. brings the practicality. In a way, the graphic designer in me dreams and the engineer makes those dreams come true.<br><br>More often than not formal education prescribes a person&#39;s scope of practice which is a good thing because it makes it easier for different disciplines to coexist and fit into society, but creativity is the bedrock of modern life. Most non-conformers stick out like misfits; at least initially. And I believe we are living off the work of those misfits. Galileo, Kepler and Tesla all had to break with convention at some point otherwise their discoveries may have remained secrets.<br><br>Allowing our unique experiences to permeate our creative processes is neccessary for unveiling new secrets; regardless of one&#39;s discipline.<br><br>I&#39;m admire your dedication and I&#39;m grateful for your videos.

I am so tied down in a family crises that has not yet resolved after 2 decades. Locked in.   Synchronistic - I did an audio today specifically raising the selection bias concept applying it to the uncertainty of my current situation and challenges.  Glad I am not the only person that identifies this.  Oh boy, still really emotional.  I have seen so much, and to my surprise most of it is coming true as the last 4 decades unfold.  Always alone in what I see so I reject the likelihood of its validity.  The convergence of validities now to the point at times I go from deep doubt to fear of having fundamentally failed in a terrible way because I did not have the courage and trust in what I see.  I felt dissuaded through being the only one standing where I was in what I saw at the time on so many things.  Silence and disinterest from peers can be so much more powerful in silencing the mind than open objection.  I guess the more you see, the more you see so many possibilities and cognitive uncertainty goes up.  Only in time does the robust insight reveal itself originally so tentatively held, as valid.  To think being geek is now trendy.   I have already done the modern AI as an algorithmic concept before anyone in modern times as far as I can tell.  I had a job in a government science lab at the time, and no one thought it was of any value.  Huh, the irony and I just laugh at the situation.  Really I do. I find it so funny, the irony.

When I was younger, I was a top student. While I was in high school, I was also enrolled in college. My high school was one of a kind at the time (it still might be, but I&#39;m not sure). I took legitimate college classes at a university and graduated high school with 3/4 of my BS in Electrical Engineering. I got married right after I graduated high school (yes, I&#39;m still married and I am the happiest I could ever be), and my plan was to finish my degree in the state I moved to. But, life had different plans. At the time, it was frustrating. The school I attempted to go to didn&#39;t allow online lab classes, and the physical school was over 4 hours away. There was no way it could work, and at the time, full online classes were just becoming a thing. It was impossible to finish my degree in that state, but we were stuck there due to the military. But, looking back, it was a blessing in disguise. While we lived there, I came to the realization that I did not want to be an engineer. I loved learning and I still do, but as I really thought about it, spending my life as an engineer would be a dagger in my stomach. Instead, I was forced to spend some one on one time with myself and figure out what I REALLY wanted to do with my life: art and writing. The state we lived in was Hell. I hated it. The only way I really stayed sane there (besides my wonderful husband&#39;s support) was through art and writing. My son was born, and my husband gave me the chance to stay at home with him and pursue my passions. My best friend and I began a writing project that we are now seeking agents for, and I realized my true calling in life. I can&#39;t even imagine what my life would be like if I had finished my degree. I know I would feel trapped. So many people tell me that not pursuing engineering was a mistake, that I should be more accepting of my intelligence, and that I would be getting great money as an engineer. I tell them that there is more to life than a career, more to life than personal gifts, and more to life than money. I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity and support my husband has given me. I&#39;m thankful for that frustrating point in my &quot;career&quot; as an engineer. It forced me to wait and realize I wanted something completely different out of my life. Writing has also given me a realization that I adore learning about planets and their properties, and I have a deep interest in quantum mechanics. At some point in the future, I may pursue a degree in astronomy! My writing (realistic Scifi and Fantasy) has pushed me to learn more about random topics, and your channel has helped me so much with understanding some of those concepts that I put into our books. I&#39;m excited to see that you have always had a passion for the arts too and you questioned your interest in engineering like I did. You&#39;re brilliant, and you&#39;re helping people who have gone through that &quot;I&#39;m not sure about this&quot; moment like you did. I can only hope that my life path leads me to helping people like you do.

How &#39;great&#39; is that? As an engineer and physicist it should be obvious how to do something. Apply the scientific method. Define the parameters of what it is, read the available literature, repeat some of the experiments. Understand the subject, become conversant in it (this is plugging you into the subject) and then extend the subject. For filmmaking this is not hard to figure out. You watch movies, you read scripts, you figure out what you like about certain movies, what you don&#39;t like about others-- more importantly you closely examine movies that have been esteemed for a long time (Yes that movie that is a year old seems to be pure genius, but no one will be sure about that for at least 10-20 years). Some of those old masterpieces are just okay, but many of them are brilliant. The path then isn&#39;t going to film school, it&#39;s writing scripts, acting, learning how stories work, understanding photography/cinematography. <br><br>Call up or write people doing the job you want to do, ask questions, ask for work, and now because it is so cheap, just start making movies.<br><br>This of course is for someone else; as it&#39;s too late for you. You&#39;re making &#39;great videos on your YouTube channel, making great pay, meeting great people...and you&#39;re likely to end up working for a text book company or a TV station (pray you don&#39;t).  What I&#39;ve learned in my so far failure to become a novelist is that it is more satisfying to learn how the people who do it well have done it more so than to plug into the academic angle on the subject. So figuring out by yourself, how did Charlotte Bronte did it, is (I think) much better than getting a PhD in English Lit and becoming a professor, even though it pays great, you meet a lot of great people, etc....

For me, that was English. I always excelled at it, and it felt like it was something I could accomplish. I\u2019ve had my life planned out for me by my family: undergraduate study in English Literature through to Phd followed by a career as a lecturer, professional academic, or even breaching the world of journalism. <br><br>But the problem is, it\u2019s not me. It is not where my heart lies. The very fact that I\u2019m on your channel testifies to the fact that I have at least a passing interest in the Sciences. But it runs deeper than that. I\u2019m attempting to self-teach basic calculus, I have changed my single-track for a dual-honours split with Philosophy (and subsequently taken a module in Elementary Logic, which I love), and I would rather read around scientific literature that I barely understand than engage with degree-relevant material. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m a procrastinator though, although I am. It is because I can read through a section of prose and, even after having accurately interpreted it, I don\u2019t get the same buzz that I receive when I\u2019ve understood some scientific principle or law. But your videos are what life is all about to my mind\u2014working out what our world means, how best to understand it, and communicating that insight to the largest number of people. <br><br>See, I\u2019ve come to understand that I\u2019m a scientist at heart, and always have been. I want to combine my penchant for problem-solving and abstract domains with my growing affinity with numbers, and to do so in a domain that offers tangible, practical applications for such practices. I now know what I want: a degree in physics with modules in astrophysics, then to apply to NASA. I want to be on the cutting edge of science, and to be involved in the ultimate human endeavour: cosmic exploration. While astronaut applications are extremely competitive (my specific interest), if I don\u2019t try I will never forgive myself. <br><br>I always wanted to conquer Everest, ever since my grandparents told me their stories about Sir Ranulph Fiennes, whom they both knew. But videos like these helped me to understand who I am, and who I want to be. My Everest will be the eternal vacuum which surrounds our planet. My conquest will be either achieving, or helping others to achieve feats of space exploration. <br><br>So, to wrap this up in a point: without videos likes these I wouldn\u2019t feel inspired to dare chasing that dream. As it is, I have ordered books on basic physics and maths, and I will set about turning that dream into reality.<br><br>Many thanks brother.

Its so true, everyone says to go after your dream, but I think you also have to temper that with reality.

Why is there a high chance of failure to achieve what we want to do with our lives? Just think about it. Why? Is it because we all want to be billionaires? I definitely don&#39;t think that this is what everyone wants, although most people would like it. Why do people end up doing things that they don&#39;t like? Enjoyment and living life in a positive way should be the goal, not survival, at least in the long run. We can all agree that working a 9-5 in a small office every day isnt attractive and can actually be harmful to one&#39;s health. So why do people do this? To live life? Hell no, they do it for survival, for security, and im not saying this is wrong but the conventional ways of obtaining these needs are generally hostile towards us, but we still choose them. Also, how about those who dream of drawing and painting but are trapped in academia or boring jobs? Why do they fail?

I might have a suggestion (see below heading for TLDR).<br>        This video was truly inspiring to me and really struck a chord. It would seem you and I have a similar past.  I too struggled with feeling stifled in the past due to choosing a safe path over my desired path. I have spent the past 10 years regretting the decision that I made.<br><br><br>Background:<br>        I found out in high school that I really enjoyed programming and computer science.  However, I did not believe that I was capable of achieving my goal (I grew up in a poor household, being told my entire life that I would amount to very little by those I considered friends).  So, I chose the safe and &quot;high paying&quot; route of architectural technology.  I had no passion for architecture, no creativity in the field and experience extreme depression due to a lack of purpose. For 7 years following my graduation, I sought a way of entering into the computer science field without having to go back to school (I have few mental disabilities and school is unnecessarily difficult for me due to all of its redundant rules and archaic grading structure). In 2017, I finally bit the bullet and returned to university to obtain a degree in computer science.  It has been a difficult path, but so very rewarding. While in the program, my interests have grown and honed in on AI and applying it to space application (rover course plotting, image processing, the search for ET life, etc.).  Now, I am in the process of preparing for my master&#39;s degree (via project courses in my 4th year) where I will be researching AI applications on Mars (a massive jump from my humble beginnings). <br><br><br>Suggestion:<br>        You asked for suggestions for the future of this channel.  I think there are many people just like you and me who feel they are meant for something greater/different than their current circumstance.  Maybe they want to invent something revolutionary, rise above their economic standing, or express who they are through their chosen medium.   Maybe they have something to offer to science or a certain industry, but cannot figure out how to make the correct connections. Most of them could really use an opportunity to do so. But first, they need to prove to themselves that they CAN do it and that they ARE good enough.  And that Failure does not mean the opposite. SO.... my suggestion: perhaps you could partner with some mentors and industry professionals to create opportunities for individuals to experience personal growth and help others achieve their life/career dreams. So that others don&#39;t have to experience the same difficulties in pioneering that you and I did.  This doesn&#39;t have to be a full-time thing, but a branch of your channel could be a possibility (or however you see it working).<br><br>Sorry for the long read and I hope whatever you chose to do is a step in the right direction :)<br><br>TLDR - Suggestion:<br>        perhaps you could partner with some mentors and industry professionals to create opportunities for individuals to experience personal growth and help others achieve their life/career dreams. So that others don&#39;t have to experience the same difficulties in pioneering that you and I did.

A journey that takes what is to me an eternity (and then some). It&#39;s fate, however, from the time it came into existance was to strike my eye. I literally made a physical connection to the star from which it came. It may have started before the earth was even formed, narrowly missing unknown and uncountable obstacles which could have stopped it at any time. The continents broke away and merged and broke away again. The dinosaurs rose and fell, and still it traveled. I looked up one night at just the right time to have it strike my eye, perhaps through a telescope. Billions more struck my eye which made the same journey, but each had the exact same individual destiny.

For example most birds don&#39;t sing on a scale, they&#39;re sort of untuned instruments if we look at it from a rigid musical point of view (not a musician, forgive me if I&#39;m wrong here). I suspect it&#39;s a psychological, evolutionary result, because our fingers are naturally producing those interval frequencies on a string. We don&#39;t have music that, say, uses intervals ten times shorter than we currently have, even though a violin or a special piano may play it. (of course, it would require 10 times better finger accuracy on a violin, if it can be done at all...).

My hope and dreams is to combine them. Instead of science, make fictional movies which respect science in ways most filmmakers don&#39;t.

Philanthropy - You could either go to third world countries and teach physics and maths to the kids there because the language of film is universal. People who do not know English can still understand visuals and learn a great deal. The other option is opening up a production house. You see a car is just a wagon with a motorised wheel. But it was through a series of innovations that the car has become a much more complex and useful machine. At present we can see the same evolution taking place in the Drone industry. But what about film? We know for a fact that during the studio system, there were different studios and they had different approaches to story telling. But they died down. Why? Perhaps because they did not have a powerful research team. Sadly that is the state of the affairs even now. Filmmakers are left on their own to come up with these radical ideas. There is no financial support for them. They suffer and wither and die away. I believe their are other story telling methods out there. There are other techniques available there. But somebody needs to gather these radical thinkers, these explorers and help them find these new avenues. What a great loss it is for mankind?

You found an obscure teaching method (call it teaching through failure) and I have made it a part of my teaching every day.  I literally shout at them that we do not learn through success but through failure and that is the point of your videos.  They have learned through your videos that we have to guess, guess WRONG and then our minds are open for a brief moment when we find ourselves to be WRONG...   THAT is the moment that I strike and drive the right concept into their heads.  It is much, much easier for my students to NOT TRY and then they don&#39;t have to deal with being wrong.  No one wants to be wrong... but WHEN they are wrong, and they SEE they are wrong, they are truly ready to learn.  I don&#39;t think you have taken this concept far enough in the teaching world and I am willing to bet that brain science will back up the idea that finding yourself to be WRONG will let you rewrite the universe in your head.  I know some interesting work was done with people that thought vaccines were bad, taught the truth, and then the ones that were made to feel good about themselves actually changed, but the controls still didn&#39;t go out and get their kids vaccinated.   We have to feel GOOD about learning the truth to have it stick.   <br><br>We can&#39;t make them feel stupid for having wrong concepts in their heads.  We need to celebrate the rewriting of their  understanding.  I try to do that every day.   I must warn you since you are not in the classroom...  They are getting what you and I would call &quot;dumber&quot;.   What I mean is they grasp the world they live in less and less.  This past week, I was doing a measurement lab and I gave them a box and a ruler and told them to calculate the volume of the box.  That was the precursor to calculating density (something they REALLY struggle with).    <br><br>They could not tell me the volume of a box with a ruler to measure it.   I said, &quot;length, width, height&quot; and then they would say &quot; and what do I do with that?&quot;  I can understand not knowing EM induction (hard to get them to grasp), but not knowing that the volume of a box is the length times width times height...   it boggles the mind.  (these are kids from educated, well off families in a nice school district... Poverty isn&#39;t the issue here).   <br><br>When I retire in about 6 years, I&quot;m going to start a channel &quot;crap high schoolers need to know!&quot;   The list is long and it gets longer each day.  <br><br>Again, thanks for making MY job and MY life better.  I can teach much better with a polished youtube video than talking and writing in front of the class.   Thank you for making me a better teacher.  OH and Vsauce, and smarter every day, and physics girl.  My son is constantly jumping around and say &quot;Vsauce!   Michael here!&quot;.   You guys have made learning vastly more available and teaching easier.

I have a nearly complete and detailed body of research that leads from The Big Bang to how cell phones show YouTube videos, down to the atomic scale of explanations. And partially inspired by your work, I have battled with philosophical questions on why anything from all that is worth learning, subject by subject, and how this knowledge reflects on the human experience. I do writing, animation, editing and all the boring stuff; I hate being the one in the limelight.

I too have always been more interested in fields completely unrelated to my career path at the time, and although I love and am proud of what I have accomplished to date, I understand the feeling of wanting more.

Once I graduated with my BA from a great school, I decided to make a risky move and educate myself to become a firefighter/EMT. It has been a long and arduous road to get where I am, and although I am now established and successful as a firefighter and learning every day how to better help people, I feel the need to push for more. Now I&#39;m considering going back to school to become an MD... <br><br>I&#39;ve said everything above to lead to this point. Your videos have inspired me to constantly strive for more knowledge, and I&#39;m sure they have done the same for countless others.

Publicity comes with a cost and the more mindless the consumers are, to more they are willing to give &quot;power&quot; (money) to individuals that will do as I previously stated: promote ignorance and support abuses. This may elude everyone, but I think you know that morality is subjective, but I have created a way to allow every ndividual to become a better version of themselves by simply looking at a compass I have created about it. How much time and efforts did it take you to become a good person that is loving and caring? How many failures and attempts? We can teach that to avoid losing people to the current american system and becoming more like the current president... that is clueless and says random things that offer only an impression. Ignorant people will like the sound of it and follow... You know the drill.. So what regulates &quot;progress&quot; (the one that this society perceives as progress/technology) -&gt; morality. There are countless things I could say to persuade you, but the truth is... we dont even care about the difference of these three words: &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;logic&quot; and what makes &quot;sense&quot;... their roots are helpful to get an insight, but even thelanguage is a tool that was created for abuse... nearly never to actually communicate a clear idea (ideal purpose = communication as opposed to expression that is often used to gain something personally by offering an impression then confuse). We hope that the reference in the mind of the interlocutor is the same, but we can hardly know if they understood unless we ask them to repeat in their own words... a rather tedious process.<br><br><br>Before I continue, I would like to thanks all your attempts to teach people that are willing to listen, but that will not be enough (read of if you are interested, but this is directed to our dear publisher.<br>I&#39;m wondering if you could reach out so that I give the world a way to save itself by influencing millions... suggesting a direction... not imposing it. For the messages to offer the credibility they need, I can&#39;t be behind the whole structure, but the tool I want to provide will allow people to create real communities to discuss... your videos or leave the comfort of their home to find the relationships we all want. The webtool will be the most accessible thing (free) and will eradicate the first cause for depression and the &quot;feeling&quot; of loneliness (&amp; loneliness) as it will provide the fastest human answer. By another human. I&#39;ve worked on several principles that allow us to have exponential results without disrupting to any natural &quot;flows&quot; since I&#39;ve confined the parameters of the brain and nature. I dont think I want to disclose any of it because it takes time to perceive what can&#39;t be seen and I&#39;d be shooting myself in the foot if I were to foolishly makes such claims. <br>Do like the users do here and drop a message /add me somewhere. ishibim <br>I do treat catfish in kindness (irony, for the numbnuts). <br>I was born during this era of abuse and have been gathering data to solve issues that affect us all, but that nobody would burden himself with... nor gvts or companies are willing to tackle. You have the perspective to relate to these facts so I&#39;m asking you to chat with me. I don&#39;t need anything from you, but... my boredom made me interested in solving it all, but I cannot be associated with any of it for the sake of its credibility. The truth should be self-explanatory as it can be repeated without creating negative ripples. Hopefully you understand this metaphor. <br><br>Take good care, Derek.

Who knows how well any of this will translate to this visual medium, however, you&#39;ve been a great &#39;translator&#39; so far.

But satisfaction rarely becomes contentment, and that&#39;s a grace.  That keeps us going without having to question where we are going or why.  Actually achieving contentment, though, is the worst thing that can happen to someone who wants to work and fight, or who feels that they must work and fight to justify their existence.  At some point, you have to decide: is contentment something you really work and fight to achieve, or is contentment the excuse you use to justify your desire to work and fight?  If contentment is something you work and fight to achieve, you can stop working and fighting, as soon as you achieve it.  Maybe it will stay with you, with minimal maintenance, or maybe it won&#39;t.  But, if you really were working and fighting to be content, and you are content, you might as well enjoy that for as long as you can.  But, if contentment was only ever a MacGuffin to drive the plot of your hero&#39;s journey, then destroy it as soon as you get it.  Become a tragic hero-- your own worst enemy, since you&#39;ve defeated all the others.  Be a fool just to prove the value of your wisdom.  Get weak just to prove your strength.  Destroy all of the value you&#39;ve created in your life, so that you have hope of redemption.  You have to decide what the thesis of your life&#39;s narrative will be, and what kind of story it will be.  It does not have to be an interesting story, unless you insist that it must be.  It can be interesting at first, and then just become horribly boring.  Or, it can be horribly interesting from start to finish.  The more interesting you want it, the more tragedy you must involve in the narrative.  It&#39;s all up to you, and you are responsible only to yourself for how you live your life.  Everyone else will live their lives, too, until we are all gone like the dinosaurs, and only the birds  remain.", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T23:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Brown", "comment_text": "You should go on &#39;Hot Ones&#39;.

It always helps to see that even the ones who really succeeded had a lot of ups but more importantly a lot of downs. I hope from now on you will only have tons of ups though.

I know how people keep asking for representation, and it truly only made sense to me today.<br><br>I was an above average student myself and was granted a scholarship for engineering in my city, in Pakistan. Although I had a passion for film making, I never took it serious as a career choice. And after completing one year, in 2012, as Malala, the noble peace laureate was attacked by the Taliban, so was I, a few months before her. It changed my life as I had to drop out of college. Long story short I took a gap year and made a couple of films, that were really a huge hit in my city and community, especially on my activism channel on YouTube. Most specifically because it was somewhat autobiographical. As it encouraged terror stricken kids to not give up on education.<br><br>After a year or reapplying, I was given an admission in one of the top Engineering universities in Pakistan. As I completed my bachelor&#39;s however, I bored out of it. I&#39;m no longer interested in the dull chips anymore. I&#39;ve graduated more than 6 months ago, and have applied for Engg jobs.

That&#39;s amazing! Throughout the video, I had a constant smile on my face. I realised it when the video was finished. I have been watching your videos continuously since I don&#39;t know when (could be from ~2011). It&#39;s amazing because the photons and phonons you have recorded will be there forever as long as the human race will survive. Its amazing because of the emotions you put to analyse those zeroes and ones and expressed them wholeheartedly. Indeed, I was missing your videos but the recent non-digital accomplishments of yours bring tons of joy to us who have been constantly inspired by you. The evolution of my scientific journey and me as a human being has been nurtured by several important people. Some of them are long gone before I was even born. I had to read their equations from some bad teachers, although, later reading their papers was a delight because I knew them those bad teachers. But among a few who are of my lifetime, I am glad to hearing and seeing one of them (that&#39;s you) continuously due to YouTube. Thanks for coming to my life and introducing several various things to it. I do not believe in academic degrees. Having degrees in several completely different subjects of science, I have a strong interest in art and music on which I do not have any degrees. Similar to currency we have invented degrees to quantify our abilities which are simply not quantifiable, I believe. So, thanks for inspiring not only just me once again but also to those who are just starting their academic career. I think this is a video which must be shown to all the undergraduates in their first year.

I am one of those college kids you mentioned,  just finished film school and moved to los angeles. <br><br>I recall I sent you an email once about becoming involved with science communication, and you challanged me to write a script for an episode. This stumped me, because my strength was in visual communication, not writing. At the time, I got bummed out and gave up. However, that failure stuck with me. <br><br>My senior year of college I took a &quot;writing for TV&quot; class, where we were challenged to write episodes for new/existing shows. This was right around the time that Mindfield had come out, so I took the chance to try my hand at writing an episode. To my surprise I found a lot of joy in researching a topic to the fullest extent that I could, and fitting the data inside a digestible and entertaining format.<br><br>If it hadn&#39;t been for the way that you prompted me and challenged me, I might never have tried  my hand at writing an episode, and learning new things along the way. So I wanted to say thank you for that.<br><br>Which brings me to my next bit: you have a strong platform and brand for science communication, something you didnt have when you were young and new to the industry. Would you consider using your platform for other passionate science communicators, where you control the quality of content, but provide those withat an audience the brand?<br><br>Another idea, is in relation to your newfound family values.

I ended up majoring in German literature...which...is another passion of mine, but the question still exists: how am I going to get from a degree in literature to be able to surround myself with Biology and science? <br>It&#39;s still something I&#39;m trying to figure out, but it seems like I am at a pivotal point in my life. I now live in Germany (I can live and breathe German everyday now instead of just in the classroom) and...I recently was accepted to a program to study Biology (in German, bless my soul). Up until now, it was a very difficult path, facing my own trials and tribulations, failure, speculation from those I&#39;ve surrounded myself, etc etc...and I think I&#39;ve maybe only come this far because I was (and still am) ignorant to how massive and difficult my dreams are to achieve. <br><br>I hate when people say &quot;just follow your dreams.&quot; It&#39;s a pretentious mantra that, as you said, doesn&#39;t take into consideration how many others have failed trying to achieve the same thing...but it&#39;s simple: if you don&#39;t try, then you don&#39;t have any chance of success. Having stability is great, but I didn&#39;t want that and I knew, in the direction that I wanted to go, that stability doesn&#39;t exist (or at least not yet). <br><br>So, anyways...thank you for your awesome videos! And for clarifying misconceptions! And for educating us on science! And thank you for being the inspiration that I, and others, need(ed).", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T10:59:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "giveussomevodka", "comment_text": "You got fat.", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T10:58:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mark Smit", "comment_text": "I normally don&#39;t do thumbs up.

The ability to tell a story about any subject and cause a stranger to come away with a positive introspective outlook is the hallmark of a master, in my opinion. Well done, and thanks.<br><br>   Personally, I think we are beginning to see a shift towards more direct scientific communication. I think we are about to see entities like NASA and USGS invest in communication and education through places like YT. I think FB has permanently altered it&#39;s market share due to it&#39;s recent misgivings, and that just leaves YT. There are a handful of people that could really take something like a NASA YT channel and turn it into something much bigger than anything we can imagine. I&#39;d like to see someone take on a challenge like this. Imagine the potential if someone had broad spectrum NASA access with the sole purpose of creating educational content. If you had the authority to pull people away for a few minutes at a time when needed, broad scale access, and an open and simple directive with open creative license, I think the potential is enormous. In my opinion, the future is science telling the science story instead of the story of science getting told through an unaffiliated third or fourth party filter.

It&#39;s not like humans are incapable of wrapping their minds around that sort of thing, though; I, personally, have no problem with it, and I sometimes find it difficult to deal with people who don&#39;t. (Unfortunately, I never did get that math education, so physics research isn&#39;t for me at this point in my life.) I realized, though, that kids don&#39;t have a decade or more of experience with the low-energy macroscopic world to get in the way. What exists in their imaginations is just as real as the room in which they&#39;re sitting. Little kids should be able to grasp ideas like four-dimensional spacetime and spooky action at a distance just like they pick up their parents&#39; language or the rules of whatever obscure variant of tag their neighborhood tends to play.<br><br>So, there&#39;s my idea. Something about teaching physics like you have been for all this time, and something for your kids, and for others.

Like a Snopes for research-driven changes that may be very beneficial or very harmful if carried out by the general public without adequate understanding of the how to apply primary research.  An example of this would be the research &quot;findings&quot; that were released about vaccines and autism (I&#39;m not trying to argue one way or the other here, just using the verified facts from that incident as an example). If there was a source that people could look to to explain the main research that was released and find out that it was totally unreliable and biased and influenced by personal financial benefit before it was released I feel like we wouldn&#39;t be fighting the dangerous anti-vaccine movement that we are today.

I&#39;ve always been curious of these sorts or things because it&#39;s like half of a &quot;full dive gear&quot; that you see in science fiction anime/movies. The only thing it&#39;s missing is to inject data into the brain where you can imagine rather then see it on a screen. Also if they were to fully research it they could perhaps record dreams for you. I love to daydream and sleep mainly because of the adventures i go on but at the end it always gets fuzzy and since i also like to write, it&#39;d be a very helpful tool to playback a dream that was just soo...active? I can&#39;t think of one specific word but i&#39;d say active has so many connotations that it&#39;d fit best for now. I&#39;d also like to put out there that 90% of my writing ideas come from dreams.

The issue here is that the methods of learning more in business and engineering are not exactly what I feel I&#39;m comfortable with? What I mean is how some people are practical learners, others can absorb information by reading about it. It was only a level two engineering course but some aspects of course work didn&#39;t particularly appeal to me, specifically some coursework that required researching materials to make a bracket out of, the requirement to use paper based resources then computer based resources to back up the choice of material made from the paper based resources. From what I&#39;ve found out about a business course, it would be something similar, only it would be visiting a business, taking notes about it&#39;s different aspects, eg. marketing etc, and creating documents talking about it. These are things that I&#39;m not comfortable with and why I&#39;ve reached a point where I don&#39;t know what to do as a next step. <br>Oh, and it requires a huge amount of money with the potential to not be the most profitable in the current market of the UK (where I am). :(<br>3 things I&#39;d like to achieve (but are very much daydreaming at the moment) are;<br>1. Have my own business which builds and installs gates for driveway with a different design and operation to some I&#39;ve seen around. (Boring, I know).<br>2. Have a garage business with a large area of private property to have an area where car enthusiasts can enjoy their cars without being a nuisance on public roads.<br>3. Have a biofuel production company, international, with an idea that I&#39;ve seen on YouTube (I&#39;d try and have a partnership  with those who came up with the idea, not steal it) so that a renewable energy source can be produced in the quantity required to run everything that currently runs off fossil fuels so that the infrastructure currently in place can continue to be used, without having to convert every aspect of it to electric, therefore saving the country a lot of money, I&#39;d assume in the millions at least. I don&#39;t know the exact values but if every car in the UK was to be swapped for an electric one and the average annual mileage was covered by them all, I calculated (very roughly) that the country&#39;s electricity production would need to almost double. I would assume that the installation of offshore wind farms would be in the millions, not including the cost of the hundreds of thousands of public charging points needed for all spaces in public car parks and on street parking, and all of this is just for cars. If the quantity of biofuel can be produced to fuel all of today&#39;s technology to power tomorrow&#39;s world.

I did military training for 11 months after school and then into work life. After doing a little of what was needed wherever i got into a short time vocational education in automation engineering which i almost finished. I got a job in the field of service and support for a company that works with systems used on commercial cargo ships and then it went on for a few years. The company had to cut down and I got fired. After a while of doing a little here and there for local companies, i took a job of taking care of people with demensia for a year to get some stability. This ended and I got into doing development and maintaining a website and webmail for a medium sized site. It was a struggle every month and when i got asked to do an installation on a ship for an automation system, i quickly said yes. This resulted in me doing retrofit of automation systems on LNG carriers for 10 years before i got tired of being away from my family so much and had to make a drastical change. I quit and then our main supplier, Siemens, called med and told me to call a number. I called them and got employed even as they were not looking for personnel in the area i lived. As the company is a partner with Siemens in many areas, i could continue work with Siemens software and do a lot of work with developing them. The experience i have gotten doing my job have made me one of the most experienced in Scandinavia with Siemens SIMIT, PCS7 and COMOS as with the integration of these softwares to build a digital representation of plants and factories.<br><br>I am just a grunt.

I doubt that you will read this comment but I&#39;ll still give it a shot, If you do hopefully it makes you smile. Ever since I discovered you on YouTube, a certain passion emerged within myself. I have always been a curious kid, but as we all grow up that &quot;child curiosity&quot; tends to fade away. At one point I felt that it was fading away but you saved me from a life rather empty, a life without science, wonder and amazement. Through you I discovered a world of science and the scientific community of YouTube, it changed me. From the narrow minded bullied kid I was, on a small Island in the Indian Ocean, I became so passionate about the world around me to a point that I wanted something more from life. I took my future between my hands, it was set, I was to be a scientist.  I worked really hard and managed to obtain a scholarship in Australia, to study Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology. So many different fields interested me but as you know choices need to be made. I am hopefully leaning towards a PhD and hope to merge Robotics with my field of knowledge in the future. <br><br>Thank you so much again for changing my life!!<br>~ A kid in a wonderful world.<br><br>P.S: I can&#39;t wait to see you the 30th of July in Perth for your talk on Vitamania!

I grew up strangely. I love learning and sharing what I have learned. Those around me were not enamored with me. My older sister and the neighborhood girls used to include me in their play and then soon I found my self all alone. What was happening was my sister was required to be engaged in play with me for a minimum amount of time. She and her friends met the requirement after which they would go away and hide from me.<br>I was born in 1955 and many things known to medical science today was not known then. I would learn 45 years later, I was born with a condition now called Asperger\u2019s syndrome. I do not read faces and thus did not understand social cues. I did not understand I overwhelmed my sister and her friends. <br>As an adult after I had achieved my MD and finished my Psychiatric residency, I had a conversation with my older sister about these events of our childhood did I learn why she and the others fled me. My sister said it was like interacting with a 7 yo who was going on 23 yo. I constantly sounded like an adult. <br>The problem was it led me to being even less socialized. But my mother was aware of my difficulties and tried different things to guide me. The first of which was to hold my head in a position during a conversation and explain I must make eye contact while engaged in the conversation. This non eye contact is one of the things quite common about this neurological syndrome. Later she insisted I take the speech classes that high school offered. I then added as much communication courses I could in College. I was one course short of a Minor in Communications when I was graduated with my BS Chemistry (honors) degree. (I went on to medical school so I did not finish the Minor).<br>I had tools to use to do the job as a Psychiatrist.<br>Your YouTube channel helped me in my time of need. In 2005, I experienced bacterial meningitis with two strokes. This led to my forced retirement. You Dr Mueller provided my kind of entertainment. At home, away from the job I had made for myself was really not what I had planned for my 50\u2019s.<br>You have brought joy to my life doing what you love.", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T15:36:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Yap", "comment_text": "This is so beautiful!

I think you have one of the most interesting views of science among the science youtubers or community here, and you have earned that status by hard work and following your passion (even thou is not always the best advice by itself, the passion ignites things after they have started). Now i encounter myself in a situation that you already know, as i write this comment i&#39;m waiting with my wife the arrival of our baby, in his last week in the womb, so we are a little anxious but at the same time in a static happiness that is to receive another human being that has become from the decisions and actions you have taken. To me, that fact that you haven&#39;t uploaded something doesn&#39;t bother me much, i use this platform to learn or enjoy things that people have dedicated time and energy to explain, in a way that maybe the same Richard Feynman did it, in a fun and constructive way, for the sake and the pleasure of knowing things. But you know that this pleasure is not only that, and in science there is a bigger reward maybe, not in terms of money, but in a deep sense of awe. That&#39;s incredible that we can share along the world, but i think that maybe there are somethings that needs to be understood in their context, specially in their historical and sociological context, why there is a revolution in content aimed to science and people wanting to know. Maybe there is something that not many people has done in youtube, mixing history and science in a way that explains how a discovery may even change the language we use.<br>Best regards from Chile!", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T15:27:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Luca Distefano", "comment_text": "Veritasium makes me sound smart with my friends", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T15:27:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mih\u00e1ly Unatenszki", "comment_text": "Keep it up, Derek!

This is an invitation to see a theory on the nature of time! In this theory we have an emergent uncertain future continuously coming into existence relative to the spontaneous absorption and emission of photon energy. Within such a process the wave particle duality of light and matter in the form of electrons is forming a blank canvas that we can interact with forming the possible into the actual! The future is unfolding with each photon electron coupling or dipole moment relative to the atoms of the periodic table and the wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum. As part of a universal process of energy exchange that forms the ever changing world of our everyday life the \u2018past\u2019 has gone forever. At the smallest scale of this process the \u2018past\u2019 is represented by anti-matter annihilation with the symmetry between matter and anti-matter representing the symmetry between the future and the past as the future unfolds photon by photon. In such a theory the mathematics of quantum mechanics represents the physics of \u2018time\u2019 with the classical physics of Newton representing processes over a period of time, as in Newton\u2019s differential equations.

I also happened to be taking electronics, so it was nothing to splice the two wires back together, and they worked good as new.  However, I cut the wires again later on in those years.  For some reason, the splicing didn&#39;t work.  I did notice a coating on the wires.  (Copper wires aren&#39;t supposed to be green.)  But this is where it gets interesting...  I removed the coating from the tips of the ends of the wires by sanding them down, tried splicing them again, but the headphones still wouldn&#39;t work!  I also noticed some clear, very thin, fibrous strands that ran the length of the wire, but while fiber optics were certainly being looked at for electronic uses, I&#39;m (somewhat sure?) that they weren&#39;t yet practical for stereo headphones.
