There is no carbon dating to determine this, but there is water erosion evidence on the sphinx. The amount of rain it would need to give it the erosion it shows puts it in a different time, with a different climate. The granite stones in the pyramid cannot be cut to that precision with any type of copper chisel, regardless of how much time you invest. There was no evidence of any tombs or bodies, it was completely sealed up as if by design. There are some inconspicuous writings about Khufu above the &quot;Kings&quot; chamber by the huge granite columns, but some people say that this was forged by the first explorer into the great pyramid to <b>legitimize</b> his funding. Every part of this pyramid when studied from a mechanics standpoint show it being a reactor or some type of power plant. Each &quot;shaft&quot; in the &quot;Queen&quot; chamber shows evidence of zinc oxide and an acid type for the 2nd shaft. What was found all over the room on the walls they theorized was the result of combustion, but was cleaned away. Each shaft had metallic diode like connectors when explored by the German scientists in the 90s. Christopher Dunn&#39;s book &quot;The Giza Power Plant&quot; states this union of chemicals would form hydrogen gas and would travel up the grand gallery while getting amplified by a multitude of resonators while leading to Kings chamber. Inside there what happened is a mystery, but he believes the energy was amplified even more and directed out the shafts in those rooms which lead to the outside air. The shafts have been verified to be like tuned tubes, like what are used for microwave waveguides. Something else he doesn&#39;t mention is that the construction of the pyramid is like an insulated circuit would be. Highly conductive stones on the inside (red granite) with an outdoor limestone, and the white limestone casing which had very little conductive properties. It will take your mind on a ride because it makes more sense than the conventional argument. One thing I&#39;m sure of though: these pyramids were NOT built in the time period they state, and not by the Egyptian people. I believe they merely settled there seeing this land as divine. People like Zawass and other egyptologists fight back vehemently against any other view because they think it threatens their careers. Partially it would make them seem stupid. This is the problem.

Firstly we have never found a single Egyptian copper saw big enough to cut a single block. When people have actually tried cutting these blocks with copper saws, water and sand it takes days to cut an inch. The cuts are also unbelievably precise - you can observe this inside the pyramids themselves when you see the rocks perfectly flush with each other. Copper swords cutting with sand cannot achieve this precision. <br>We also have to remember that to build the Giza pyramid in the suggested 20year timespan a block has to be cut, positioned perfectly every 5mins, 24 hours a day for 20 years. The sides of the Giza pyramid are aligned as precisely as our modern laser guided methods produce. Place one single block wrong and the walls of the pyramid would not align as as perfectly as they do. They did this in 5 mins (or less if they didn\u2019t work non-stop) with human labor and copper tools? Hmm\u2026<br><br>The problem with the copper saw hypothesis is it was invented by Egyptologists with no engineering or building knowledge.

That explanation doesn&#39;t require wacky aliens or lost civilization tech but does credit the builders with much more knowledge than we do, it&#39;s the best explanation to account for the erratic shapes of the blocks and the way they&#39;re assembled perfectly with no cement, that goes double for the temple of the Sphinx where we find stones up to 500 tons perfectly assembled despite their shapes that defy logic. You find visual proof of that on certain blocks on the ground level of the Great Pyramid on which we see &quot;lips&quot; like the kind we get when some liquid mixture escapes a mold before hardening. We can also see mold prints on blocks above 50m where the sandy winds don&#39;t reach and couldn&#39;t polish the blocks. That also explains how they managed to perfectly line up those 70 tons granite blocks inside the &quot;king&#39;s chamber&quot; lifted about 70m above the ground (which we&#39;d be hardly capable of even with cranes). And if that wasn&#39;t enough did you take a look at the blocks that fell in the sand ?

As for ramps, I don&#39;t see why they needed ramps in the first place, but they had a lot of sand in the desert, first I would lay the first layers of stones, then I would add sand to everything until everything is level again, then the second layer, and so on.<br>You really don&#39;t need to be a genius to come up with that...<br>You can also split even granite with salt, water and heat, which was there in abundance.

First put the blocks on those wooden rollers in place, attach the balloons, then surround it by sand, fill up with water, add sand in the water so the water level rises, and keep adding sand and surround it by sand so the water can&#39;t escape, until the blocks are high enough, then dig away the surrounding sand so the water can be drained, and there you go, a block that was once down below, is now 100 meter higher, just make sure the surroundings are thick enough, but they could dam it in, and down below even create a gate, I could draw it all for you, but as usual, people just won&#39;t take me seriously, so I doubt you&#39;d be interested.

This is because  the pyramids were used to indicate solstices and equinoxes. The pyramid is located at 29 degrees, 58 minutes, 51.06 seconds north latitude, and 31 degrees, 9 minutes, and 0.0 seconds east longitude. It marks the Spring Equinox due to the angle of the sides of the pyramid vs. its latitude, it casts no shadow at noon during the spring equinox. The Great Pyramid of Giza is aligned True North by being the most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error. The position of the North Pole moves over time and the pyramid was probably exactly aligned at one time. Also The Great Pyramid is located at the center of the landing mass of the earth. The east/west parallel that crosses the most land and the north/south meridian that crosses the most land intersect in two places on the earth, one in the ocean and the other at the Great Pyramid.

Factor in they did not live 80 years and closer to 40 and your at 8 million people doing nothing but sawing 12 hours a day for 40 years. Given they could start sawing at 5 and were too old to saw 35-40 do to hard labor for 30 years and your at about 10 million peoples lifetimes. And that&#39;s running at max efficiency when it comes to cutting the entire time. I&#39;m sure moving them miles and miles was much much harder and up the pyramid even harder than that. Now factor in the population was on 1 mil. Just cutting the stone with their entire population would have taken over 400 years. Now logical speaking a max of 1/10th of their population could truly only cut since the rest were for wars food or making tools and transferring the stones etc. Which is more than fair. Itd take them 4000 years under the best of conditions to build one pyramid. It&#39;s estimated their population reached a max of 3mil. So at the best it&#39;d still take 1000 years. But at the very least 2500 years+ that&#39;s at blocks that are 4 feet high. Some were more than 6 feet. Which would drastically increase the time.

Besides the pyramids, there are abundant examples of high level engineering and precision machining on both small and massive industrial scales, in granite, diorite and other extremely hard materials, all over Egypt. When viewed as a whole, this body of work gives the powerful impression of having been easy, routine, not difficult. The idea of brute force labor and copper tools is one that engineers who visit Egypt laugh at, before they begin speculating in engineering terms on how these works could have been designed and manufactured. The dolerite pounders idea of quarrying granite is idiotic and has been conclusively debunked by Christopher Dunn and others. It quite simply is impossible. For example, you cannot hold onto a dolorite ball while striking granite for very long, because the impact shock will be transmitted into your hand, and injure it fairly quickly. So you need to let go shortly before impact, at which point the ball can take off in a random direction. Similarly, if you use the pounders as scrapers, you can remove even less material. Furthermore, the Unfinished Obelisk is deeply undercut. Nobody can explain how diorite pounders could have been used to cut sideways in that fashion. Again, impossible. There are square holes in the trench with sharp corners. How they could have been cut with ball-shaped pounders is unknown. This guy is very good when he is within areas of proven expertise, but in Egypt he is definitely out of his lane. His method is to appeal to expert authority, which works in many areas of science, but in Egypt, the so-called experts have less credibility by the day, while engineers and others with technical backgrounds discuss the tools and methods that were absolutely necessary to perform the work. Archaeologists insist that steel was never used, because steel tools have not been found, yet, if their dating is wrong, and if the ancient works are far older, on the order of 10,000 plus years, as both geologists and oral traditions agree, then the chances of finding remnant tools becomes vanishingly small. The more plausible story is that the dynastic Egyptians inherited these works, and claimed them as their own. We see much the same in ancient Peru, where multiton, polygonal megalithic stonework joined with virtually airtight precision has been attributed to the Inca, much of whose own demonstrated work is far inferior, and where once again, ancient oral traditions speak of inheritance of the sites.", "comment_date": "2021-07-14T22:33:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "4 4 Cartel", "comment_text": "I have been working as a stonemason now for around 9 years.

Several advanced ancient civilizations existed before ours. Earth&#39;s history has not developed linearly.

These disasters are causing a huge tidal wave, floods, earthquakes, volcano eruptions and a bombardment of fiery meteors. Some animals become extinct, mankind hardly survives. These disasters create a cycle of civilizations. Four civilizations live a &#39;short&#39; period of time and are not numerous. One civilization lives much longer and becomes more numerous. The last longer living civilization vanished 20,000 years ago because of the next recurring, thus predictable, disaster. Near the end of their existence, they were higher developed than our civilization today. To tell us that they existed, they constructed huge monuments like the Great Pyramid in Egypt and other huge constructions around the world. And they constructed survival places mostly high in the mountains. As Machu Picchu in Peru. The only possible cause of such a cycle of disasters can be the ninth planet of our solar system that comes close to the sun and its planets every few thousand years.

They caught the ruling power and put the lion people into torture camps and slavery. It was another country that fell victim to the second wave of loss of power of the lion people who ruled the entire world at that time. Moses liberated some lions and brought to a hilly area called Israel as Yudew (Jews). Looking at the history of Sri Lanka, about 1200 years after the incident, the Lions people gradually resurfaced. Later Alexander the Great liberated the lion people imprisoned in various kingdoms scattered throughout the world. But one of his main target, getting the royal families of lion people in north India ( Lord Buddha&#39;s relatives)  free was failed before the cruelty of then king Karawala and giving the war up for the sake of lives of imprisoned people. Later they were liberated by Emperor Dewanampiyathisa then King of Lanka the land of origin of lion people, through his colony king Dharma Asoka. Pharaoh never built pyramids. Pyramids were built because lion people can&#39;t build water reservoirs in desert unlikely in Sri Lanka. Water reservoirs, as well as Pyramids, activate some nuclear process on the land is a big help for maintaining the levitation power of spiritual lives of lion people(flying lions or Yaksha or Isi).<br>Our question is how the giant stones were raised to build the pyramids?<br><br>These lion men can activate their spiritual bodies so that to create a living bubble or some sort of balloon. Simply put, they transform themselves into tiny planets.  They are called Isi or Giri in Hela language.  In Sanskrit, it is Yaksha and Rahath in pali language. This transforming process was carried out by using a cloud of electrons, a stream of protons and the natural nuclear binding energy emitted by the sun. Natural nuclear binding energy is called &quot;Ra&quot; in Hela language. Where the &quot;Ra&quot; energy emits is called &quot;Ira&quot; in Hela language, and its sun in English.  Actually, it&#39;s a nuclear process. I do not like to disclose secrets further at this moment but to say that the process initiates with speeding up the spinning of electron cloud called &quot;Ma&quot; in Hela language. Now the gravity of the earth does not affect this tiny planet or the spiritual bubble. Then the man in the balloon can fly freely into the sky. In this case, they manipulated the extremely small amount of nuclear binding energy in the spiritual body to activate the antigravity force. (Compare with the Einstein equation E= mc2). The presence of the Sphinx statue confirms the existence of Yakshas or flying lions. It is said in the folklore of Sri Lanka at that time that the sky in the city of Anuradhapura was darkened due to the ascension of about 40,000 Yakshas at one time after receiving their degree in Giri. The other thing is Giri degree holders are Extremely intelligent. When two bubbles like this, or two Yakshas, come close together, a larger bubble-like balloon free from gravity can be formed.  Even if a large rock is inserted into the balloon, it will not fall down because the gravity of the Earth will not affect it.  This is how the pyramids were built by the flying lions or Yaksha people. Not only on pyramids but studying the folklore on Stonehenge in the UK reveals the same theory. If someone needs to solve the mysteries in the ancient world such as Egyptian Mayan Roman Indian or Greek he must study the ancient history of Sri Lanka first. The other thing is that even though flying lions or Yakshas are maintained in other countries, they can only be produced in Sri Lanka. Be careful reading current history books because of misinterpretations done by foreign scholars who do not know the language well.", "comment_date": "2021-02-15T00:36:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emmanuel", "comment_text": "U are soo inteligent but still a sheep using the &quot;conspiration theory&quot; in order to discard the thinking", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T23:17:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leo Zheng", "comment_text": "The dispensable drain formerly check because cost traditionally talk following a energetic hydrogen. equable, spectacular stamp", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T19:58:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "slow glider", "comment_text": "It&#39;s made of yellow cement", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T13:16:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac Weiser", "comment_text": "Since people don&#39;t know how the pyramids were built I&#39;ll spill the beans the Jewish colony built it as a punishment from God they were kept in egypt for over 400 years untill god decided it was time to take them out of egypt so he brought 12 plagues untill the pharoh decided to let them out", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T00:26:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abbadingo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lotbZQ55SgU&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a>.

The rubber plant is the most prevalent natural resource in Brazil, and they used it to form their balloons.\r<br>The two air shafts, on the sides of the pyramid, were used to create a vacuum, to suck in the air. The air was then collected in a bubble, under the pyramid, then released into the main shaft, which blew the air out the top.\r<br>Here, we see King Pakal seated in his basket, looking up at the stars, which they used for navigation. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/70791759/Mayan-Astronaut\">https://www.behance.net/gallery/70791759/Mayan-Astronaut</a> \r<br>The Mayans were the original Pharaohs of Egypt.", "comment_date": "2020-08-09T13:25:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alsa Alsa", "comment_text": "Hi!

If you remember what Archimedes told us, you will realize that a submerged stone is subject to a buoyancy force which reduces its apparent weight, so if a waterway is available it makes sense to move submerged stones wit attached buoyancy.<br>Another assumption which is almost always made is that ramps were used.  Moving a stone up a ramp is not easy.  It&#39;s easier to use leverage and flip a  cuboidal stone over another stone like it already in place.<br>Another assumption made that always struck me as being highly simplistic is that the labour force were slaves, and were directed by priests.

You&#39;re saying yourself that a stone was set every 3 minutes. Assuming you need 30, 40 or 50 men for a single stone, how would you imagine this using a single ramp? Also, why would they use big stones rather than small ones if this wasn&#39;t visible from the outside once the pyramid was finished? Why was the big pyramid steeper than others? I would assume this was all out of practical reasons. They simply attached ropes to those stones. The rope then went up the pyramid to a log, and redirected down again. The workers walked up the pyramid (gaining potential energy), then pulled down the ropes, which pulled up the stones. The stones were chosen as large as possible to maximize efficiency. Too small and you&#39;re wasting space and workers, too large and it gets impossible logistically. The blocks were 2 tons or so, and so 50 or 60 heavy workers could pull the blocks up by walking down. It doesn&#39;t seem particularly far fetched. You could easily imagine someone with a rope, throwing it over a branch of a tree and pulling on it. They did also find a mechanism to shut the king&#39;s chamber with a large stone, that was based on ropes and redirecting forces on logs. In my understanding, for a large pyramid, this is the only way that makes any sense at all, and it is quite a simple idea too.", "comment_date": "2020-04-01T20:30:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "harshhologram1111", "comment_text": "How come you never hear of white people building gigantic monuments like the pyramids around the world??

Even mohanjodaro or harappan bricks and houses are all broken but still after 5000 yeara the stones of egypt remains intact it shows tge usage of materials.

The nation of Egypt represents rebellion and evil in the bible.  Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.  Before Moses, men were trying to build a tower to reach heaven and they would have probably done it if God did not put a stop to it.  How were they able to do that?  Why would we try to use our own understanding of how they would build these pyramids when the bible shows that people back then were in another realm of understanding than we are today?  Pharaoh relied on his magicians to challenge the miracles of God, which shows how valuable high level magic was to him and his nation back then.   I believe the pyramids were built before the flood as it looks like there was a lot of water erosion on them, but it&#39;s possible they were built after.  Either way, it was likely through sorcery since they were placed in Egypt.<br><br><br><br>Before you get excited or interested in magic let me remind you that God killed Pharaoh and his armies.

These angel human hybrids were Giants. This is recorded across almost all antediluvian civilizations.

Sounds fantastic to us modern inculcated dumb masses but there is evidence all over the world of such Giants.

Most people, especially those of us who want truth would do well to read the history in the Old Testament. It\u2019s TRUTH and it\u2019s the very reason GOD flooded the earth. All flesh had become corrupted from the fallen angels and their angel human hybrid offspring. There is so much more to these pyramids than them serving as tombs for crying out loud. Anyone who actually applies their mind should see that modern so called science is a joke and nobody should take these terrible explanations as plausible. These huge granite stones survived the flood and the ancient Egyptians inherited these amazing mega structures that we can\u2019t even begin to replicate today.

Certain attachments around the encasement would allow either fulcrums or rope attachments to ease movement and allow for tight corner turning with the least amount of men. Once the stone reached the top, the interlocking encasement was disassembled and the stone was leaned over and slid into place.<br>    This technique would have eliminated the need for lifting devices or a massive ramp.<br>    My theory is that most likely it would have been a spherical encasement allowing for tight cornering. This would be the most logical way to transport a large stone using the pyramid itself as the ramp.<br>     So in essence the stones were rolled up the pyramid in a spherical encasement that was removed once the stone reached its destination and leaned and slid into place once atop the pyramid. This process was repeated all the way to the top. <br>     I have not decided yet if the encasements were made of a metal alloy or limestone etc. If bronze was used it would have been melted down for chisel making and as such there would be no evidence of the spherical encasements.<br>    If limestone was used it may have then been discarded and reused for other construction. <br>    In conclusion the only way to deliver a square to the top of a Pyramid is to encase it in a Spherical interlocking encasement.", "comment_date": "2018-08-09T04:32:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HK Normann", "comment_text": "Would have been amazing if they restored some pyramids to their original state", "comment_date": "2018-08-08T17:58:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raj Brar", "comment_text": "They were able to construct these magnificent pyramids but didn&#39;t know about the wheel?

There are five reasons behind this theory. <br>1. Lack of hieroglyphs in the Great Pyramid <br>2.  Copper is too soft to shape granite effectively ( what did they burn to make all this copper? and where are the forges?) <br>3. Does a ruler take all his population( which was very small) and have them haul rocks instead of producing food and trading and protecting the capital?<br>4.

These workers were probably never going to be over 120 pounds, never actually weight trained, and most importantly were IN THEIR TEENS!<br><br>So what can we conclude about this? Well a couple things really. Even with hundreds thousands of people this task is impossible. Not only would all the people have to carry a 1-10 ton brick, but they would have to work the bricks from a far ass distance to do it, then transfer it over to the pyramid only to be lifted up. WHICH IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE! Now no one can tell me with a straight face that 100 people who age about 15 and weigh less than 100 pounds would be able to lift lets say a 5 ton brick. Hell even a thousand cant do it. Reason why? Well 5 tons is 10,000 pounds right? Well if you look at the surface area of said brick, it actually isn&#39;t that large. I would say at max maybe 50 people could even be able to touch it all together with both hands let alone lift it. These guys are gonna be squating maybe 50-100 (MAYBE 100. THAT&#39;S A STRETCH) at max. <br><br>So now, lets say that they flipped said stone. More reasonable, easier to do, makes sense. Well, lets assume this right. They can get 30 people to surround the stone to lift it. At max for flipping it should be half. With that, the weight is significantly less of a burden so it&#39;s overall easier and consumes less workers. The stone however is still 10k pounds and 15 workers can only pick up a total weight of maybe one thousand pounds all together. I&#39;m giving the workers a little extra just to show how difficult this actually is. Well, they would still have to be able to &quot;flip&quot; 5k pounds which again, they won&#39;t even get it off the ground so it&#39;s still impossible. <br><br>So with this evidence alone, it&#39;s impossible to make a pyramid with their technology. Sad but true but I&#39;m enjoying myself so I&#39;ll go on a bit...<br><br>So most theorists say the pyramids were built in 20 years. That means that 400 stones (I gave a little for an even number) would have to be set daily. Well, lets talk about the stone carvers or &quot;hitters&quot; since they hit the stones with rocks. It takes 1 hour to get 5mm down in one single spot. Now i would say that each stone would probably have maybe 2,000 spots? Basing this off of my current desk size and a spot being about 2 by 2 inches. With evening, the stone out completely and saying that each stone required maybe 30mm of work done on each spot, the number comes out quite large. 12,000 hours per brick. That is, and I am not joking about this, a year per stone. 12 hours a day at stone hitting and you get one fully shaped stone in 1 year... MY LORD I DIDN&#39;T EVEN THINK IT WAS GONNA BE THAT BAD!<br><br>Well, unlucky Egyptians. Now of course you can probable have multiple Egyptians working on 1 stone but its still a significant amount of time for something so, simple. And it isn&#39;t even the hard part. So now you know how these things are actually impossible. Even by the 1-2 million people that lived at the time. It&#39;s quite insane when you look back on it and realize that, some people lived and died building the same pyramids never living past the age of 20. Depressing but true...", "comment_date": "2017-07-23T17:58:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P & K -", "comment_text": "The hieroglyphs are symbolic depictions not always literal translations. When they show a tall person and a short person near each other, they are symbolising a tall person in stature and rank, not height (i.e. giants). Likewise, when they depict a man pouring a jug of water on sand, it does not mean that that was literally how it was done. It would have involved thousands of people pouring water. The symbol of one man pouring water just means that water was used by man to, etc, etc. To throw the word Aliens and say that is how it was built is simplistic and too lazy. Ok, if it was intelligent life from outer space, which is possible, then they and the stones and water and sand would still be subject to earth&#39;s gravity. So, pulling, cutting etc, would still need to be used. If you really believe that they would just shine a beam of light through their eyes or from their space craft to build, not just the Great Pyramids but ancient structures all over the world, then you are very nieve and misguided in your thinking. The clues are there in the pyramids, why overlook them. I personally go with the theory that they built from the top down. They used gravity to their advantage. Very difficult, even today, to move over 50 tonnes of stone up, but down is a different story. I struggle with the 20 year build theory, but there was no tv or internet back then, so no distractions for civilization. Moving stone by day and moonlight 24/7 is therefore possible. Remember too, that as you see things today, does not mean it looked like that thousands of years ago. The landscape would have been completely different. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are many mysteries that are just mind scratching. How did they get the measurements, mathematics and alignnents so accurate and cut stone so precise - even today we cannot replicate in many examples of stone found. It sure would have been amazing to have a time lapse camera mounted to see these magnificent structures being built, wouldn&#39;t it? Anyway, thanks for reading.

The Egyptians only mention restorations of the Pyramid and Sfynx, and the techiques you mention are used for the restoration of it. Whoever built the pyramid, had to have known that it was at the exact center of all landmass on earth, this is a fact, which for some reason is never mentioned, look it up. To know the exact geographical center of all landmass on earth requires you to have a detailed map of ALL the continents and ALL coastlines. Think about that. It has huge implications. Or what about the fact that the pyramid rests on a natural aquifer, underground waters that are naturally charged. With absolutely zero hieroglyphs inside the pyramid, as well as the absence of stairs in the pyramid, and the &#39;entrance&#39; initially being sealed with granite (they blasted it open with dynamite) one has to think the pyramid had a practical use, probably multi functional. As for the quarry, rock softening techniques had to have been used, theres no other way to explain the evenly distanced scoop marks in the Aswan quarry. As for the granite, who are you trying to fool here? You claim it was hard and long work pounding granite and show some roughed up work. You could&#39;ve shown the perfectly flat granite surfaces with perfect 90 degree and something 45 degree angles, and explained how hard that would be, to the extent its almost unbelievable. Theres no erasing a mistake in granite. We even find granite Egyptian statues that are perfectly symmetrical. Remember the Greek used bronze or marmer which is much softer!

So if it took two decades to built and the increase in difficulty when getting higher is neglected, then the lower half took 17,5 years and the upper half 2,5 years. If you consider a cone of height h (generalized pyramid) intersected by a plane parallel to the base and measure the distance y from the vertex on top to this plane in order to cut the cone in two half&#39;s of equal volume, you find h/y=\u221b2, i.e. the first half of the volume is in the first 20% of the height and the other half in the last 80%. If you do the same for equal lateral area then h/y=\u221a2, so you find half the lateral area in the first 30% of the height and 70% in the last.

We decided one day on lunch break it would be fun to explore the practical side of how the Egyptian pyramids were built. We used our own project model process, dividing up the research and planning and actually, I think, solved every single problem associated with using the then available technology and materials. some of our engineers really came up with some very simple (surprisingly simple) solution and proved them practical with our pretty advanced engineering software. It was quite fun and I think I am part of the few people who have the whole solution as to &quot;How they did it&quot;. It was not as mysterious and complex as people think. There was obviously no ramp. I was surprised to learn the stones came from a quarry using a technique used to this day- convenient to the way limestone is naturally layered. the stone were not actually &#39;cut&quot; but they were broken out of their layers using simple techniques. This was confirmed by some in-depth existing  geological surveys of the actual Egyptian quarry where the stones came from. I think a few problems such as the shaping of granite by the &quot;dolerite&quot; carving were left unanswered. No one in the firm believed such intricate detailed carving of red granite could have been done using that technique considering the time and manpower available to the project.

The time involved in that kind of a technique would absolutely preclude that possibility, as they would have required a gigantic army of people (far too many to fit in all the quarries in Aswan) to produce blocks fast enough to have built the pyramids in 20 years time.<br><br>I know it <i>seems</i> like a conspiracy theory to believe that they had technology more advanced than rocks and copper chisels, but the evidence seems quite clear. The Ancient Egyptians were <i>way</i> more advanced than we give them credit for. Consider how much weight these people placed on geometry, precision, craftsmanship. Their language is a lot more advanced than any other language at the time which we know of, and that hints at a <i>vastly</i> greater intelligence than we give them credit for.<br><br>The harsh conditions would also have destroyed most &quot;soft&quot; technology, like papyrus records or even string. There is a lot of advanced mathematics that one can do with nothing more than a straight edge and a string, actually, and their later obsession with measuring and dividing up lands into sections is well documented, and used no more advanced materials than chains and poles. They may have even had other &quot;soft&quot; technologies like this. Anything from glass blowing and electroplating of metals, to iron tools or  basic wooden furniture, would <i>not</i> have survived to even the Middle Kingdom period unless it was hidden in a Tomb. We forget, the Ancient Egyptians were as distant from the Middle Kingdom as those people were to the Late Kingdom, who were just as ancient to the Ancient Greeks, who were again as ancient to the Ancient Romans, who in turn just as ancient to the Medieval period, who are just as distant in time from us.

In my opinion, this is a much more logical and practical way to build a pyramid.

The first two definitely were not (the step and bent). The red pyramid possibly was, but I would guess this was a new technique for the great pyramid. Maybe it was discontinued after that, idk. I&#39;ve not seen any evidence that other pyramids were built in this manner. Not to say it doesn&#39;t exist, I just haven&#39;t looked. The great pyramid though, it was almost certainly built this way.<br><br>Also my theory about the slaves. I do believe slaves were involved in the construction. However, they were probably used only for the most basic labor. Labor such as pulling the stones, cutting the rough stones from the quarry, etc. Any kind of job requiring at least a minimal level of skill was probably done by Egyptian citizens. You have to remember the time in which the pyramids were built. Upper and lower Egypt were literally just united into one kingdom.

This would be a talk of a theorist whose only idea of building comes from observing modern building sites and the use of cranes there. Nothing bad in observing and drawing conclusions, but cranes are not the only way to build.<br><br>Depending on the surface, you only need a regular tractor and a proper sledge or wheeled cart to move big blocks of stone. Add slope to that surface and you could move the said blocks higher, thus being able to stack the blocks on top of each other. Add an exit ramp for the tractor and you could have a train of tractors mounting blocks on a pyramid. And so, with modern tools and enough financing you could quite easily build plenty of pyramids. Replace tractors with manpower, line the sledge skids with copper and you have roughly what they had in ancient times.<br> <br>I also find it very curious to see skeptics say &quot;the pyramids are built too precisely, humans could not do that with hand tools&quot;. It is as if the builders had to imagine the measurements and cut blindly, hoping the pieces fit. That is such a backwards thought that it boggles my mind. Anyone with any experience in construction knows that you do not measure every piece with a ruler, but you use templates for repeated processes.<br> <br>It may be strange technology to some people today, but I am fairly certain that the Egyptians used simple wooden frames to help cut blocks to proper size. You can build a template from four wooden boards in minutes and when cutting a block, make measurements with it so the template fits vertically just through the block. With seven more boards you can make a horizontal arc-like template to measure and fit the height of the block. With these two simple templates you could produce any amount of practically identical blocks. You do not even necessarily need nails to make the templates, just a piece of rope for measuring and a saw to notch the boards, so they fit nicely and firmly.<br> <br>And how do you make sure the blocks are aligned the right way on-site? You use... <b>dramatic music</b>... more wooden templates (with some rope)! You simply build templates that are aligned by the corners and sides of the floor below, so each new layer is angled and fit perfectly. This means that once you have the lowest floor well-measured, you can just keep on building on top of that with floor-templates. I would imagine they took control measurements while at it, since you do want to make sure the templates produce what you want.<br><br>Oh, about the rock: even some alien-theorists admit that limestone can be quarried with copper tools, so there is not much argument about the base material. But what about the granite then? Surely it was cut and delivered by aliens! Well, no. Just because the skeptics think that cutting rock with another rock is impossibly tedious and they could never imagine themselves capable of cutting a nice smooth surface with just a rock, it does not make it impossible for a talented craftsman to do it. The ancient Egyptians apparently also used blunt copper saws and sand to cut granite, which makes perfect sense considering their environment. Again, just because a skeptic himself can not imagine the setup of a cutting team with sawyers, sand-inserters, dust-removers, blade-fitters, repairmen, measurers and a host of other tasks involved, it would still make sense that the men back then came up with ways to make the process efficient.<br><br>And no, I have never built a pyramid but I have built other structures with basic tools. It is not hard to imagine that the Egyptians just scaled simple methods and produced something as awesome as the pyramids, if you let go of the perilous thought that just because you can not imagine how it happened, it could not have happened.", "comment_date": "2016-05-03T15:11:06Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Abdallah Hamed", "comment_text": "i think that the ancient egyptians had been reached to sciences we didn&#39;t reach to it yet", "comment_date": "2016-05-01T00:19:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hamdy Mahgoub", "comment_text": "I&#39;m Egyptian, Yay!", "comment_date": "2016-04-28T16:55:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nealbot Debot", "comment_text": "Thanks dude", "comment_date": "2016-04-28T07:16:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bobsicle", "comment_text": "lol ma house", "comment_date": "2016-04-27T21:37:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrMaddy24", "comment_text": "I made the damn piramids, i no da secret", "comment_date": "2016-04-27T19:45:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Boshra", "comment_text": "Proud to be Egyptian ;)", "comment_date": "2016-04-27T15:18:24Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "Ionlymadethistoleavecoments", "comment_text": "Why can you climb the pyramid?

Ancient Egyptians understood the power of water and I&#39;m certain they used it somehow in the construction of the pyramid. Our society thinks in a completely different way than the Ancient Egyptians so it&#39;s very difficult to imagine their methods. Clearly they found a way to shape and move these stones with ease. Their engineering and math must have been far more precise and clever than ours is. It&#39;s very plausible that they were far more intelligent than we are, and that the extremely inteligent were essentially out bred by those of lower intelligence, the common man.

If work was done on it 7 days a week 10 hours a day 365 days a year a stone had to be laid every 2 minutes. But the vast majority of the workers were farmers that could only work during the flooding of the nile, 3 months out of the year. Accounting for that, a stone had to be laid every few seconds, with an accuracy unparalleled in the modern world.- The great pyramid has a 13 acre base, using sattelite measures it was determined that the top of the pyramid is a quarter of an inch off the center of the base.<br>- Some stones weigh more than 40 tons, up to 135 feet high in the pyramid, placed with micron accuracy.- Copper doesn&#39;t cut granite, it is exactly like trying to cut aluminium with a lead saw (in fact worse than that). Sand is mostly quartz, so it could cut granite <b>in theory</b>, but the idea that you could cut 40 ton blocks like that and have them straignt with less than a milimiter deviation is just outrageous. Its as impossible as ingraving a microprocessor with a hammer and chisel made of cheese.- Where did all the wood needed come from ? According to the theory, it was imported from Europe (no straight face was attempted while typing that). There isn&#39;t a single piece of evidence for it.- Over a million hyeroglyph walls in Egypt telling us about every aspect of the lifes of those who supposedly built the pyramids: how they made love, how they went to the toilet, what they ate, everything. Not one of those walls describe or talk about or even simply says &quot;we built the pyramids&quot;. Not a single hyeroglyph inside or on the pyramids either. Not even the name of the guy its supposed to burry.- Not a single mummy was found in the pyramids. Interesting fact since archeologists had to dynamite their way into the pyramid. Still, the official explanation for this is essentially ghost grave robbers.- When the ramses museum was built, they wanted to include the nearby granite statue, so they asked for it to be moved inside the building. The engeneers came back and said it had to be cut in 20 pieces to be moved, because it weighed in excess of 1000 tons. The largest landcrane on earth can lift 200 tons barely, from a boat to a dock. Thousands of years ago the egyptians were carrying 1000 ton solid pink granite objects hundreds of miles with ease. That&#39;s completely unexplainable without the use of advanced technology, we aren&#39;t even close to being able to do what they did. Instead the museum was built around it.<br>We don&#39;t have a clue how the pyramids were built, but the theory you are presenting is laughable, especially since like I did you had a chance to see it for yourself, sadly you didn&#39;t see that the ideas you accepted for how what you saw was built had absolutely no bearing in reality, theory and especially practice.

We&#39;re talking of engineering and architecture only modern machinery has been able to imitate. <br><br>***The cornerstone foundations of the pyramid have ball and socket construction capable of dealing with heat expansion and earthquakes.<br><br>***The mortar used is of an unknown origin (Yes, no explanation given). It has been analyzed and its chemical composition is known but it can\u2019t be reproduced. It is stronger than the stone and still holding up today.<br><br>***It was originally covered with casing stones (made of highly polished limestone). These casing stones reflected the sun\u2019s light and made the pyramid shine like a jewel. They are no longer present being used by Arabs to build mosques after an earthquake in the 14th century loosened many of them. It has been calculated that the original pyramid with its casing stones would act like gigantic mirrors and reflect light so powerful that it would be visible from the moon as a shining star on earth. Appropriately, the ancient Egyptians called the Great Pyramid \u201cIkhet\u201d, meaning the \u201cGlorious Light\u201d.  <br><br>***Aligned True North: The Great Pyramid is the most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error. The position of the North Pole moves over time and the pyramid was exactly aligned at one time.<br><br>***Center of Land Mass: The Great Pyramid is located at the center of the land mass of the earth. The east/west parallel that crosses the most land and the north/south meridian that crosses the most land intersect in two places on the earth, one in the ocean and the other at the Great Pyramid.<br><br>***The granite coffer in the \u201cKing\u2019s Chamber\u201d is too big to fit through the passages and so it must have been put in place during construction.<br><br>***The coffer was made out of a block of solid granite. This would have required bronze saws 8-9 ft. long set with teeth of sapphires. Hollowing out of the interior would require tubular drills of the same material applied with a tremendous vertical force.<br><br>***Microscopic analysis of the coffer reveals that it was made with a fixed point drill that used hard jewel bits and a drilling force of 2 tons.<br><br>***The Great Pyramid had a swivel door entrance at one time. Swivel doors were found in only two other pyramids: Khufu\u2019s father and grandfather, Sneferu and Huni, respectively.<br><br><b>*</b> It is reported that when the pyramid was first broken into that the swivel door, weighing some 20 tons, was so well balanced that it could be opened by pushing out from the inside with only minimal force, but when closed, was so perfect a fit that it could scarcely be detected and there was not enough crack or crevice around the edges to gain a grasp from the outside.<br><br>***With the mantle in place, the Great Pyramid could be seen from the mountains in Israel and probably the moon as well.<br><br>***The weight of the pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons. Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of the earth\u2019s mass.<br><br><b>**Sun\u2019s Radius: Twice the perimeter of the bottom of the granite coffer times 10^8 is the sun\u2019s mean radius.

They even found hairs inside block material because in the process of making those blocks and shapes some kind of fabric was used . They compared real granite and pyramid block granite material density through microscope -the difference was clear that this is a mix of many materials in those blocks ,even the outside of blocks were easily breakable with a simple finger nail just scratching the surface -try to scratch real granite or stone and make it break  .

The idea is like moving a refrigerator back tipping it and putting the weight on a side or corner and turning it to move it in place. As for the lifting location on the pyramid, you leave a stone protruding from the face to provide a flat surface to lift the stone to the work layer. If you stair step the protruding stone from each layer then you can continue to lift the stones up the full height of the pyramid, layer by layer. After the rough pyramid is built with the big stones then the\u00a0finish stones are placed then the\u00a0flat face is chiseled from the top down giving the flat finished surface.

The Great Pyramid (known as that of Khufu/Cheops) contains no Pharaoh\u2019s body, no treasure chamber, and no treasures. There is no indication that it ever has contained these things. The popular myth of the Pyramids being royal tombs is clearly nonsense. The tombs archaeology has accepted \u2013 those in the Valleys of the Kings and Queens \u2013are obviously tombs, storehouses of the Pharaoh\u2019s earthly riches, intricately prepared to ensure his survival in the next world. The Great Pyramid contains none of the obvious trappings of a tomb.<br><br>2. The only reason it is known as the Khufu/Cheops Pyramid at all is due to some Victorian graffiti! When Colonel Howard Vyse blasted his way into the Great Pyramid he was determined to make his name as an Egyptologist. He longed for nothing more than to make some monumental discovery which would make him famous. His disappointment at finding the Pyramid empty was too much for him to bear \u2013 it was his last season in Egypt \u2013 and in the dead of night it is said that he crept up into the \u2018air shafts\u2019 (known as \u2018spirit stones\u2019 to the Egyptians) above the King\u2019s Chamber and daubed some hieroglyphs in red paint. The following morning he made his \u2018discovery\u2019 and subsequently earned his place in the history books as being the man who discovered the identity of the owner of the Great Pyramid!<br><br>It is worth mentioning in addition that the symbols he painted were not even accurate ones for the period in which the Pyramid was then believed to have been built. The symbol for \u2018Ra\u2019 \u2013 chief amongst the Egyptian gods at that time \u2013 was depicted wrongly. Now surely if an Egyptian had painted that symbol he would have got it right! Not to do so would have been a grave insult to the most highly respected and feared of the Egyptian pantheon.<br><br>3. The stone sarcophagus which is contained within the Great Pyramid is too large to have been brought into the chamber in which it stands. Many books on the subject of this particular anomaly either point blank ignore the question or state rather bizarrely that the sarcophagus must have been installed during the building process. Now, surely, to a civilisation as advanced as that of the Ancient Egyptians, this solution would have made no sense whatsoever. If the reason for making the sarcophagus \u2013 which incidentally shows no indication of ever having been occupied \u2013 larger than the doorway was to put off thieves, surely the subsequent sealing of the chamber with huge stone portcullis blocks, and the thorough blocking off of the Ascending Corridor which leads to the King\u2019s Chamber by three enormous granite plugs, would have been sufficient. It is highly unlikely that the opportunistic thieves of Ancient Egypt would have taken the time to plough through that much solid rock just to get into a chamber which they must have known was empty of all riches. And if the chamber was completely barren and empty, why go to such great lengths to ensure that it wasn\u2019t opened up ever again? What secrets does the so-called King\u2019s Chamber hold?<br><br>4. Some visitors, including the great and fearless Emperor Napoleon himself, have experienced strange visions and environmental distortions whilst inside the Great Pyramid, particularly the King\u2019s Chamber. In the 1930s, author Paul Brunton spent a night there and was assailed by visions of \u201ca circle of hostile creatures\u201d which he likened to \u201celemental creations, grotesque shapes, madmen, hulking and devilish apparitions\u201d. Was this mere hallucination? In more recent times such ideas have been put down to the background radiation given off by the black granite of the chamber, but surely if it was that simple then everyone who visited the chamber would experience a similar thing, wouldn\u2019t they?<br><br>Early experiments indicated that the King\u2019s Chamber \u2018spirit stones\u2019 did seem to generate an electrical field which caused minor shock to at least one poor visitor drinking from a metal hip flask! It has been suggested that the Pyramid, because of its granite blocks, could transmit and receive radio and even microwave signals very well, and some believe that it gives off energy in an \u2018emanating apex\u2019 \u2013 this means that energy spirals off the top of the structure in a circle which widens as it permeates the atmosphere. Whilst some have seen this as mere New Age hokum, others have said this confirms their suspicions that the Pyramid is some kind of beacon intended for use from space.<br><br>More recently, ex-NASA consultant Richard Hoagland has stated that radioactive sand was found in a chamber behind the Queen\u2019s Chamber, which might explain both the weird experiences of Napoleon et al, and the anomalous radioactive date readings given by the Pyramid -in which it appears that the top of the structure is 1000 years older than the bottom! This has led some people to speculate that the Pyramid was constructed upside down in mid air by alien technology and then swung over into place on the Giza Plateau. I could not possibly comment.<br><br>5. A road eight feet wide and four inches thick could be built from San Francisco to New York and put inside the Great Pyramid. It has also been speculated that a wall three feet high and one foot thick could be built all the way around France with the amount of stone it took to build the Great Pyramid. Its perimeter is almost 1 kilometre, and the inside area \u2013 a massive 53,000 square metres \u2013 would be able to incorporate the cathedrals of Florence, Milan and St Peter\u2019s (The Vatican), as well as Westminster Abbey and St Paul\u2019s. And this was accomplished by people of the Stone Age, yes?<br><br>6. They are the sole remnant of the Seven Wonders of the World. The Pyramids are also, apart from the Great Wall of China, the oldest surviving artificial structures on Earth.<br><br>7. There are no true hieroglyphic markings inside the Pyramids \u2013 remarkable for a nation which carved them into just about every available surface they had. Nor are there any real clues from hieroglyphs elsewhere as to how the Pyramids were built. The only hieroglyphs inside the Great Pyramid are the red paint daubings of Howard Vyse and are not genuine Ancient Egyptian carvings. Although Pyramids elsewhere in Egypt, most notably those of a much later date than the Pyramids at Giza, do contain hieroglyphs \u2013 the derivation of the so-called \u2018Pyramid Texts\u2019 \u2013 the Great Pyramid and its two companions of the Giza Plateau are untouched by the scribe\u2019s knife.<br><br>8. As Giza Pyramid investigator August Tornquist states: \u201cThe Great Pyramid was the greatest single undertaking in the whole history of mankind. And yet there is not one picture or drawing, not one artefact, not one inventory or tally sheet to tell of its construction. The Egyptians left us some 3000 years of written and pictorial history covering virtually everything that happened in their culture. From babies being born, to ploughing and harvesting, building, weaving, sacrificing, praying, embalming\u2026 but nothing about the Pyramids of Giza. Why?\u201d<br><br>For a nation that loved to boast, they seem strangely reticent to tell us anything about the Pyramids at Giza. Perhaps the reason was simply because they were as much a mystery to the Ancient Egyptians as they are to us.<br>There is in fact documentary evidence \u2013 from Sumerian clay tablets unearthed in the great historical library of Nineveh \u2013 that the Great Pyramid was known to the Sumerians of 10,000 years ago, 6000 years before the first Pharaoh of Egypt was even born!<br><br>9. It is built to face true North, supposedly at a time when such computations could not have been possible. Are we to believe that the Ancient Egyptians \u2013 on top of all their other wonders \u2013 were also the first civilisation to possess knowledge of mathematics so precise that they could determine true North from magnetic North? Come to that, are we to believe that they could even find magnetic North, or know what its significance was? Tied in with this idea of being able to locate true North is the notion that the Earth is round, a fact not generally accepted until the last few centuries. Some still dispute it even today!<br><br>10. The Great Pyramid is located at the exact centre of the Earth\u2019s land mass. That is, its East-West axis corresponds to the longest land parallel across the Earth, passing through Africa, Asia, and America. Similarly, the longest land meridian on Earth, through Asia, Africa, Europe, and Antarctica, also passes right through the Pyramid. Since the Earth has enough land area to provide 3 billion possible building sites for the Pyramid, the odds of it having been built where it is are 1:3 billion. As previously discussed in my article on Anomalous Maps, the ability to compute longitude was not supposedly available to cartographers or anybody else until the 18th century. Without an understanding of longitude it would be exceptionally difficult to be able to pinpoint the size, shape, and relative mappings of the Earth\u2019s land masses and seas. Without longitude it would have been near impossible to undertake major sea journeys, and yet if the evidence (such as Egyptian mummies containing cocaine traces) is reliable, the Egyptians did actually undertake such exploratory missions, even as far as South America (the only place the cocaine could have come from). (All this despite their apparent hatred of sailing on the open seas!) And even if we accept that the Egyptians of thousands of years ago were competent navigators, how could they have known about the exact interrelation of the rest of the Earth\u2019s land mass? And then there are the statistics\u2026<br><br>11. Like 20th century bridge designs, the Great Pyramid\u2019s cornerstones have balls and sockets built into them. Several football fields long, the Pyramid is subject to movements of expansion and contraction from heat and cold, as well as earthquakes, settling, and other such phenomena. After 4,600 years its structure would have been significantly damaged without such construction. Recent construction experts called in to offer suggestions as to how the Pyramid could have been built make reference to the \u2018settle factor\u2019 of any large building. They have publicly stated that while the acceptable settle factor of a modern skyscraper is 6\u2033 per hundred years, the simple fact is that the Pyramid \u2013 using more construction material than 35 Empire State Buildings \u2013 has settled less than 1/2\u2033 in 5000 years! Modern construction has also averred that although for a large modern tower block the acceptable variance from complete alignment of all four sides is 6\u2033, the four sides of the Pyramid are out of perfect alignment by less than 1/4\u2033!<br><br>The casing stones, 144,000 in all, were so brilliant that they could literally be seen from the mountains of Israel hundreds of miles away. For those interested in possible symbolic significance, in Bible prophecy 144,000 is the number of people \u2013 12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel \u2013 who are supposed to evangelise the world in the days before the Apocalypse. The outside surface stones are cut within 0.01\u2033 of perfectly straight and at nearly perfect right angles for all six sides. And they were placed together with a gap between them of only 0.02\u2033. Modern technology cannot place such 20-ton stones with greater accuracy than those in the Pyramid. As already noted above, the variance from perfect alignment seen in the Pyramid is still something which is unattainable today.<br><br>What can we deduce from these facts? That whoever built the Pyramids used a technology that we still do not possess today to cut, move, and cement stones. Whoever built it also had some considerable knowledge of the Earth, because they were built in one of the few locations with a strong enough bedrock to support the great weight. The builders also knew where the greatest land mass of the Earth was in both the North-South and East-West directions. After studying the detailed measurements made by the investigators before him, Sir Isaac Newton (who was fascinated by the Pyramids) recognised that many key measurements would be in round numbers if the standard unit of measure was just 0.001\u2033 (1/1,000) larger than the British inch \u2013 which just happens to be the Sacred Jewish Inch. (The Sacred Jewish Inch, 1/25 of a cubit, equals 1.00106 British inches.) This discovery allowed the secrets of the Pyramid to be unlocked and revealed unmistakable and mathematical relationships.<br><br>For instance: A \u2013 We know from geometry that there is a universal relationship between the diameter of a circle and its circumference. Consider this: The height of the Pyramid\u2019s apex is 5,812.98\u2033, and each side is 9,131\u2033 from corner to corner (in a straight line). If the circumference of the Pyramid is divided by twice its height (the diameter of a circle is twice the radius), the result is 3.14159, which just happens to be pi. Incredibly, this calculation is accurate to six digits. So the Pyramid is a square circle, and thus pi was designed into it 4,600 years ago. Pi is demonstrated many times throughout the Pyramid.<br><br>B \u2013 Other numbers are also repeated throughout. Each of the Great Pyramid\u2019s four walls, when measured as a straight line, are 9,131\u2033, for a total of 36,524\u2033. At first glance, this number may not seem significant, but move the decimal point over and you get 365.24. Modern science has shown us that the exact length of the solar year is 365.24 days.<br><br>C \u2013 The average height of land above sea level (Miami being low and the Himalayas being high), as can be measured only by modern-day satellites and computers, happens to be 5,449\u2033. That is the exact height of the Pyramid.<br><br>D \u2013 All four sides of the Pyramid are very slightly and evenly bowed in, or concave. This effect, which cannot be detected by looking at the Pyramid from the ground, was discovered around 1940 by a pilot taking aerial photos to check certain measurements. As measured by today\u2019s laser instruments, all of these perfectly cut and intentionally bowed stone blocks duplicate exactly the curvature of the earth. The radius of this bow is equal to the radius of the Earth. This radius of curvature is what Newton had long been seeking.<br><br>All this has led many to see the Pyramids (particularly the Great Pyramid) as being built by visitors from another planet, since the technology was obviously not such as would have been available to Stone Age Man. The theorists speculate that the Pyramid is a message, a symbol of knowledge which we as early humans learnt to decipher, and hence built our own versions of the Pyramid, examples of which litter the Egyptian desert plateau in crumbling ruins. This message indicates that whoever built the Pyramid knew the Earth well: the length of the year, the radius of curvature, the standard measurement techniques, the average height of the continents, and the centre of the land mass. They were able to construct something that we still cannot construct today, and they were able to tie all these things together in this single structure. Were they extraterrestrial, or perhaps even supernatural? Some people think so.

Scientist Davidovits affirms that the stones which were used to build the pyramids were mainly from limestone, clay and water. The tests made by using Nanotechnology (the branch of engineering that deals with things smaller than 100 nanometers) proved the existence of large quantities of water in these rocks; such quantities do not exist in natural stones.<br><br>Furthermore,there is also consistency in the internal structure of stones which confirms that it is unreasonable \u00a0that these stones were brought, then \u00a0were carved in this way. The most realistic possibility is that they poured the clay in molds to make identical stones just as today as we pour plastic tools in templates so all the pieces are quite equal and similar.<br><br>Electronic microscope was used to analyze samples of the pyramids stones. The result was closer to the opinion of Prof. Davidovits and the quartz crystals appeared clearly as a result of heating the mud. He stated that we don`t have in the nature like these stones which his confirms they were made by the Pharaohs. The analysis by Mini E scale indicated the presence of silicon dioxide too. This is another proof that the stones are not natural. Scientific fact corresponds with the Quran<br><br>After all these facts, we can reach to this result, which is: the technique used in the Age of the Pharaohs to build massive buildings such as pyramids, was mainly using the normal mud available near the River Nile. Then mixing it with water, placing it in templates and finally lighting the fire until it solidifies and stones are shaped the way we see today.<br><br>This technique remained hidden as a secret until 1981, when that scientist put his theory. Then in 2006, other scientists proved the validity of the theory, beyond any doubt, by laboratory analysis, this technique was entirely unknown at the time of Quran. But what does the Quran say? Let`s my brothers and sisters consider and praise Allah, Almighty.<br>In\u00a0the Quran The pharaoh asked Haman, his deputy and partner, to build a huge monument to prove to the people that God does not exist.

It did not take us very long to figure out that the easiest way to move them was by trying to flip them over from side to side. Of course we also realized that stones that were squares were harder to move than stones with rounded corners. I mean, once you realize that rolling an object is an easier way to move a heavy object than dragging it across the floor and that the rounder the object is the easier it is to roll it... then you have pretty much discovered the wheel. I mean, there must have been some religious or ideological reasons that prevented these cultures from using wheels just as a consequence of normal human intuition.

For one thing, there is a problem with the idea of external scaffolding, or dragging blocks up the side of the pyramid besides there being no evidence of that physical, textual, ectetera. They wouldn&#39;t have the ability to secure these ramps to the side of the pyramid, and if they could, they would risk deforming the shape both because of the difficulty in surveying the progress and the forces exerted by the blocks and teams on the ramps.<br><br>However new evidence has been gathered to help with this. A team of researchers were permitted by the Egyptian government to take ground penetrating radar equipment into the Great Pyramid to search for additional passages. They managed to discover several internal passages that had been blocked off, and made to look like regular walls, that together formed a spiral ramp from the base of the pyramid to the top of the grand staircase.<br><br>The grand staircase has also been noted by several other expeditions to have bizarre properties. For one thing, it is a disproportionately tall chamber compared to all the others. The top stair is extremely eroded, far more than the other stairs in the chamber. There are regular bore holes drilled into the surface of the staircase suggesting that there was some structure fixed into the chamber that was later removed. The floor of the chamber is infused with some kind of grease.<br><br>The working idea so far is that the grand staircase was used as a rudimentary elevator, and these blocked off passages were used to drag up the blocks without compromising the shape of the outside of the pyramid. This allowed the pyramid to stay structurally defined from start to finish, making it very for surveyors to monitor progress and make intelligent corrections. It also explains how they were able to build 80% of the pyramid.", "comment_date": "2014-11-05T19:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "supertigik", "comment_text": "ILLUMINATI", "comment_date": "2014-11-05T19:26:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AVoidDances", "comment_text": "Pyramids were built with great accuracy because they ARE machines built to withstand vibrations just like modern machines.
