It had controlled &quot;ALL THERE&quot; via GRAVITISM.<br>        Over the last decades there have been remarkable developments in thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. Yet many of the basic problems have remained largely unsolved. In the spectrum of opinions expressed by authors who have attempted to solve these problems, one can roughly distinguish three main schools of thought:<br><br>1) Traditional\u00a0axiomatic\u00a0thermodynamics, which cannot explain the origin of irreversibility and time asymmetries.<br><br>2) The statistical school, which generates\u00a0\u201cman-made irreversibility\u2019\u2019\u00a0by imposing asymmetric conditions on symmetric ones in order to describe reality.<br><br>3)\u00a0The new gravitational school, which\u00a0deduces\u00a0the origin of evolution, irreversibility, electromagnetic and thermodynamics from Einsteinian gravitation and the verified expansion of the universe.<br>This school includes some new modifications to physics, as part of GRAVITISM.<br><br>My object is to obtain a consistent mathematical formulation of irreversibility in probabilistic theories. So far physicists have done this by means of (a priori) imposing on symmetric equations an (often hidden postulate of) asymmetry (which,\u00a0in itself, is equivalent to the very results that the mathematical analysis is aimed \u201cto prove\u201d).\u00a0In other words, the (asymmetric) \u201cresults\u201d (of classical and quantum-statistical physics) are not really results for they are deliberately enforced on, not deduced from symmetric formalism.<br><br>Such tactics are unacceptable, They lead to misleading philosophy of science, which, in turn, has generated a ludicrously incongruous mode of thinking in education and philosophy E.g. when, in 1915, Einstein discovered pre-existing Mercury mathematics-physics, it was not man-made, it was &quot;there&quot; at least since &quot;genesis&quot;.<br><br>Advocates of man-made irreversibility fall into the trap of assuming that which they set out to prove, and it was already &quot;There&quot;. Imposed, man-made mathematics, to fit extant reality, cannot get uncertainty for certainty, nor indeterminism from determinism\u00a0(see below).* These conclusions lead to somewhat surprising results, which, in turn, are related to the very core of our physical theories and to the role of time, causality, and determinism in philosophy.", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T09:12:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason C.", "comment_text": "So everything is light? \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2022-05-31T03:28:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dhiresh Yadav", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not that the empty space that gives us most of our mass.

Does a photon transfer spatial curvature from one location to another? Wrap a piece of wire around a pencil and it can produce a 3D coil of wire, much like a spring. When viewed from the side it can look like a two-dimensional sine wave. You could coil the wire with either a right-hand twist, or with a left-hand twist. Could Planck&#39;s Constant be proportional to the twist cycles. A photon with a higher frequency has more energy. (More spatial curvature). What if gluons are actually made up of these twisted tubes which become entangled with other tubes to produce quarks. (In the same way twisted electrical extension cords can become entangled.) Therefore, the gluons are actually a part of the quarks. Mesons are made up of two entangled tubes (Quarks/Gluons), while protons and neutrons would be made up of three entangled tubes. (Quarks/Gluons) The &quot;Color Force&quot; would be related to the XYZ coordinates (orientation) of entanglement. &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot;, and &quot;flux tubes&quot; make sense based on this concept. Neutrinos would be made up of a twisted torus (like a twisted donut) within this model. Gravity is a result of a very small curvature imbalance within atoms. (This is why the force of gravity is so small.) Instead of attempting to explain matter as &quot;particles&quot;, this concept attempts to explain matter more in the manner of our current understanding of the space-time curvature of gravity. If an electron has qualities of both a particle and a wave, it cannot be either one. It must be something else. Therefore, a &quot;particle&quot; is actually a structure which stores spatial curvature. Can an electron-positron pair (which are made up of opposite directions of twist) annihilate each other by unwinding into each other producing Gamma Ray photons.\r<br>\r<br>Does an electron travel through space like a threaded nut traveling down a threaded rod, with each twist cycle proportional to Planck\u2019s Constant?  Does it wind up on one end, while unwinding on the other end?   Is this related to the Higgs field?  Does this help explain the strange \u00bd spin of many subatomic particles?  Does the 720 degree rotation of a 1/2 spin particle require at least one extra dimension?\r<br>\r<br> Alpha decay occurs when the two protons and two neutrons (which are bound together by entangled tubes), become un-entangled from the rest of the nucleons\r<br>\r<br>. Beta decay occurs when the tube of a down quark/gluon in a neutron becomes overtwisted and breaks producing a twisted torus (neutrino) and an up quark, and the ejected electron. The phenomenon of Supercoiling involving twist and writhe cycles may reveal how overtwisted quarks can produce these new particles. The conversion of twists into writhes, and vice-versa, is an interesting process.\r<br>\r<br> Gamma photons are produced when a tube unwinds producing electromagnetic waves.", "comment_date": "2022-01-23T20:50:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Real", "comment_text": "So I\u2019m theory pulling quarts apart kind of counts as turning energy into matter right?", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T07:08:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kay Sherrif", "comment_text": "im only getting hot tea now, better value for money", "comment_date": "2022-01-17T16:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03a4\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1", "comment_text": "The corect word for colour in Greek is  chroma (\u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1).", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T18:26:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kulji Singh", "comment_text": "How is this video 8 years old????", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T17:35:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Param Pampam", "comment_text": "yo mate, but there is no particle called &quot;energy&quot;.

Space is a dense field of extremely pressurized electron neutrinos. This creates quark plasma and is what black holes are made of. Black holes begin their conservation of energy and mass by creating neutrons on their surface by combining quarks and electron neutrinos. This lets the black hole emit its first light. The neutrons break down into the first hydrogen atoms. As the surface is now a mixture of hydrogen and neutrons, the beta minus decay reaction takes the two and form the first helium atoms. This process continues creating heavier elements over time making the quark plasma filter the gamma rays the black hole once emitted exclusively. Quark plasma supplies the energy needed to carry out these reactions because it is the most efficient reaction in the universe. The reaction continues unimpeded because the electron neutrinos of space flow through normal matter. The conservation of energy ends up turning the once minimum entropy matter into maximum entropy matter like our Moon. Jupiter is the only planet in our solar system that has not completed its crust. That is why the atmosphere at the equator moves so fast. All this energy was given to everything in our observable universe because the big bang was merely our universe turning itself into a gargantuan particle collider with the galaxies being quark plasma shrapnel. Even our moon was an initial mass of quark plasma when it was born. All black holes are made of are quarks and the endless catalyst of the electron neutrinos of space.", "comment_date": "2021-10-05T00:50:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pepco Rampouch", "comment_text": "Slow down, breaaathe dude. :-D", "comment_date": "2021-10-02T22:08:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rohan Jagdale", "comment_text": "Big fan of Derek", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T02:07:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fadadapple", "comment_text": "Quarks also get their mass from Higgs", "comment_date": "2021-09-28T22:07:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hart Unstart", "comment_text": "Just find out how to rip the energy off the quarks.

The Higgs field does not slow anything down, it is NOT like molasses.  If it were true that Higgs slowed particles down then all particles that interact with Higgs would very quickly come to a complete stop.  Second, the Higgs field IS what grants the mass to, in your example, an electron.  It is not energy bound in the subatomic particles.  What are you talking about?  The Higgs field allows atomic entities like the electron to borrow and give back energy which is used to flip its spin.  The borrowing and giving of energy does not in any way affect the actual Higgs field, this is its unique property.  The back and forth flipping of the electron as it propagates through space time is the property that we call mass by definition.", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T13:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde1\ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde1", "comment_text": "Can someone explain to me clearly what mass is", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T11:53:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colby Notes", "comment_text": "This is how physics works at the Strickland House.<br>Technically speaking, the view from your house may be different.<br><br>Which is what makes it really interesting.<br><br>Filmed at: Milk Beach, Hermitage Foreshore Walk, Vaucluse NSW 2030, Australia", "comment_date": "2021-02-15T09:47:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2", "comment_text": "Then how neutrinos takes their mass?

Probable you will say that they exist, but they don&#39;t interact, or they interact poorly. Correct because if they were able to interact everywhere except of the laboratory spot of the nature, immediately they will destroy everything they have created. So the question is where could be the nature&#39;s laboratory, with such most of the energy which will make them to interact? Well, I see only one spot with these criteria in the galactic web where the gravity interaction between galaxies, probable are the strongest energy spots of the Universe because the all mass of all galaxies in a galactic cluster is been involved.

The experiment consisted of weighing a person&#39;s weight once the person was proclaimed dead. Mcdougall&#39;s research concluded that in the precise moment of death, the patient lost about three-quarters of an ounce or about 21g of mass. Mcdougall took this as an indication that humans have souls and that the estimated weight of these souls was 21g. Many people have taken this as an indication that humans, in-fact have souls. However, today I stumbled across another video published by, Verytasium In which he states that &quot;21G that is the mass of all the electrons in your body.&quot; He states that this is due to your electrons traveling through space-time and interact with the Higgs field and is the Higgs Field that gives them their mass, slows them down, and stops them from flying out at the speed of light. Then he moves on to a different subject that is unrelated to this. However, the moment I had hers this my brain clicked in a way that made me realize that I&#39;ve heard that calculation of mass somewhere else. that&#39;s when I stumbled across the, studied done by Mcdougall, which in the past I&#39;ve heard about his experiments but I never really knew who he was. The moment I realize these two things were related, the mass you lose when you die and the number of electrons in your body. My Hypothesis is that once you die the electrons inside your body stops interacting with the Higgs field there for are now free to leave the body therefore explaining the loss of weight at the moment of death. I believe this is what Mcdougall had confused for the human soul, but in reality, it could just be the electrons in our body leaving.", "comment_date": "2021-01-16T19:58:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Agiovlasitis", "comment_text": "Who ever named quarks, is to date the best troll that&#39;s ever existed.", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T23:44:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rijnswaand", "comment_text": "I always wondered how plumbusses were made", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T22:33:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Damiano", "comment_text": "Cop: how much did you have??<br>Random person: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc6QPNUqls&amp;t=0m01s\">0:01</a>", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T16:21:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrey Stavitskiy", "comment_text": "Are you basically saying that a moving particle is more affected by gravity than a still one?

Also the smaller the scale the more efficient the step. And the more efficient the step. the greater the motion. And the greater the motion. The greater the mass. And the greater the mass the greater the time dilation.<br><br>So if all energy is kinetic that would mean all energy is matter. Then you might ask yourself what differentiates matter from energy. And as we know the answer is motion. But what differentiates matter from nothing.?<br><br>Charge.!<br><br>Charge is all that stands between something and nothing. Then you might ask well you&#39;d have to be something in order to have charge in the first place. And that&#39;s true enough. But that&#39;s because the constituent parts of three-dimensional space is something.<br><br>Compressed units of Space define charge. And as soon as you have charged. You have the step process. And if you have the step process. You have motion. And if you have motion. You have energy.!<br><br>If you have comprehended and understood what I have put down. Then you should immediately realize all energy is motion. And that it is that motion that makes matter energy. And it is this function that negate the possibility of both the Higgs and Flux tube.<br><br>Mass is acquired through it&#39;s motion. And it&#39;s vector acquire through fundamental forces. Which maintain its efficiencies. allowing its continued existence in that form.<br><br>This turned out to be a little bit longer then I was first trying to describe. But every time I attempt to abbreviate this explanation it just makes it harder to understand.<br><br>I tried to explain it as best as possible well keeping it as short as possible. I&#39;m not sure I did either very well. But if you have understood then you understand it&#39;s true importance.<br><br>And if information you think you already know is conflicting.

Mass creates irregularities in the spacetime coordinate system. We call these irregularities &quot;gravity&quot;. (So far, I&#39;m not making anything up. In Einstein&#39;s model, gravity is not a force. Instead, it&#39;s a coordinate system deformation. Einstein envisioned a four-dimensional system. Three of those dimensions are the 3D we&#39;re already familiar with. Those three dimensions are all at right angles to each other. The fourth dimension is time, pointing to the future and the past, which is also at a right angle to all of the other three. Don&#39;t try to picture what it looks like, because it&#39;s impossible to &quot;visualize&quot;. Anyway, in Einstein&#39;s model, when gravity is observed, the &quot;time&quot; dimension is no longer at a 90 degree angle to the spacial dimensions. It actually &quot;leans&quot; into space. The Moon doesn&#39;t orbit Earth because there&#39;s a force pulling it to Earth. Rather, Earth&#39;s gravitational field, which is not a force, alters the Moon&#39;s &quot;future&quot; axis in such a way that its future is intrinsically bound to the spacial dimensions. And since we know that mass resists forces, and this deflection scales up with mass [a little too convenient], we classically attribute this deflection to a force that scales up with mass. Incorrectly.) This gravity has the potential to alter the trajectory of all sorts of things. And there must be some &quot;cost&quot; for influencing this, because it&#39;s very influential. Even light appears to curve because of gravity.<br><br>A gravity well moving constantly in a straight line (or a geodesic in relativity) doesn&#39;t cost anything because its straight-line trajectory is the same as not moving at all (see: relativity, tensor transformations). The only time the gravity well really changes for all observers is when it&#39;s accelerated. Or &quot;shoved&quot;, if you will. The coordinate system resists being shoved, because that&#39;s fair. It literally influences everything.<br><br>So I don&#39;t think of it as moving mass. I think of it as moving gravity wells.<br><br>Now, as for why mass creates gravity wells, whoops looks I&#39;m out of time.

The mechanism these scientists have identified, the Higgs Boson field that confers mass to energy, is an absurdity with contractions. If it is the Higgs Field mechanism that confers mass to energy how then does a photon with a higher frequency gain greater momentum than a photon with a lower frequency of vibration? In other words the Higgs Field mechanism does not account consistently for statis mass and inertial mass, or the inertial mass of a particle that is not engaged by the Higgs Field. Also, how does the Higgs mechanism work to confer gravitation mass when its range of interaction is so small and gravitational forces work over such great distances?  If you study the attributes of gauge Bosons you see that they conjecture that the Higgs Boson confers mass to other elementary particles that have mass, but there is still no particle or mechanism that confers a gravitational force to particles that have mass, when the gravitational force is proportional to the masses involved, and inversely to the distances between the masses. No one has found a &#39;graviton&#39; particle yet they claim to have detected gravitational waves. And this is another unproven conjecture, they say some particle ( the yet undiscovered &#39;graviton&#39; ) will confer the force of gravity and that as well they have proven that there is no all pervasive aether to carry gravitational waves, yet they say all of space is occupied with a gluon foam that can both supply energy to particle interactions when needed and which draws energy into the binding force they say exists and which also confers mass to particles. In this assertion they are equating the strong nuclear force - mechanism involved with quantum chromodynamics with the mechanism that also involves gravity.  Is it so hard to realize then that gravity operating over great distances has no way of being transmitted by the mechanism they have identified as creating its sole remaining variable, that of mass, unless it is the imaginary gluon foam (energy field) that they now say pervades all of space? And if a gluon foam pervades all of space why is it not detectable when gravity waves are detectable? Why is there no way of detecting a &#39;gluon foam&#39; wind? But I know how they will deal with this set of half baked theories, they will build an even larger particle collider, costing trillions, which will search for and in a few years will find yet another imaginary sub atomic particle responsible for gravity, who&#39;s qualities they will make up from this ever expanding fantasy conjecture world. Bottom line is that they are making all this stuff up, it is un-testable, un-verifiable, and the only criteria they feel they need adhere to is to have some esoteric mathematical model that conforms behaviorally to various parts of their conjectures.", "comment_date": "2019-01-09T18:19:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JiminyPopapill", "comment_text": "How are electrons slowed by the higg&#39;s field?", "comment_date": "2019-01-09T15:10:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Russell K.

I want to know if should continue working on this research paper or my ideas and interpretations are not realistic?<br><br>Here are my views in a detail,<br><br>Abstract<br>The standard model of particles describes the different particles based on their properties, in which Higgs boson was not yet discovered. On 4 July 2012, the Large Hadron Collider found the remaining particle \u201cthe Higgs Boson.\u201d Following the existence of Higgs boson, the proof for the existence of Higgs field was also found. The theory of Higgs field defines mass as the result of the interaction of fundamental particles with the Higgs field. The interaction resists the fundamental particles from traveling at the speed of light. The process of encountering resistance due to Higgs field is when an object gains mass. The mass due to Higgs field is not its own mass. All the particles of the universe are massless by themselves. The mass known currently is due to Higgs field as Higgs field is present universally. <br><br><br>Introduction<br>Today in the 21st century, we measure something in two forms \u201cMass and Weight.\u201d Mass is the amount of matter in the substance. Whereas Weight is the effect of gravitation force on the mass of an object. We have studied that anything that has mass and occupies space is matter. According to our current understanding of particle physics, a proton is made up of 2 up quarks, and 1 down quark and these quarks are bound together by gluons. The mass when combined with 2 up quarks and 1 down quarks should be equal to the mass of the proton, as gluons are massless. But this combined mass is only 1 % of the total mass of the proton. The remaining 99% mass of the proton is due to the energy of the gluons known as quantum chromodynamics binding energy. Through the mass composition, we can conclude that the energy is equal to mass as mass is due to the energy of gluons. Because the mass is due to the quantum chromodynamics binding energy of gluons they should be considered the matter. Contrast to these mathematical calculations, the current theory of particle physics describes gluons as massless. Due to the inconsistency of data, I conclude that the definition of matter is wrong. Thus, proving the currently known mass of proton wrong according to E=Mc2 as the energy and mass are interchangeable in certain conditions but not equal.  As the definition of mater was crafted when the Higgs field was not yet discovered, the definition becomes invalid after the L.H.C discovered the Higgs boson on 4 July 2012. Following the discovery of Higgs boson the Higgs field was proven to have existed, as Higgs boson is an excitation in the Higgs field. After the Higgs field was confirmed to exist, its properties hold true after that. The most important property of the Higgs field is that it gives mass to fundamental particles when interacting with the Higgs field. For example, proton\u2019s mass was measured when the Higgs field was not yet then discovered, so the mass of proton measured was in the presence of Higgs field. This implies that the mass measured was due to the interaction with the Higgs field and not the own respective mass of the proton. This theory holds true for everything which has mass according to our current understanding of measurement of mass.<br> As all particles are made up of fundamental particles, so when the particle for example proton interacts with the Higgs field, the fundamental particles that make up the proton also interact as a proton is a name given to the composition of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark held together by gluons. The properties of Higgs field states that any fundamental particle when interacts with the Higgs field, it generates mass. Thus, concluding that the mass of a proton is due to Higgs field.", "comment_date": "2017-12-02T09:11:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hedning1390", "comment_text": "So, does a beam of light attract another beam of light through gravity?

Without assuming that quark field disturbances propagate at the speed of light, how can we determine the propagation speed through the mechanics of quarks and quark fields? To my knowledge, the quarks and quark fields (or gluons) are primarily (if not the only thing) responsible for the strong nuclear interactions, A.K.A. the strong nuclear force. But the strong force interaction is limited to a distance on the order of 1 femtometer (10^ -15 m). We obviously do not have the microscopic technology to probe disturbances in the quark field to that scale; so then, how can we, experimentally or through a process of deduction determine the propagation speed of what I would call &quot;quark waves&quot;?<br><br>Another way for me to ask the same question is this: The electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space determine the speed of light. But these properties of space are related to the electron field. Is there such thing as a &quot;quark field permittivity&quot; and &quot;quark magnetic permeability&quot; of free space which determine the propagation speed of quark waves? If so, then how could we determine if they equate to or are different from the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability for the electron field?<br><br>IF quark waves were experimentally determined to propagate faster than the speed of light, would the capabilities to manipulate (amplify and extend the interaction distance of) quark waves enable us, theoretically, to break the light barrier, not through the manipulation of electromagnetic forces but through the manipulation of quark field disturbances (or through the manipulation of the quark permittivity and quark permeability)?<br><br>Thanks!", "comment_date": "2017-09-15T23:29:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Inson", "comment_text": "That&#39;s not really an answer though is it.

This is true for the proton AND\u00a0for the electron. Why? Restmass (particle nearly at rest within its\u00a0center of structure) is made from &quot;hidden internal, inertial dynamics&quot; mainly - you might call this matter-wave-generation or matter-waves internal interactions. This is obviously clear for the quarks (matter-waves)\u00a0interaction (interacting by strong, weak, and electro-magnetic force) within a proton. But this holds true for the electron restmass too of course without having quarks but having\u00a0internal dynamic structure (dynamic space-time-curvature). So you simply need to give up the point particle hypothesis for the electron particle. If not, you fail to calculate the restmass of the electron. The key to understand this is if you complete\u00a0the QED+QCD by GR+TD. Then you can derive the main part\u00a0contribution\u00a0to mass of the\u00a0&quot;free&quot; (no external field-interaction available) electron relatively at rest by using Einstein&#39;s Theory.

We learn that electrons only look like they have mass because of the drag they experience while moving through the Higgs field surrounding them.  Sounds good until you realize that electrons still have mass when they are motionless!  The Higgs field is completely imaginary as was the ether theory of the 19th century, imo.  As for protons being &quot;made up&quot; of quarks is concerned, it never ceases to amaze me that particle physicists never consider the possibility that quarks have no independent existence in nature, but are only momentarily created when proton abuse takes place inside of a particle collider because the energy needed for such collisions does not occur in the real universe.  I think one should be wary of any physical models fabricated from a zoo-like collection of <i>ad hoc</i> subatomic particles.  Note that the collisions between the protons are always head to head in the particle colliders.  Maybe changing the angle of the collisions or further increasing their energies (poor protons!) would then result in a completely different collection of &quot;fundamental&quot; particles being collected for the particle physicists&#39; zoo.  Then, we have a final embarrassing question to ask.  Has anything practical ever come out of all of this expensive high energy particle research?  Has it allowed us, for example, to artificially control the gravitational and inertial properties of matter? No. Has it allowed us to generate all of the energy we need with &quot;cold fusion&quot;? No. Has it allowed us to disintegrate waste to get rid of it?  No.  Other than providing some employment for physicists, I have not seen much come out of it in decades.

Being somewhat knowledgeable about the history of the development of Quantum theories I have noticed that while it does become more elaborate over time, giving smaller scale explanations for what is seen at larger scales, at any point in the history the explanation leaves unexplained whatever is at that time claimed to be the reason for all the claims at the next higher scale and on up.  They drill down and down, building a framework of higher level explanations, but are mystified by whatever happens to be at the bottom of the hole at that time.  However, history shows that there is a tendency to claim &quot;aha&quot; , this bottom of the hole is it.  Of course they will also say more funds are needed to see if the hole can be dug deeper.  And they get the funds and dig deeper, and after a little digging say &quot;aha&quot; again.  This pattern keeps repeating.  I see no conjectures or theories offered as to how it may one day be known that the true bottom of the hole has been reached.   So I opine that the true bottom of the hole will become &quot;true&quot; only when a lot of time, maybe a century has passed since the last time someone said &quot;aha&quot;.  <br><br>Meanwhile, at any point in this history, parrots learn to repeat the words they last heard with religious assertiveness, seemingly unaware that the bottom of the hole has not been reached, and the next &quot;aha&quot; is going to change the storyline to some degree, making the parrots words obsolete.   I don&#39; t mean totally obsolete, I just mean that the parrot will have to learn some new phrases and forget some already learned. <br><br>I don&#39;t mean this as a put down to the quantum physicists.....of course what they do is amazing.   But let me add a second observation.   50  or more years ago the common phrase was &quot; scientists will one day unlock the secrets of the universe&quot; and that was always said with a hopeful tone, as if after unlocking the last most diffucult to crack locks some fantastic knowledge would be gained that would usher in a utopia more utopian than ever imagined, bringing unlimted energy and abundance to all, and even the knowledge itself would blanket humanity with a kind of ultimate bliss.    It is disappointing to me that what quantum theory says, more and more, is that things are such that only totally impractical and unreachable levels of energy are needed to change anything, for instance to change lead into gold or to make a new stable element with amazingly useful and beneficial properties.   Of course some useful, beneficial knowledge has come from all this, but IMO rather little compared to all the fine details that have been explained.  We have nuclear medicine...a useful but limited invention.   We have nuclear power, but it has serious drawbacks and the uranium supply is limited.   We have xray inspection of steel structures to detect flaws.   And of course there is nano-tech, but that&#39;s all at the atom level....manipulation of atoms that has produced a little bit of useful tech and may produce more but what&#39;s that got to do with gluons?   For the most part what we know now about &quot;the secrets of the universe&quot; is a bit of a downer, as it points as I mentioned to little good news ahead, due to energy level limitations.  In other words it looks like it is what it is, what we hoped it was not, namely, more or less unchangeable and without much promise. <br><br>Much, much more promise seems to lie in the fields of bio-tech and computing.

I have heard in your video, a hot cup of tea has a higher mass, I think if the tea holds temperature (then energy must have been added from an outside energy source first (tea doesn&#39;t boil on its own it wants to rest in its own preferred neutral to its surroundings rest state of existence), therefore when temperature or energy is added from outside, the atoms are colliding more and creating extra temperature, yet in total the tea looses energy and cools down (the tea cup is not fully confined or sealed off, so no pressure builds, the energy or temperature is released from the fluid, real atoms are leaving the substance or fluid as steam, or smaller) and so the smaller residual total atoms count in the cup cool to and lose energy in total, but cooling makes the remaining atoms in the cup move relatively slower again, and the influence of gravity on the remaining atoms is then relatively a little bigger than before, the slower they move the more relative time per cycle or spin they are actually falling down (instead of a cetrifugal force (the spin can neutralize its own weight if enough energy is applied in the form of temperature) combined with heat that wants to go up and cool, seeking space) and weighing down more fully with its potential, the mass becomes relatively higher per unit (closed spherical dimension of/on any scale, even particles have an inner and an outer dimension whether we can observe this or not) as the energy total, or total temperature drops. When earth was to cool, its total mass would become higher per total of our same mass, making us seem more heavy, slow us down and it would probably move in a lower orbit around the sun, more hanging under its solar horizon.The suns mass having a harder time attracting us with the same push (ejection of all (dark) mass (matter) hitting us) or input of power in the form of temperature brought here litteraly inside the small form of matter), see in your garden under your flowerpots how bright it remained not being touched by &quot;light&quot; while surrounding this light spot is all darkened).<br><br>Now any particle can only hold so much total energy (depending on properties like absolute size in real space to hold energy in), or temperature it can hold before it must emit something (release of temperature/energy, in the form of heat (glow) or eventually even light in various strengths), heat it up far enough and it will glow or transmit light itself (excess temperature released by emanating from a particle). How much can this or any particle hold without radiating, what is its energy holding potential. If atoms are exited more they&#39;re mass is less, they are busy colliding creating temperature inside its own closed off separated dimension (the more protons - neutrons, the more temperature can be carried in these balloons/particles/dimensions, the more pressure it can withstand, the lighter it becomes, more heat in its total, more upward force, the more spin, the more centrifugal force to neutralize its total weight as a system, the less time to actually fall, or be influenced by gravity) or common density that want to rise (inside the atoms and per atom or even smaller basis) and fights gravity individually, how ever small it seems to matter. If each single atom did this, it would certainly have an total upward effect (or I don&#39;t know a higher percentage of influence gained from the cetrifugal force? Or all just tiny hot air balloons seeking to cool or normalize individually, back to their favored temperature for existence), hotter is seemingly lighter or thought of as having less mass, it weighs less on a scale by an individual atomic upward force? <br><br>Now the other way around, in space all atoms we find there (water atoms but not many, not enough pressure or temperature to allow for atomic particle bindings? Empty space is not &quot;empty&quot; something dark contains dark energy or temperature, just not enough to reveal its actual position to us in the form of light or actual signals we can detect. Anything there is slow and the individual mass of particles have a relative much longer time now to fall, because slower to assert its weight downward or to fall (the further from earth the slower you fall back until we don&#39;t notice it anymore? Einstein gravity well times 2 on top of each other seems a lot like a atmosphere wherein (all!) falls back to earths gravity centre where the most pressure is locally in absolute space...), inertia , I think space around us everywhere, in and outside of our atmosphere is filled with dark matter (boson sized?) that&#39;s hard to find (unable to tell us of its presence by the suns steady power supply in cold space, not enough surface area to hold enough temperature), we only see it on a distance as dark matter sometimes containing temperature in that matter we think of as dark energy we can&#39;t really account for, I think its energy or temperature inside matter, dark or not. Lit or not. Its so light in its single form, so absent of surface area, it might not be able to light up to our human need to see or find it. It might be everywhere and we could not feel it in its single form. <br><br>A sort of atmospheric fog or haze like we see in blue on earth, must also be present in space, the more matter between you and the source must create some sort of to dark to find in dark on dark, not big enough, or solid enough to reflect, not big enough to impact on, or not big enough to contain enough heat to even allow it to radiate in cold space. A dark fogginess for light, only visible from a far while being in it, giving it an hypothetical maximum distance it could travel three the grains (explaining background radiation..), at a certain starting given starting energy (from a certain sun, they are diverse in mass, probably also in energy they release via the dark matter it ejects (sun is source of dark matter, similar to a blacklight (uv A - uv B) with focus like a laser that works only on impact) as the fully burnt, under high pressure so small sized, low relative mass by temperature, nuclear waste it actually is that becomes in a photon state after it leaves the sun, visible as its local glow, then loses energy, its carried temperature in cold space is then lost BUT NOT its velocity gained by ejection from pressure, as matter tends to keep moving when no friction is experienced. It is our atmosphere that&#39;s filled with relative to space more matter in it that is the lights (particle) speed limiting factor (there&#39;s no limiting atmosphere at the sun so how fast are\u00a0 they really if measured in space to space over a long distance , no atmospheres passed?). We imposed the speed of light, measured Always partly on earth under atmospheric pressure and made this a universal speedlimit for all of matters possible states. If we send lasers to the moon, it still travels from our atmosphere to the moon and back again to our atmosphere, already being limited to the speed WE are able to give it from inside our atmosphere. A photon literally becomes relatively more light (less relative mass) by induced heat, or by moving thru a higher temperature than is normal in space seen from perspective of space (like an atmosphere we have).<br><br>On impact with actual matter (like earths denser / thicker than space atmosphere) then we can see this impact as the effect light locally, here on earth.), or relative high ejection velocity (releasing pressure or temperature it can not hold from the particle as fast as it can by seeking cooling space and releasing matter or light as fast as it can to release this temperature or pressure), holding a certain value for its weight per absolute size or dimension it takes up in absolute space, because it is so fine grained and unable to be exited enough by the suns particles ejected from it in space where it is a low starting temperature, and on earth there is the atmospheric pressure again to form more complex (actual realworld bigger surface size to reflect or impact on, meaning more temperature transferred from the impact with the photon by the photon), more easy to be seen relative more solid matter forming and becoming more and more solid up until the apex of all combined matters pressure on the core, forming our centre of gravity for inside our atmosphere. Only on earth itself inside our atmosphere is the fire triangle complete, to form actual light.<br><br>On earth we find more complex particle configurations like atoms (a oxygen percentage needed to burn on earth, easily inflammable @100% so a good medium for photons ability to exist), and no black on black background filled with darkness, or dark superfine (variable mass per absolute taken space) mass) matter to reflect on big enough to generate temperatures we can see or tell apart from each other.We might measure it in an relative inert, relative low temperature, single form and measure a relative small mass, because it is part of a total (medium, mix of particles sharing the same properties inside a separate dimension of gravity (I know we don&#39;t know of an enclosure but it must be somewhere, the shockwave might be still happening as we are expanding :) )) pressure on our atmosphere. If the collisions in space are low, the local temperature is low, the energy seems low to us but might not be able to radiate in space but indeed might be able to on earth, with a higher starting temperature that allows for more easy release of temperature thru emitting of light. In space there&#39;s -270 degrees, here there is a normal to us pressure and common temperature, its energy spread out over the earth, holding up our atmosphere by pressure on the balloon. In space there is almost no matter to exited or reflect of, on earth there is plenty of solid matter to reflect on and generate he totally inside our atmosphere. Maybe pressure is the thing we call gravity now (all the cold matter in space&#39;s weighs truly down (Heavier for its size but to all sides(inert), forming pressure on matter from all sides equally an simulated or artificial thickness from matter so fine we can&#39;t see it,\u00a0 the pressure is a variable for mass it seems. <br><br>More pressure is more temperature is lighter material by atoms that fight gravity, heat wants to cool, want to go up to the atmosphere where it has room (space)to cool. If this happens on an per atom/particle/atmosphere basis this could mean that because space is so cold it could have a relative high mass (influence of slowly falling) for an in findable small particle (black on black is hard to see, and the sun might even be spitting out these tiny black unfindeble single particles with a high velocity, its a chemical nuclear powerhouse with super pressures, might it spit out the most weightless of weightless black particles (that get a relative mass from slowing down after being ejected and long enough under the influence of space temperature), the sun is hot and might make the tiniest of tiniest particles relative lighter for its size by its pressure exerted around the core of the sun and then being ejected so hard that it looses its temperature away from the locality of the sun, and cools down until it can no longer emit or radiate there, but still enormously fast but now with a relative HIGHer mass for a small particle holding this much temperature in this small size (maybe light traveling is a relatively slow velocity from the universes perspective, it is used to no friction mostly), impacting on our atmosphere and creating local temperature in our hot thermosphere on impact, together with the effect we call light, the excitement or giving off of energy, like a laser does on impact explaining dark matter (a mass that does not hold enough temperature or carries enough energy to be able to light up in space but is able to do this inside our atmosphere and be visible as light for humans.)<br><br>Now... Take a completely matte black billiard 8ball (no white on it) to space, it reflects nothing but absorbs all light. Look at it from a distance at any angle in the dark black on black space, if you find it you will see a circle, or a hole.... From any side!.....\u00a0 The missing light info can&#39;t tell us it is (atmos) spherical.... Two of Einsteins gravity wells together on top of each other is describing an atmosphere where in everything falls back to the centre of gravity, our surface is just in the way (to break your fall before you reach it). An artist drawing a ball simulates 3 dimensionality with help of how he thinks light should fall on a spherical shape... If we don&#39;t have this information you see a black circle or a black hole from any side, under any angle...... We are looking at a 2 dimensional picture from a telescope..... And no local light information.... blackhole... Is a sphere (maybe it even signals the presence of an atmosphere, if we on earth had enormous volcanic action inside our atmosphere, light might be able to enter or is absorbed on its way in, but light might not reach back out after impact or reflection of a surface.... We would look like a blackhole from Mars, wouldn&#39;t we Mister Occam?)....\u00a0 Super much heat inside an atmosphere might also simulate a thicker atmospheric border filled with particles, light would be hindered trying to come into the atmosphere by super active spinning atoms increasing the chance of a hit, and just like on re entry, the photon is put to extremes, it starts to radiate again, gaining temperature by friction with matter, and gained temperature is transported IN matter, which it takes along with it, inside it, during its distances traveled, the medium partly dictates glow or not possible. Any matter we can separate from each other has its own known dimension, with a inner and a outer dimension, being able to contain temperature inside it.<br><br>Funny after thought, <br><br>Did Mister Einstein Think Of 2d (A to B) Earth! Travel Over Surfaces For 3Dimensional Mass Moving True 3Dimensional Space!, Experiencing Three Times More The minimum Surface area equals more friction, Undergoing more Resistance (Pi? 3 times is minimum 3.14 is special somehow? Unlimited? Like space?) in space we can travel not only from A to B but we have C plus D and E anyways over 3 axis. Wouldn&#39;t E= movement (in space) so E(space)= M(3).C(3).Pi3? Pi for resistance of surface or medium I guess? I don&#39;t know how to explain this yet ill think about it some more, I am no mathematician.... But you&#39;ll figure it out Im sure. Maybe Einstein thought of surface travel on earth from point A to B over a road and forgot he went to space where he can move in all 6 directions over 3 axis. The closer we come to the sun the more pressure we experience, the more we will be pushed away by its local temperature I think., we will/would tremble so much on an atomic level, we would have a hard time flying straight. (The Meissner effect on the sun? Now working on visible light, Bending light away (first deflect by push, or pressure created by local temperature) and pulling with its mass or centre of gravity again back around it by gravities pull-force working on the mass that passes it by, which is relative high per particle in the cold of space per absolute size? So much effect in slow cold space because the mass is relative heavy in space and is what bends (pulls, gravitational pull)) the light back after passage has taken place. Maybe this is lensing. The slower stuff moves relative, the more influence anything can have on it!. So a relative HIGH Mass (a super dense planet) can influence a relative passing slow for nature photon (or particle in neutrino state, not glowing), or by pulling it does it become visible at all, we see the light being pulled under an angle like light being bend in a water stream that falls seems bend. If it (planet) could not influence the light we would not even notice the black body at all from the same distance. <br><br>Magnetism also seems to work on relative small temperatures (on microscopic particles experiencing micro gravitational effects) creating a flow of energy or movement on a super tiny (invisible to the eye is their reach of influence, we can only feel the effect as it works on particles so small they are unable to be seen) scale. When I see the charts or lines, I imagine weather charts with streams or higher and lower pressure zones. Einstein said Energy is Movement, I say yes Energy is movement, of matter ( solid enough is visible or single invisible) flowing between relative temperatures from hot to cold, seeking its preferred rest state of existence, normalization or harmonization with its surrounding according to natures absolute laws we experience in our part (dimension) of space. Anything can only cool off to space its zero temperature if no new energy is added, this explains the spiral galaxy arms, the further away, the less energy, the less temperature, the less visibility/ measurabilitie on a distance by us, the longer path of resistance traveled, the less velocity, the MORE influence space has or gets on it and slowing it (anything) down, while the rest keeps turning slowly. The closer to the source (Omni directional, spherical bigbang but light in the other direction is long gone and moving away never to be seen again, no information will ever reach us back but the big bang is no cone shape. It is an explosion (Omni directional bigbang with shockwave (like a Big explosion on earth lowers the air pressure or absolute atom count inside a omnispherical zone or bubble instantly to us,\u00a0 as we weren&#39;t even here to witness this that long ago) separating space from space creating a different atmosphere inside of a sphere with different properties, in omnidirectional space in all directions, and this light that moved away to the opposite side is never to be seen ever again, its information for ever lost to us.\u00a0 Seen from our side of the explosion the moved away matter and light has long given of effect by impact or lost existence in cold space and lost all energies turning to dark inert matter forming systems when possible. The possibly more heavy displaced by the bigbang (exploded sun leaving behind a super dense heavy metal core\u00a0 but is no longer visible as all Original first light and matter at the highest released energies has passed us by a long time ago) space might be flowing back to the centre at the same time.<br><br>A tiny particle with lots of energy in it that can&#39;t actually release temperature or its energy fast enough is like a photon, but put the same energy in a much bigger object, or a planet, this same total energy seems way less spread out evenly over a much bigger object. Or mass being the same particles with a shared shape (its own separate dimension) and density. If a spacecraft had very big lasers converging\u00a0 in front of its intended flight path, it could actually create a local temperature that pushes or folds away space particles in front of it by outward pressure, giving it a clearest path possible.\u00a0 (wasn&#39;t the folding of space mentioned somewhere in some book before?)<br><br><br>Bit of a long question sorry :) love this channel...", "comment_date": "2015-06-15T07:28:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JimBiskas DEB", "comment_text": "what does give light mass?", "comment_date": "2015-06-13T15:33:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meliponicultura en Costa Rica", "comment_text": "I was thinking of your last example, do you know how much more mass does the sun have due to having more energy? as compared to regular H and He<br>since the sun gets to several milion \u00baC, it may be significant..?", "comment_date": "2015-06-12T14:36:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ilia L", "comment_text": "Finishing my first year of theoretical physics degree.
