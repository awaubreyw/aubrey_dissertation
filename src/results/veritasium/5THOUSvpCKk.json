Light is not a particle. Light is more like a ghost, the only evidence of its&#39; existence is its&#39; effect. Try to catch some light in a clay pot. You caught nothing, it was gone before you got it. Don&#39;t even think about light having a begining or end or life span. Light doesn&quot;t have a perspective or aspect point. Light is everywhere and nowhere. Light is the moment of Gods self awareness projected as the universe. Your question is unanswerable.
