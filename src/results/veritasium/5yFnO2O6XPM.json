Humans have domesticated dogs within the last 10,000 years. Yet, all the breeds we know of today are from within the last few centuries. If we go back a thousand years ago, there was really only one type of dog. So, let&#39;s assume that all the breeds, even those that are less than 100 years old, have been evolving from this original breed for a thousand years. Considering that life has been evolving on Earth for 3.5 billion years, if 1,000 years were 1 mm, then 3.5 billion years would be 3 and a half kilometers long.

Two observations come to mind when thinking about it. First, it clearly has a designer as well as a builder. I don&#39;t believe for a moment that this computer could appear on its own from matter given 1 year or 4 million years. It required intelligence to conceive and produce it. My second observation is that this computer is designed for a purpose. Although I can take it outside and try to mow the lawn with it, I&#39;m confident my efforts will fail. <br><br>I often ask people after choosing a few items of varying complexity to compare to the human body which is more complex, the items I chose or the human body? Of course the answer always comes back that the human body is the most complex. It&#39;s interesting to note that people have no problem accepting intelligent design when looking at the varying man made objects that surround us, yet the idea is dismissed when we consider the creation of mankind. Maybe the truth is we don&#39;t want to be held accountable for our actions. If we have a creator, then we are created for a purpose. <br><br>Imagine a master painter that is your personal friend. He paints for you an amazing piece of art as a gift and gives it to you in a beautiful frame to hang on your wall. Time passes and you purchase a parrot. You spend additional money on a large cage to keep your parrot in. Not wanting to soil the cage bottom from the parrot&#39;s waste, you realize that you need something to protect it. Looking at your wall you notice that the painting your friend gave you would cover the bottom of the cage perfectly  and so you slip it into the cage. <br><br>Months later, your master painter friend returns to visit you. While looking around your home he sees many of your favorite  pictures mounted on the walls yet wonders where his might be? He enters the room containing your parrot&#39;s cage and discovers his art at the bottom.  How do you suppose the painter would feel to see his painting desecrated on the floor of your bird cage?    <br><br>Evolution vs. Creation. Both ideas are accepted by faith. How do we know this? The answer lies within the definition of science...&quot;the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.&quot; No one observed the earth at its time of origin.
