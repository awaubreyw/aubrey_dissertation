Clearly half the distance does not need to happen at half the time. And the current speed at half distance and half time does not need to be the average speed. The video does not mention how to calculate the average speed when half the distance is not covered in half the time. In my understanding if the second half of the distance is covered in one quarter of the time then first half of the distance is covered at half the speed for the total distance. The explanation also does not look at the more general case of accelerating from 0 speed.

But wait a minute this is not how average speed is calculated right ?<br>its total distance / total time <br>60/(3+1) = 15km/hr ,  here we are getting a <b>*smaller*</b> value but what would happen if we assume our average speed to still be 20km/hr let see what happens to the left side 60/(3+t2) = 20, we get t2 = 0, i.e, we have to cover the second part in no time or we have to achieve infinite speed which is practically impossible.", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T20:33:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kamiziat K", "comment_text": "Pinpong balls are a neutral element because they act the same way as air bubbles in the bottle", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T19:39:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rahul Singh", "comment_text": "can not we just change trime for second run..wont that work since dist is const", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T17:46:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pierre Baudhuin", "comment_text": "1\u00b0 lap : I run at 15km/h<br>2\u00b0 lap : I run at 45km/h<br>AVG : 60/2 = 30 km/h , which is twice v1 (15km/h) .

What&#39;s your name? nice work you&#39;re doing with your channel. <br>How about a video on what happens after the death? What is the purpose of our existence. <br>OR another Idea:<br>I personally think, that and it is not just a belief; it is a calculated thought, that our universe, is not physical at all, but it is a state of mind. It is a perception. Nothing physical is actually physical at all. Our universe Itself, does actually NOT exist on physical plane, although it is very convincing through our 5 senses that i does. I came up to this idea, as I was thinking about the size of the universe.  That is also by the way why I said that it is somewhat calculated thought. The thought about the physical size of universe is, that the universe cannot possibly have a physical size, at all; it is impossible! <br>Why, you ask? <br>The reason is that for any particular object under observation to be measured against its physical size, we have to determine its boundaries; its corners; the line which determines its confines; something that tells us that okay, let&#39;s say a box has 6 walls. Each of the wall has an ending point where its last atoms will be occupying the physical space of the box. After which, there will be no more atoms of that box, but just air. So there is a line, a wall, a boundary of any kind or state of matter; be it liquid and solid  boundary, as in beach and sand. Or be it water sprinkled in air. Every water drop has its boundary until the surrounding air starts. <br><br>The universe my friend, cannot possibly has a boundary. Let us assume for a second that it does have a boundary, be it in the plasma, solid, gaseous or liquid state; There will always be something outside of that boundary/wall/line. <br>Let&#39;s go another step further, assuming even one more thing that the boundary is a loop, like our Earth (which seems straight by our 5 senses but is actually round, and we cannot escape due to its very round nature, gravity and atmosphere and many other factors), even in that very case, if we are in a whirlpool kind of swirling medium which confines the universe, still there universe will not end there. Because there will always be something outside of this swirling, captivating, encompassing, confining medium... <br>So we start walking in the right dimension, (e.g. going upper direction on earth)  the physical space is infinite. After the farthest galaxy we will find 1 billion years later, and even after our existence, there will always be something next to it. <br>It simply means, that it is not the physical space that exists; it is the perception of it which does!<br><br>I would love you to make a nice, well thought, well organised, with no drama or dramatic music in the background,  but just well discussed and well-argumented video about this topic... nobody has found the answer of it; I do not expect you to have it either; what I want you to do is, to try finding one...", "comment_date": "2021-01-12T21:43:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrHunterseeker", "comment_text": "Eh, you explained the train part wrong.

I got it right. My answer was &quot;A liquid with something heavy that floats; like rubber in water...&quot; or pingpong balls in honey. My answer was as vague as it was because it&#39;s absolutely impossible to know the exact liquid and object, as liquids with different consistencies can produce the exact safe effect by using different objects which are affected by the liquid to the same extent as those pingpong balls in honey. I only gave that example in case anyone reading (say a small child) couldn&#39;t understand the concept I was referring to. <br><br>2? No, 3. <br>I&#39;m shocked that you got this wrong. Honestly I would be less shocked if you were trying to argue that you caught a mistake in a physics formula that\u2019s been around since at least 330BC when Aristotle published about it, but the fact that you not knowing how to do the math lead you to that conclusion just baffles me. I have no idea how you could be unable to do that basic arithmetic in your head and need to write it all out in the first place, but even less how you could come to that conclusion after writing it out. This wasn&#39;t even a riddle, anyone who knows the basic logic of how reality functions knows the answer intuitively, and that logic can be expressed using elementary math. <br><br>Not to mention &quot;speed&quot; and &quot;velocity&quot; are different things, although velocity is dependent on speed. Velocity is a vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object changes its position, speed is a scalar quantity that refers to how fast an object is moving. In any case I\u2019ll explain why traveling 3 times faster is the answer, and how to get the time of the second lap needed to achieve that using the formula for speed, then give an example. <br><br>The goal is to have an average speed after 2 laps which is equal to double the speed of your first lap, and speed is your average distance over time. \u201cAverage\u201d is the concept that there is something which is the most common in a set of things, we quantify an average by quantifying a set of things then taking their sum and dividing by the number of variables in the set. So the average speed that someone takes to run a lap around a course using data from 2 laps would be half of the the sum of those speeds. <br><br>In order to have an average speed that\u2019s twice as fast as half of the sum of your 2 speeds, you need the sum of those speeds to be 4 times faster than the speed of your first lap. That means that you indeed need to be 3 times faster on your second lap than on your first. Just like I answered on your last video, and like you initially said on this video you made after reading many comments pointing that out. <br><br>To solve this mathematically you first have to consider the situation. In the proposed question distance is constant, because it\u2019s the same in both laps around the track. So obviously the factor that has to change is time. As any elementary school student can tell you: If you divide something by a number 1/2 the size it\u2019ll have a quotient twice as large, and obviously the quotient of a dividend divided by the quotient of thrice itself and some divisor results in a value 1/3 of the size of the divisor. <br><br>To put it mathematically: <br>(1st s + 2nd s) / 2 = 2*1st s \u21d2 1st s + 2nd s = 2*2*1st s \u21d2 2nd s = 4*1st s - 1st s = 3*1st s (3s)<br>(s + 3s) / 2 = 4s / 2 = 2s <br>s = d / t \u21d2 3s = 3d / t = d / (t / 3)<br>s = d / t \u21d2 t = d / s <br>Time of second lap = d / (3d / t ) =  dt / 3d = t / 3<br><br>I&#39;ll give you an easy example using the units for speed I grew up with, miles per hour (mph AKA mi/h):<br>If your distance around the track is 1 mile (1mi) and you do the first lap in 15 minutes (15m), then given that there are 60 minutes in an hour your speed is 4mph.<br>d = 1mi, t = 15m, h = m / 60 <br>s = 1mi / 15m = 1mi / (15/60)h = (1/0.25)mi / h = 4mph <br><br>Thus double your speed is 8mph, and triple your speed is 12mph.<br>2s = 2*4mph = 8mph<br>3s = 3*4mph = 12mph<br><br>Therefore the time you need to do the 2nd lap in is 5 minutes.<br>h = m / 60 \u21d2 m = h*60<br>1mi / (12mi / 1h) = 1mi / (12mi / 60m) = 1mi / (0.2mi/m) = (1/0.2)m = 5m<br>1mi / 5m = 1mi / (5/60)h = (1/(1/12))mi / h = 12mph <br><br>If that was too confusing for anyone because I used miles and mph you can make your own euro version of this same example by taking triple your usual time for a kilometer to get a kph for your first lap that makes it possible for you to do it in real life.<br><br>[Other 2 As Reply On This Comment]", "comment_date": "2020-12-17T13:05:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hypericus2", "comment_text": "The flanges on a train wheel are not the main reason a train stays on the track, rather it is the angle of the wheel rim against the rail.

Distance is unchanged. <br>The one many are using is Vmean=(V1+V2)/2, which is actually the MEAN SPEED for this case where you have two different speeds, independently of its value, you can find that Vmean=D/2(1/T1+1/T2), so you can actually solve that to find that if you want Vmean=2V1, then you must have V2=3V1.<br>This means that if you run the same distance 3 times faster than the first lap, the mean speed doubles the speed of the original lap.<br><br>The actual definition of average speed, involves the total distance which is 2D<br>in the total time which is T. Is easy to tell that T=T1+T2.<br>Now if you use this you have that<br>Vavg=2D/(T1+T2),  and here is the tricky part.

Either twice the distance does work just being on a different track- . What am I missing? You don\u2019t have to use the equation you gave. <br><br>When you superimposed two separate events into one equation (the way you did) in the language of numbers you\u2019re suggesting that the two events happened at the same time. Which is why it sounds impossible. <br><br>It seems that the math doesn\u2019t make it impossible but the question/ riddle given makes the math applied irrelevant or not compatible. The question actually has a finite answer- as in it\u2019s not really a riddle- just an every day math problem. <br><br>you just take the TOTAL or whole sum of the first speed or velocity- then ADD that to the total of that same person\u2019s second event; two separate equations, then add or \u201ctotal\u201d them up to receive a sum- then divided that by two and you get the average total- total average. So it would actually be a long equation- v1= d/t (+) v2=d/t divided by 2 (the two separate events= total average velocity <b>measured</b> -calculated. <br><br>So if velocity is distance traveled divided by time- so for the second lap (the question being to get the average which is a comparison of two separate things- as in two separate laps or better two separate events), how could not moving the same distance in faster time not work? <br><br>I\u2019m not understanding saying well you ran the first lap already- to increase something- means to keep going- doesn\u2019t the question imply either a second event or a continuation of the first, so as long as you don\u2019t stop you didn\u2019t actually complete anything you just took a measurement of time? Like a time stamp, like how they do in nascar? I feel this could get into concepts of time doesn\u2019t exist until you measure something between two points. <br><br>If we dive into quantum physics, does it apply that something is technically in a state or place of infinite possibilities until measured?

The average track time is kind of right.  I thought it was simply 3 times your 1st lap speed, but then when I worked it out on paper I realised you have to add your two times (NOT your average speeds) and divide twice the track distance by that.  I used 1km for a lap and used a first lap speed of 1 km per hour.  My first 2nd lap speed I chose 4 kph (15 min to get around), but when you divide 2 km by 1.25 hours you only get 1.6 kph.  Then I used 6 min for the 2nd lap speed, but again, 2 km divided by 1.1 hrs = 1.81818181etc kph.  BUT, the trouble with pure mathematics is it ignores the limitations of the real world -- it&#39;s a bit like the old canard of: if a frog jumps half-way from its current position to a wall (and the wall is say, 3 m away from it when it starts), how many jumps will the frog take to reach the wall?; and the mathematical answer is &quot;never&quot;, but frogs and people are NOT dimensionless points, meaning the frog&#39;s length would mean that it would reach the wall before it died (probably in only an hour or two) -- it can&#39;t keep doing smaller and smaller jumps.  Similarly, with a 2nd lap time of only 1 minute (av. speed of 60 km per hour for that lap), that would give 2 km divided by 1.01666666etc hours = 1.96721etc km per hour.

Think of it like this: A cross-section of the cylinder would look like a wagon wheel. The rim of the wheel is the outside of the cylinder, and the spokes are walls separating the cylinder into 8 chambers. The fluid starts out all in the bottom chamber. As the cylinder rolls, the water filled chamber moves to the back and then begins to lift up. This changes the center of gravity from the horizontal center of the cylinder toward the back of the cylinder, thus arresting forward momentum. If you poke a small hole in each barrier, then the water can begin to slowly flow from the now elevated chamber into the new lowest chamber. Once a sufficient volume of water has moved into the new chamber, the cylinder will be able to roll again, until the center of gravity has changed enough to prevent further forward motion.<br>I have not actually physically tested it, but as a thought experiment it seems to have the same properties. Thus I provided a solution that would accomplish the objective. However, I did not correctly answer the question of how Derek achieved it. Thus I awarded myself half a point.<br><br>Riddle 2: 1 point<br>I wasn&#39;t sure if he was asking for the average speed of 2 laps when the lap is a discrete unit, in which case saying (V1 + V2) / 2 = 2V1 would have been the solution, or if he was asking for the average speed for the time spent running, in which case each lap would be weighted. The first method was fairly easy. I already provided the equation, which when you work it it comes to V2 = 3V1. However I went ahead and worked out the second method as well, since I couldn&#39;t ask for clarification on which method of averaging the riddle was asking for. When I got thinking about the second method I realized that it was asking you to run 2 laps in the same amount of time as running the first lap. IE the second lap would require infinite speed in order to accomplish in 0 time. I further assessed based on the context that the second method (impossible) was more likely than the first method (V2 = 3V1). So a full point there.<br><br>Riddle 3: 0 point<br>The only thing I could think of was the drive piston on the older style steam trains. Completely missed that one.

The whole idea behind a bike is that you move a much greater ground distance than the distance of the pedal. It is pretty much simple machines, levers, and mechanical advantage. The wheel has a much stronger mechanical advantage over the pedal, so the over-all backward pull on the bike (and thus backward torque on the tire) is stronger than the forward force on the pedal.

If you think of this animation with the circle traveling through a/the 3rd dimension, you should/would also create a spiral being formed in midair.

Yes the average<br> velocity is the average of velocities but the average has to be <br>computed in the correct way. The average of two numbers x and y is not <br>always (x+y)/2. In general its p*x+(1-p)*y where p is a number smaller <br>than one. <br><br>For example, we may attribute more weight to the number y  so that the <br>average z may be written as z=x/3+2y/3 with 1/3=p and 2/3=1-1/3=1-p in <br>the formula given above. Let&#39;s take an example. A sprinter runing at a <br>reasonable speed v1 for 2 minutes. that decides to run at a faster speed<br> v2  a tenth of a second before he reaches the finish line. A duration <br>so small that you can&#39;t even see that he moved that much. Would it be <br>reasonable to say that the average speed is (v1+v2)/2 ? No ! You hardly <br>even saw him moving at v2 so you can&#39;t give the same weight to v1 and  <br>v2.  If you did then you would be giving him the same average velocity <br>as if he had done 1 minute at v1 and 1 minute at v2.  But how should we <br>attribute a reasonable weight to v2 ? Easy ! You divide the duration in <br>which the sprinter has a speed v2, which we shall call t2, by the total <br>time (t1+t2). Thus in this case t2/(t1+t2) is so small that the average <br>speed would resemble alot more the speed of the runner during the 2 <br>minutes. Of course if the sprinter started to run at near the speed of <br>light during that tenth of a second than it might not be so negligeable.<br> You would have to give the guy some credit for acheiving such a speed !<br> <br><br>So the correct average is v_avg=v1*t1/(t1+t2)+v2*t2/(t1+t2).

As a result, I think its fair to say just exactly how you&#39;re going to determine what the &quot;average&quot; velocity is, and I think using the derivative definition (instead of a secant line definition) is equally valid; but a different, mode of approaching the question. Additionally, it gives you a meaningful answer to the question. After all; if you were able to run around the track in an infinitesimally small amount of time, then you could just as easily say that you&#39;re running around the track 3, 4, or any number of &quot;times faster&quot; than the first lap.<br><br>I don&#39;t see any reason why the approach of averaging the value of derivatives at all points is not a valid and meaningful solution to the question; and I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;ve decided to suggest that its not a valid answer given the phrasing of your question since you didn&#39;t specify the precise definition of &quot;average velocity.&quot; After all; if two independent people ran around the track and you wanted to get the average velocity of both of those people then the sensible answer that most people would reach for would be to add the two velocities (derivative functions) together and divide by two.

The solution indispensably requires a discussion of the magnitude and direction of all the forces on the bike, as well as, the rotational motion/torque. <br><br>Now days, I have observed that &#39;Veritasium&#39; is going the &#39;DNews/Seeker&#39; way! Rarely offering an in-depth explanation! So, I am offering my explanation for the 4th riddle:-<br><br>Refer to the diagram shown at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72DCj3BztG4&amp;t=7m42s\">7:42</a>. Lets call the our force applied through string as F1. This is the force applied at the peddle. At first, it seems obvious that this is the only force acting on the bike, but its not so. Consider the torque around the centre point of the forward sprocket.  <br><br>We can safely say that this torque is F1*R1(Torque is the force applied multiplied by the perpendicular distance, of the point of application of that force, with the axis or point, around which torque is measured). <br><br>Now, this torque, is what, will generate the rotational motion around the centre of forward sprocket, and will cause it to move, thus generating a tension(say T) in the bike chain. <br><br>So, F1*R1 = T *R3   (because its the same torque) <br><br>Now, this force on the chain, which is tension T, will generate the rotational motion or torque around the centre of backward sprocket, causing it to move. When the sprocket tries to move, so does the back wheel/tyre of the bike, causing friction with the surface. This frictional force will be in the forward direction, as the bottom most part of the back wheel/tyre tries to go in the backward direction with respect to the ground. Lets call this frictional force, which acts at the bottom most part of the back wheel/tyre(point where the back wheel/tyre touches the ground surface) as Fr.<br><br>So, now, T*R4 = Fr * R2.<br><br>From the above two equations, we get:-<br><br>Fr = F1*R1*R4/(R2*R3)<br>which can also be written as:-<br>Fr = F1*(R1/R2)*(R4/R3)<br><br>So, now, we can clearly see that Fr &gt; F1 if R1/R2 &gt; R3/R4<br><br>Since, the tension T in the bike chain, cancels itself out, when finding out net forces on the bike, the only two forces on the bike are F1(ours) and Fr(Frictional force at the bottom most point of the back wheel, where it touches the ground). Our force is in the backward direction, and the frictional force is in the forward direction, with respect to the bike. <br><br>So, the bike moves backward when Fr &lt; F1, ie when R1/R2 &lt; R3/R4<br>and forward when Fr &gt; F1, ie when R1/R2 &gt; R3/R4", "comment_date": "2017-04-18T19:42:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Radu Murzea", "comment_text": "Btw the one with the 2 laps around the track makes absolutely no sense.

Also, you have used speed and velocity interchangeably. I came up with the same answer but bcaz I considered velocity and not speed. Velocity considers <b>direction</b> as well as speed! You said in the question video to cover the lap. Lap is an eclipse. So the average velocity would be zero! Why? Because you are moving in every direction at same speed so opposite directions cancel out. And hence V1 = 0.

However your average speed doesn&#39;t need to be related to time at all. Averages can be measured exclusively with respect to similar values, so if a car can go 100 ft in roughly 1 second (approximately 68 mph), and a person can go 33+1/3 ft/second (roughly Olympic speeds) then the average speed between these two would be exactly 66+2/3 ft/second because we&#39;re not relating the average to time anymore. We&#39;re looking at a single instant where their speeds were compared. This is just as valid a result in terms of statistics. We wouldn&#39;t ask someone measuring the average speed Olympic runners to figure out how long they spent running at slower speeds throughout their training. Using time here, we&#39;d need to include how many years they spent running at sub-Olympic levels and then incorporate that into our calculation but no one&#39;s going to do that. This would skew the data in favor of values that we&#39;re not interested in. Instead we ignore the data on these runners that lies outside the relative information we want to know. We want to compare the values to each other runner, not compare their values to the span of their lifetime. Again, because this got long, I have to reiterate that I agree with Veritasium too. If we&#39;re taking an average speed of a single runner through multiple iterations of a race, then yes, we&#39;ll never get to twice the value. But we aren&#39;t necessarily doing that. We can just as validly compare one racer&#39;s top speed to another racer&#39;s top speed by summing their values and dividing by two, it&#39;s just a different KIND of average, but one that still has value none the less.", "comment_date": "2017-04-18T15:19:25Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "qwergg", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t understand the bike riddle answer.
