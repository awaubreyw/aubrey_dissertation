I know it said that a counter-clockwise rotation is the same even in a mirror. However, its only the same with respect to the viewer of that mirror.

However, the ME in the mirror would ALSO see their clock face going opposite their locally known &quot;clockwise&quot;. In other words, if the mirror me flipped their mirror clock, that clock would be considered spinning &quot;clockwise&quot; but that direction would be opposite than my clockwise. Therefore, with regards to clockwise/anti-clockwise spin, our clockwise spin would be THEIR anti-clockwise spin and therefore a particle would discharge in a direction we would consider &quot;the same&quot; as ours does.

It had controlled &quot;ALL THERE&quot; via GRAVITISM.<br>        Over the last decades there have been remarkable developments in thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. Yet many of the basic problems have remained largely unsolved. In the spectrum of opinions expressed by authors who have attempted to solve these problems, one can roughly distinguish three main schools of thought:<br><br>1) Traditional\u00a0axiomatic\u00a0thermodynamics, which cannot explain the origin of irreversibility and time asymmetries.<br><br>2) The statistical school, which generates\u00a0\u201cman-made irreversibility\u2019\u2019\u00a0by imposing asymmetric conditions on symmetric ones in order to describe reality.<br><br>3)\u00a0The new gravitational school, which\u00a0deduces\u00a0the origin of evolution, irreversibility, electromagnetic and thermodynamics from Einsteinian gravitation and the verified expansion of the universe.<br>This school includes some new modifications to physics, as part of GRAVITISM.<br><br>My object is to obtain a consistent mathematical formulation of irreversibility in probabilistic theories. So far physicists have done this by means of (a priori) imposing on symmetric equations an (often hidden postulate of) asymmetry (which,\u00a0in itself, is equivalent to the very results that the mathematical analysis is aimed \u201cto prove\u201d).\u00a0In other words, the (asymmetric) \u201cresults\u201d (of classical and quantum-statistical physics) are not really results for they are deliberately enforced on, not deduced from symmetric formalism.<br><br>Such tactics are unacceptable, They lead to misleading philosophy of science, which, in turn, has generated a ludicrously incongruous mode of thinking in education and philosophy E.g. when, in 1915, Einstein discovered pre-existing Mercury mathematics-physics, it was not man-made, it was &quot;there&quot; at least since &quot;genesis&quot;.<br><br>Advocates of man-made irreversibility fall into the trap of assuming that which they set out to prove, and it was already &quot;There&quot;.

Does a photon transfer spatial curvature from one location to another? Wrap a piece of wire around a pencil and it can produce a 3D coil of wire, much like a spring. When viewed from the side it can look like a two-dimensional sine wave. You could coil the wire with either a right-hand twist, or with a left-hand twist. Could Planck&#39;s Constant be proportional to the twist cycles. A photon with a higher frequency has more energy. (More spatial curvature). What if gluons are actually made up of these twisted tubes which become entangled with other tubes to produce quarks. (In the same way twisted electrical extension cords can become entangled.) Therefore, the gluons are actually a part of the quarks. Mesons are made up of two entangled tubes (Quarks/Gluons), while protons and neutrons would be made up of three entangled tubes. (Quarks/Gluons) The &quot;Color Force&quot; would be related to the XYZ coordinates (orientation) of entanglement. &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot;, and &quot;flux tubes&quot; make sense based on this concept.  Neutrinos would be made up of a twisted torus (like a twisted donut) within this model.  Gravity is a result of a very small curvature imbalance within atoms. (This is why the force of gravity is so small.) Instead of attempting to explain matter as &quot;particles&quot;, this concept attempts to explain matter more in the manner of our current understanding of the space-time curvature of gravity.   If an electron has qualities of both a particle and a wave, it cannot be either one.  It must be something else.

The reason we cannot observe the negative direction of time is, i.e. when assumed it exists, because we cannot perceive it. Think about it like this: Imagine time as the X axis on the Cartesian plane. Our perception of time occurs when we &quot;observe&quot; all the changes that are happening in the universe at the same exact moments between two different points. As we are a part of the universe, considering that it is a closed environment, there is no way we can remove ourselves from it and look at it from the outside. Even if time moves backwards, let&#39;s say for five minutes so we moved five steps back on the X axis, the changes in our brains would revert to their states that they were in five minutes ago along with every single other change that happened in the universe. So, if we moved backwards along with every other thing around us, there would be no memories of the future or any other observable evidence that could be observed.

You would not have any particle interaction inside the box. No photon emitted from temperature, no movement of a particle inside, no information would get outside. You could not see a difference between two points in time, in fact two points in time would not exist. Everything inside the box would look exactly like it always looked and like it will look in the &quot;future&quot; that however doesn&#39;t exist. If you stored that box for lets say 100 years and maintain absolute zero inside, the particles in the box would look exactly the same after 100 years like they would look when you had opened it right away.<br>Thus time is an effect of interaction that always happens. You can not cool a part of the universe to absolute zero and thus time doesn&#39;t stop anywhere in the universe. Now why does it always move in one direction? Because not every interaction between particles is reverseable. If a particle exist in quantum superposition and then interacts with something (read: you measure it), the particle&#39;s properties crystalize from the probabilities of all properties the particle had.

For the same of this thought experiment, we&#39;ll say we&#39;ve been working at it for a while and have managed to share enough about ourselves that we can communicate with language.<br><br><br>We have for instance discovered that they are on a planet that also has gravity and so they can understand what we mean by up and down. Their planet also has magnetic poles so we can communicate north and south. Their planet also spins so we can communicate traveling in the same direction as the spin or the reverse direction of the spin, and that we call that going east and west.

If they are on a planet that spins in the reverse direction of us, our descriptions of our planet would still make sense, but they would, unfortunately, mirror everything. If they drew a picture of what they thought a human looked like based on our description of ourselves, they might equally likely draw the heart on the right or the left side of the drawing.

The processes in our brains that lead to consciousness would do exactly the same, they would reverse, speed up, or slow down, as they are embedded in time.

Einstein taught us that time would actually slow down for the crew on board (though everything would seem normal to them), as well as for their clocks and other instruments.

In other words, it\u2019s a sound vibration that is the essence of all of existence and non-existence, the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source.  Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the true creator of everything that is, ever was and ever will be, right down to the minutest particles of dust, each being an individual ripple or wave. The big difference between chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a \u2018middleman\u2019 to connect us to our state of enlightenment, we\u2019re able to do it ourselves by tapping directly into it by way of self-produced sound vibration.\r<br>\r<br>  On the subject of \u2018Who or What Is God?\u2019, when we compare the concept of \u2018God\u2019, as a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to Nichiren\u2019s teachings, the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people call \u2018God\u2019 is our enlightenment, which exists nowhere else but within us.\r<br>\r<br>   When the disciples asked Jesus where the Kingdom of God is, didn\u2019t he tell them that it was within them?\r<br>\r<br>   Some say that \u2018God\u2019 is an entity that can never be seen. I think that the vast amount of information that is constantly being conveyed via electromagnetic waves gives us proof of how an invisible state of \u2018God\u2019 could actually exist. It\u2019s widely known that certain data being relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects, including instant global awareness of something or mass emotional reaction. As well as many other things, it\u2019s also common knowledge that these waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to even enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars. However, none of this is possible without a receiver to decode the information that is being transmitted. Without the receiver, the information would remain impotent.\r<br>\r<br>   In a very similar way, it\u2019s important for us to have our \u2018receiver\u2019 switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our life, all other life and what we and all else that exists truly is. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach into the core of our enlightenment and switch it on. That\u2019s because the sound vibration of myoho-renge-kyo represents the combination of the three major laws that underlie all existence.\r<br>\r<br>   Myoho represents the Law of latency and manifestation (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. One state of myo is where everything in life that\u2019s not obvious to us exists. This includes our stored memories when we\u2019re not thinking about them, our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they\u2019re not being expressed, our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma, and more importantly, our enlightenment. The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes obvious to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory, whenever we experience or express our emotions, or whenever a good or bad effect manifests from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it simply means that it has come out of the state of \u2018myo\u2019 (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It\u2019s simply the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing something. \r<br>\r<br>  The second law, renge, governs and controls the functions of myoho, ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect. The two laws of myoho and renge, both functions together simultaneously, as well as underlies all spiritual and physical existence.\r<br>\r<br>   The final and third part of the tri-combination, kyo, is what allows the law myoho to be able to integrate with the law renge. It\u2019s the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects together all Life and matter, as well as the past, present and future. It is often termed the Universal Law of Communication. Perhaps it could even be compared to the string theory that some scientists now suspect exists.\r<br>\r<br>   Just as our body cells, thoughts, feelings and all else are constantly fluctuating within us, everything in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux, in accordance with these three laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of myo and ho in a single moment than it would ever be possible for us to calculate or describe. And it doesn&#39;t matter how big or small, important or trivial that anything may appear to be, everything that\u2019s ever existed in the past exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of myoho-renge-kyo.\r<br>\r<br>  These three laws are also the basis of the four fundamental forces and if they didn&#39;t function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. Simply put, all forms of existence, including the seasons, day and night, birth, death and so on, are all moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation, rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two universal states of myo and ho in absolute accordance with renge and by way of kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn in accordance with the workings of what the combination myoho-renge-kyo represents.\r<br>\r<br>   Nam, or Namu, on the other hand, is a password or a key; it allows us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with myoho-renge-kyo. On a more personal basis, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it\u2019s the causes that we\u2019ve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives from moment to moment, as well in our environment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is turning, and rhythmically chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo for a minimum of ten minutes daily, anyone can experience actual proof of its positive effects in their life.\r<br>\r<br>  In so doing, we can pierce through even the thickest layers of our karma and activate our Buddha Nature (the enlightened state). We\u2019re then able to summon forth the wisdom needed to challenge, overcome and change our negative circumstances into positive ones. It brings forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that is preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we truly are, regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexual preference. We are also able to see and understand our circumstances and an environment more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations.\r<br>\r<br>  Actual proof soon becomes apparent to anyone who chants the words Nam-myoho-renge-kyo on a regular daily basis. Everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect, so the strength of the result from chanting depends on dedication, sincerity and determination. To explain it more simply, the difference could be compared to making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, or producing a song and so on.\r<br>\r<br>NB: There are frightening, disturbing sounds and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It&#39;s the emotional result from any sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day you are producing a sound vibration that is the password to your true inner-self - this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things, such as your fears and desires etc. The important way to get the best result when chanting is not to see things in a conventional way (difficult to achieve but can be done), rather than reaching out to an external source, you need to reach into your own life and bring your needs and desires to fruition from within, including any help that you may need. Think of it as a seed within you that you are bringing sunshine and water to in order for it to grow, blossom and bring forth fruit or flowers. It\u2019s important to understand that everything that we need in life, all the answers and potential to achieve our dreams, already exist within us.\r<br>\r<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZ0XJqWRr4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZ0XJqWRr4</a>         OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN   sings about Nam-myoho-renge-kyo", "comment_date": "2019-07-09T01:20:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "harrymoschops", "comment_text": "The work of Louis Pasteur on left and right handedness in crystals, specifically the preference of yeast to consume tartaric acid over racemic acid, and the general asymmetry of molecules produced by living organisms, may provide a deeper insight into why the &#39;Universe cares&#39; about chirality.

I really never get why order is assumed, instead of chaos. When it comes to physics, this is already widely known from many experiments done in zero gravity. I would also say increasing entropy is not <b>actually</b> where it all stops when it comes to the concept of actual &#39;time&#39; itself though. Most likely, the end result will not be anything stable, as hardly anything in nature ever really is. I would even go as far as to say the assumption of entropy in physical sciences implying a single direction of progress, is most likely just plain false. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yArprk0q9eE&amp;t=7m22s\">7:22</a> ; the image here doesn&#39;t show a unique relation to time at all. It merely shows the exact same thing, but in reverse. The reason &#39;we have no idea&#39; when it comes to your concluding words has everything to do with how time as a practical concept is a rather difficult thing to truly grasp, let alone  study.\u00a0We don&#39;t know if it is truly linear, we don&#39;t know if it is multidimensional or multidirectional. <br>I don&#39;t think a particle&#39;s location within spacetime at a given absolute moment in time will truly give away  any clues on how the actual tendency of time itself works. In an unironic way, we&#39;d need an actual time machine before we could truly answer some of those questions. With the uncertainty principle in mind, it also remains questionable whether direction, location are even decent indicators of really anything more absolute anyway in relation to time. For example, let&#39;s assume that the events in life as we know it are recorded on a VHS tape. What if those events in time are recorded in such ways within the grand scheme of cause and effects in our universe that there&#39;s is no true way of changing the events (even if we COULD rewind time. And yes, on a small scale one might assume you should be able to change things, however this really only ever applies to very short term events, single decisions on a very small scope/range). Now just imagine every couple of seconds, time itself would actually rewind a bit, only to continue in whatever direction it had. This merely means that the events that had already happened, are reversed in order, only to happen again with the exact same results as before. In other words, no one would ever notice the short change in direction of time. And I&#39;m guessing THAT&#39;s why we actually see the implicated &#39;arrow of time&#39; through entropy. From a perspective of logic, there&#39;s really no reason why we couldn&#39;t reverse the direction of time.

However from the left right inversion, our mirror counterpart would be observing the particle to be spinning counterclockwise.  Now take into account the left right parity if the real brain. The q at the left of the key board is on the same side as my left hand and my left brain. In the world of the mirror observer q would be on the right side paired with their right hand and their right brain. My left brain is its right brain and follows the same inputs. So, my right brain and its left brain should also follow the same principles. Since the world of the mirror person is a left right inversion of my perceived world, then all mappings of mirror world to mirror person should be perceived jjust as the real world is perceived by me. The mirror person would actually be seeing the particle rotate clockwise and the clockwise a real person sees rotating on the mirror is actually a counterclockwise rotation akin to looking at the rotating object moving toward the mirror rather than away from the observer.

The CPT transformation turns our universe into its &quot;mirror image&quot; and vice versa. CPT symmetry is recognized to be a fundamental property of physical laws.<br><br>In order to preserve this symmetry, every violation of the combined symmetry of two of its components (such as CP) must have a corresponding violation in the third component (such as T); in fact, mathematically, these are the same thing. Thus <b>violations in T symmetry are often referred to as CP violations.</b> &quot;<br><br>So, according to this, mathematically speaking, CP violations are THE SAME THING as T violations. That part always tripped me out when I thought I began understanding this stuff decently, lol. Often times you hear people talk about CP violations like they are a different thing from T-symmetry or T-violations. Apparently, mathematically speaking, they are the same thing though... so if CP is the same thing as T from that mathematical perspective, then WTF is &quot;CPT&quot;? CP <b>by itself</b> would already be the full &quot;CPT&quot; since CP violations are the same as T violations, no? That&#39;s the part that confuses me. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;correct&quot; this video or anything; I&#39;m just trying to ask an honest question and hopefully have someone clarify for me how CP doesn&#39;t already cover the full &quot;CPT&quot; by itself if CP violations are mathematically the same exact thing as T violations already... <br><br>(And yes, I know CPT = Charge, Parity, Time. That&#39;s not the answer I&#39;m looking for though, if you actually read my post... I&#39;m trying to see how/why we need to categorize it as &quot;CPT&quot; if CP violations/symmetry already mathematically represent T violations/symmetry... That&#39;s the weirdness I&#39;m not getting fully. It would just seem like &quot;CP&quot; already is &quot;CPT&quot; in a way by itself, from them calling CP and T mathematically &quot;the same thing.&quot; *I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing*, so I would appreciate a real answer, if anyone out there is listening and not just put off by &quot;Oh my god, he wrote too much!

Gravity is the consequence of the curvature of space-time.  It may be possible that the structure of space-time itself could be warped without the presence of mass.  Space-time has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independent of mass. These properties have been proven with observations of gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves. Fabrics can be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of deformation. Such extreme conditions were all present during inflation, so it is plausible that space-time\u2019s elastic nature could have hit its yield point and permanently deformed. Therefore, if gravity is the consequence of the warping of space-time, and fabrics can be permanently deformed, then a deformation could create a gravitational effect independent of mass.  DM could be a microscopic black holes with no mass at the center, so they wouldn&#39;t lose their strength via Hawking Radiation.<br><br>Prediction: Spacetime&#39;s elastic property hits a yield point, so only that part of geodesic&#39;s &quot;stretch marks&quot; would remain after inflation stopped.

It&#39;s not that time travel is impossible. It&#39;s just moving forward in time takes less energy than moving backward in time. And the more you move backward in time the more energy is needed. And the amount of energy just to move time forward is huge. So picture needing 2x the energy. Say it takes about 2 years worth of stored energy to send say an apple 1 second forward in time from the present to the future it could take. All the power generation of the USA stored up for 2 year just to move it an extra second forward besides the enegy applied by the universe to run all it&#39;s interactions for that orange 1 second. So to move it backwards or even pause it in time you would need 4 years of energy stored up. Because time is nothing more than the speed of interactions of particles and force carriers in a system. The more particles interacting the more lag you get due to a bottleneck thanks to the speed of light so the universe does not lag out to the point it collapses so time is stretched out to handle the extra interactions correctly with as little error as possible. And why a black hole lags the universe to the point that time in that local pocket of space-time is slowed down. And the less particles that interact the faster time goes. Think of it as opening chrome. 1 browser window and everything runs smooth and nice. But you open 36 of them and time is going to run slower in that pocket of space-time of the computer. So thanks to lag for the effect we perceive as time so I can always get time with my kids.

Promethium has the lowest followed by krypton and stroncesium where the beta decay had different what I called punching power. Promethium would be cut off at 110 gsm krypton ( its been a few years please bear with me) was around 350 gsm and str. was about 1000 gsm. The electron must travel at close to speed of light in all cases. Shouldn&#39;t they all have the same momentum? The electron mass stays the same. Velocity should be the same cause its the same process. Note adding more source material does NOT impact punching power it affects signal to noise.  More noise makes  filtering easier when using fast sampling. Typ 1000/dec.

Time is not so mysterious to me as is seems to you and most others I reckon.<br><br>The only logical (or perhaps most fundamental) explanation to any property of reality or physics that I can deduce, always relies on entropy. The universe we know in 3D is just a single macrostate. In 4D there are just a lot of microstates (infinite ones) and together form the multiverse. In this multiverse, there are a lot of similar microstates that are indistinguishable to &#39;us&#39;*, which make up a single macrostate. <br><br>This is where the concept of time comes in: Time is just a sequential order of macrostates in which the nearer the macrostate to another macrostate is, the more identical microstates it contains. The fewer identical microstates it contains, the farther away the events are separated.<br>This is analogous to time as you know it, because it takes more time (or/and energy) to change a lot than to change a little.<br><br>Memory is a function of the brain that is the only thing that gives us an idea of the existence of different macrostates.

This means the axis of rotation, although in the same clockwise direction in both worlds, would still have an added negative sign in one of the worlds. This would mean that although the beta particles are travelling in opposite direction, they are both still travelling in the &quot;correct&quot; direction w.r.t the Right-hand or Left-hand rules of each universe.

So as we choose what the future holds time moves behind us. Right? So then this video makes sense. Because time is moving backwards just in the opposite direction and present is the mirror and future is the common notion of &quot;time moving in one direction&quot;. The past effects the future and the future effects our perception of the past. So basically past in the equation is actually the &quot;real world&quot; while the future is just the reflection of the past. Maybe the scientists are just looking at it in the wrong direction. Think about it...we focus more on the past because it helps us determine how to better forge a future so the future is almost surely determined by the past making them equal but opposite. Therefore time is also not asymmetrical. Just rewatched the video to get clarification and he states that time isn&#39;t symmetrical and the thing they needed to make asymmetrical was the CPT but I spent a lot of time writing this and thinking about it so its here if anyone wants to read my train of thought comment.

In our universe, time only has one direction - forward.  Meanwhile, we can observe opposites of parity and charge.  How do we even know there is symmetry to time?<br>2.  Time is relative, but parity and a charge are absolute.  In another perspective, parity and charge are either -1 or 1; there is no in-between.  But time can be any positive number (where 0 is frozen time, 1 is &quot;normal time&quot;, and anything beyond 1 is moving faster).  That being said, it seems a little bit like comparing apples to oranges.<br>3.  If time can only go forward, how could you mirror/reverse time without reversing <i>all</i> of time?  In other words, even if we successfully reverse time, we would be reversed along with it and therefore be unable to measure it.  If time can be reversed in a centralized location, I imagine this would cause major complications.  Remember, space and time are linked, so if you&#39;re reversing time, you&#39;re reversing the space that the test subject is in too.  Seeing as we&#39;re constantly moving through our solar system, galaxy, and the universe, I imagine that anything that experiences time reversal will effectively teleport, and therefore be unable to be tested.<br>4.  Assuming none of the above scenarios are a problem, how does one prove that something is experienced mirrored time, and isn&#39;t just simply moving or spinning in another direction?

Wrong! First of all spin is not a actual rotation, it is just misfortune it is named that way. But most importantly your demonstration directly suggest that the direction of spin is not independent from charge, and this is perfectly evidenced by the fact that you can align the spin with a magnet (moving electrons). The magnet actually provides the answer, the relation of spin and the emission is similar to the magnetism and electricity. Just substitute &quot;spin&quot; by &quot;magnetic arc&quot; around a wire, and it become immediately obvious why it is nonsense to expect the electrons on the wire to be equally likely to be flowing in any direction.<br>We don&#39;t need to address CP because it was never shown what experiment was talked about.

Think about this; when a cobalt 60 nucleus is spinning, what is the factor that creates the increased likelihood of the electron being emitted in one direction? If a nucleus has no default or preferred orientation in space, why would a spin cause a preferential direction of electron emission? We know that, on a large scale, a spinning object will affect the curve of space around that object. An object which orbits another object, is really just going straight through space which is curved by mass. If you look at the situation from that reference point, you realize that the very existence of a spinning object must be a result of a spatial distortion either caused by the &quot;shape&quot; of space, or it was acted upon by another force according to the first law of motion. My idea is that the inherent shape of space cannot allow for an object to stay at rest, and that the idea that an object at rest will stay at rest, is an assumption under the (second) assumption that space is perfectly flat and completely unbent. Motion, as well as gravity, is just an illusion, a result of the bending of space. So why does every single electron have some sort of spin? Because there is only one true electron which is separated into all electrons through a similar principle to holograms. And how was that original electron put into motion if there was only a single electron to begin with? It must be that space is &quot;leaning&quot; in, but for space to lean in a direction in the third dimension will not cause a spin. If all particle spin can be attributed to this illusion, and particles appear to be spinning straight in the 3rd dimension, but they&#39;re on an angle in the 4th dimension or higher, that would account for the increased likelihood of a spinning nucleus causing an increased probability of an electron being ejected in a certain direction according to spin.<br><br>If the only reason things appear the way they do in our dimension is due to a default &quot;alignment&quot; in a higher dimension, then it&#39;s possible the direction of the electron emissions are affected by said higher dimension, and the electrons are trying to be emitted in the opposite direction, but the dimensional orientation of the higher-dimensional representation of the cobalt 60 atom just sends it in a direction which doesn&#39;t technically exist, therefore the electron does not get emitted.", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T16:06:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unsung Gamer", "comment_text": "I almost never fully understand your videos, but god dammit do I love watching them.", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T16:05:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheAmmoniacal", "comment_text": "Jorge Cham?

How do we measure the passage of time? We measure it by measuring interactions that are driven by increasing entropy. If entropy wasnt increasing no interactions would happen and &quot;time&quot; as we know it would not exist. Time exist because entropy is increasing, before the big bang when the universe was homogeneous, Time did not exist, and at the end of the universe, when heat death occurs, the universe will be homogeneous once again, and time will cease to exist<br><br>Also in your description of how the weak force symmetry was violated...it is unclear to me how this was proven. All the researcher proved was that the beta particles were emitted preferentially to the side oppose the spin, not that it is emitted based on some universal axis. Why would the particle care about a universal definition of axis, it cares about the local axis of that particle, ie the direction of spin. in a mirror world, mirrored to our own we cant do any experiments, we arnt there. how is the researcher certain that the beta particles will be emitted with the direction of spin rather than against it. Her result is based on the ASSUMPTION that it would be emitted equally on both sides, and that if it WASNT EQUAL then symmetry is violated... and that is the problem.. i prefer writing with my right hang rather then my left, no one says that im proof symmetry is violated because i prefer 1 side over the other.  Her assumption that it would be equal has biased the results, she set out to prove that symmetry was violated and then set up her hypothesise and assumptions such that there was 1 way to prove symmetry and every other way to disprove it. <br><br>If i say that the moon is not made from cheese, then there is only 1 way that im am wrong... if its is made from cheese.....but there are innumerable ways that i would be proven right, it being made from literally ANYTHING else.
