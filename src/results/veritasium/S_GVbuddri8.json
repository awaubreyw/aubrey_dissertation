Basically, you should have an elongation of the star with a noticeable trail. I don&#39;t see any such effect in the image that justifies there is a black hole in the middle, even in case there were more stars close to the black hole. Either that, or the model that defines the black hole is wrong.

Despite shysters like \u201ccosmologist\u201d, particle and quantum \u201cphysicist\u201d the future is here. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GFFfmBGb5U\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GFFfmBGb5U</a> Hydrogen and distillation of water will be dirt cheap to produce; hydrogen powered cars and trucks not electric will be the future. This new fusion reactor could be used to power ships possibly trains as well. We will not need their gas, oil, fission, solar, wind or water power any more. This is what real scientist not shysters have discovered: <a href=\"https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/%C2%A0\">https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/\u00a0</a>. \u201cCosmologies,\u201d particle and quantum \u201cphysicist\u201d could not even figure out how the Sun works, why would you believe anything they have to say? When you go to one of these shyster channels and they talk about history of science they never talk about the discoveries of plasma scientist not even a Nobel prize-winning one and his warning to \u201cCosmology\u201d, the many discrepancies in Einstein&#39;s theories (whoops there just went all of cosmetology), the electric universe theory and how a startling number of their predictions have come true, how there is a very rational and mathematical explanation for the double split beam experiment (whoops there just went half of quantum mechanics) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc</a> [what really must chaff them this guy is a computer programmer: LOL] \u00a0and the big bang (actually a derogatory term for the speculation) is fact. Some go as far as to close public comment in an effort to keep this information from the public. NASA did not, possibly still not even put current detecting probes on their satellites. This goes to show how biased and unscientific these supposed researchers are. \u201cEverything is just too complicated for the average mind to grasp; just trust us, keep sending us government grant money and filling our college classrooms with tuition-paying students.\u201d Those who do not learn from history are bound to repeat it. As impressive as this technology is most likely it is too little to late to stop global warming. If shysters were not allowed to stall science for over 35 years and have us spend billions on their shyster projects, global warming would not be an issue today.", "comment_date": "2020-12-25T18:51:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nicklas Rasmussen", "comment_text": "Is it possible to create an object with a mass great enough to have a visible gravitational pull?", "comment_date": "2020-12-25T14:32:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cantsaycoco", "comment_text": "If Hawking could have only seen this", "comment_date": "2020-12-25T13:47:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bradley Knight", "comment_text": "Intresting", "comment_date": "2020-12-25T06:49:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florianooke", "comment_text": "this says different, <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2019/4/19/how-scientists-captured-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole/\">https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2019/4/19/how-scientists-captured-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole/</a> and it comes from NASA....

So where did Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, with this medical information ??<br><br>4 - God said: (And the heavens we built with hands, but we are enlarged) Aldhariyat: 47<br><br>And modern science has proven that the sky is constantly expanding, so who told Muhammad, may God\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, of this fact in these backward ages? Did he own telescopes and satellites? !! Or is it a revelation from God, the creator of this great universe ??? Is not this conclusive evidence that this Qur\u2019an is a right from God ???<br><br>5- God said (And the sun runs to settle for her. That is the appreciation of the dear, the most knowledgeable) Yes: 38<br><br>And modern science has proven that the sun is traveling at 43200 miles an hour, and since the distance between us and the sun is 92 million miles, we see it as a constant that does not move. These are scientific facts that we were not able to learn from until recently.<br><br>6 - God said (He who wants to lead him astray makes his chest narrow and critical, as if he ascends in the sky) Al-Anam: 125<br><br>Now when you get on a plane and fly you and go up in the sky, how do you feel? Don&#39;t you feel chest tightness? In your opinion, who told Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, 1400 years ago? Did he own his own spacecraft, through which he could know this physical phenomenon? Or is it a revelation from God Almighty ???<br><br>7 - God said (And what night do we have the day from which we should flush from the day, so when they are wronged) Yes: 37<br>And God said (And we have decorated the earthly heaven with favors): King: 5<br>As the two generous verses indicate, the universe is drowned in dark darkness, even though we are in broad daylight on the surface of the earth. Scientists have seen the earth and the rest of the planets of the solar system illuminated in broad daylight while the heavens around them are sunk in the dark. Darkness is the dominant state of the universe? And that these galaxies and stars are nothing but small and weak lamps that do not nearly dispel the darkness of the surrounding universe, and it looked like decorations and lamps, no more?<br><br>8 - God said (And we made the sky a preserved roof) the Prophets: 32<br><br>And modern science has proven the presence of the atmosphere surrounding the Earth, which protects it from harmful solar radiation and destroyed meteorites. They quickly extinguish and disappear, and this is what we call the meteors. Who told Muhammad, may God\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, that the sky, like the roof, keeps the Earth from meteorites and harmful solar radiation? Is this not from the definitive evidence that this Qur\u2019an is from the creator of this great universe ???<br><br>9 - God said: (And the mountains as pegs). News: 7<br>And God said: (And put my mind on the ground to stretch out with you) Luqman: 10<br><br>Since the Earth&#39;s crust and the mountains, plateaus and deserts on it rise above the liquid depths and the moving mollusk known as the (cinema layer), the earth&#39;s crust and its on it will expand and move constantly and will result in massive movement and earthquakes that destroy everything .. But nothing of this happened ... Reason ?<br><br>It has been evident recently that two-thirds of any mountain is planted deep in the ground and in the (Sima caste) and only a third is raised above the surface of the earth, so God Almighty likened the mountains to the pegs that hold the tent to the earth as in the previous verse.<br><br>10- God said (And you see the mountains counting them as rigid, and they pass by the clouds, God made them who mastered everything) Ants: 88<br><br>We all know that the mountains are fixed in their place, but if we rise from the earth away from its attractiveness and atmosphere, then we will see the earth rotating at a tremendous speed (100 miles per hour), and then we will see the mountains as if they are walking the clouds, that is, their movement is not subjective, but is related to the movement of the earth just like the clouds that do not move Himself is driven by wind, and this is evidence of the movement of the earth.

The Coriolis effect is when stood on the equator water flows stright down, no rotations, this is due to the pole magnetics equalizing and the earth is a ball shape, the hole is not a ball shape and has no north and south pole or magnetics, thus no rotations of whirls of matter.

Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. A dying massive star will eventually turn into a black hole where atoms will be crashed to quarks before reducing further to preons, elementary particles when it is collapsed under its own massive weights. Precisely, negative preons are surrounded with positive preons and vice versa to form a very dense sturdy structure that we coined as superstructure. Therefore a black hole is so dense that even light can&#39;t escape from it. A black hole is spiraling at neck-breaking rate that cause approaching celestial bodies towards the black hole to form an accretion disk under the spinning-gravitational effect of the spiraling black hole. Two jets of photons and debris ejecting from the superstructure perpendicular on both sides of the accretion\u00a0disk\u00a0to excrete out excess photons from the superstructure because they\u00a0can&#39;t be used to construct the extension of the superstructure. \u00a0The black hole is not sitting on the gravitational wave! Gravitational wave doesn&#39;t exist. Where on earth that it is sitting on the gravitational wave that is inaccessible to anyone? None! It is time to wake up and wise up.

Then simply review the light spectrum data taken of the gas and dust surrounding the black hole Sgr A* in the center of our galaxy.

They assume that matter can accelerate and compress until it is \u201cspaghettified\u201d, or stretched, whereupon it is torn apart and reconfigured by intense gravity fields.<br><br>Almost all (more than 95%) of galaxies are thought by astronomers to be home to one or more black holes. Since matter spins around a black hole at extreme velocities, consensus opinions state that it heats up from friction, generating X-rays and ultraviolet light. It is those emissions that are interpreted as indirect evidence for black holes.<br><br>Previous Pictures of the Day take issue with that model. The terminology, itself, is highly speculative and ambiguous. To say that X-rays and ultraviolet light are created in gravity fields is to betray an ignorance. Experiments in the laboratory create those energies by accelerating charged particles in an electric field.<br><br>There is no experiment that can provide evidence for matter collapsed to \u201cnear infinite density\u201d. Rather, Bennet pinches (z-pinches) in plasma-state material form plasmoids. When the electric flux inside double layers within galactic circuits gets too high, there is a sudden \u201cshort circuit\u201d that draws energy from the surrounding space. That energy could be concentrated from hundreds of cubic light years and then discharged in a burst of cosmic lightning, generating X-rays or flares of ultraviolet light.<br><br>Instead of a black hole, X-ray radiation from a plasmoid in the Milky Way\u2019s heart is a charged particle accelerator, so electrons spiral in the electromagnetic fields and give off X-rays. The diffuse currents then flow out of the poles and back toward the galaxy\u2019s equatorial plane, spiraling back toward the core.<br><br>There is no evidence that matter can collapse to \u201cnear infinite density\u201d under gravity\u2019s influence. Black holes are phantoms that can never be observed, since their so-called \u201cevent horizons\u201d are impenetrable, allowing no direct observations. No light can escape, so they are invisible at any wavelength. They are pure theory, and have no basis for existence in the natural world.<br><br>Black holes are the subject of many previous Picture of the Day articles. The short story, from an Electric Universe perspective, is that black holes are a misperception. The descriptive terminology used by researchers is problematic, relying on loose interpretations. Ambiguous lexical labels such as space/time, singularities, infinite density, and other non-quantifiable ideas, make what should be realistic investigations into a kind of irony.<br><br>Using the concept of infinity is all over the work on black holes: infinitely weak gravity is compared to infinitely dense black holes. Such ideas mask the fact that no scientist understands gravity, or how mass is expressed by matter, or how matter expresses gravity. They especially ignore the Electric Universe.<br><br>Since stars are plasma phenomena, they are governed by electricity and not by gravity, alone. Since stars are loads in an externally powered circuit, a drop in circuit power means a drop in output, so a star will disappear\u2014it enters a dark mode state. Variations in electric power mean variations in how a star behaves.<br><br>Astronomers believe gravity is their only tool, and, in their world, no force can stop the collapse of any mass great enough to form a black hole. However, gravity\u2019s effect is so small that it is effectively non-existent when compared to the electric force. It is charge separation that holds stars together, preventing their collapse. Even thermonuclear fires are not needed for a star to \u201clive\u201d.

More gas keeps getting pushed together. But because theres nothing and everything beyond space, a star cannot exist nor will it exist. So all that it is is just large amounts of gravity getting stronger, everytime something gets close, it pulls and shreds and makes more gas and more gravity. No they are made of stars so they already have large amounts of gas but the black hole is able to bend time and space itself, meaning anything in it is gone and still there. But they are also invisible. You can think of a black hole as the incognito succ or something. If anything enters a black hole in my theory, is they see all but nothing, time and space, and if you can see the shade or color or even what invisible, could look like, youve entered a state of mind of insanity.

There is no immediate profit to be made from the discovery. In fact, it could not have happened if these scientists had to justify their research on the basis of future commodities to be sold on the market, if they were beholden to private investors and quarterly earnings reports. It required social and public funding to liberate science from the boundaries/fetters of profit. Or it would not have happened. Nor could it have happened without profound international coordination (including with Russians and Chinese scientists!) <br><br>You see what I&#39;m getting at.<br><br>While we can take pictures of previously unseeable things, 55 million light years away, global capitalism can&#39;t figure out how to get all the abundance of food into the world&#39;s hungry bellies, all the homeless into the empty homes, and how to guarantee the conditions of existence as social rights. Because there&#39;s no profit to be made there -- quite the contrary. Our economies are bound by the profit motive and the systems of production, distribution, research and technology are controlled by corporations. So these massive social problems are widely considered natural, permanent, unsolvable. The UN declared them as Millennial Development Goals to be reached by 2015. All the countries signed up; they had celebrations and press conferences. But they failed to reach them. The people remained hungry. The rich got richer. All because of the boundaries of the profit system.<br><br>Albert Einstein, whose theory of general relativity led to the theory of black holes -- as the only way to resolve otherwise unresolvable physics problems \u2014 was also a socialist. He saw then, a full century ago, that there was more than enough for humanity to provide for the needs of the people if the economy were simply reorganized. A century later the black hole theory has entered into the world of reality, while his plain observation that we can have a world without hunger, homelessness and poverty remains &quot;theoretical.&quot; <br><br>That theory too can be made real. The scientists who made this breakthrough did so because they devoted their lives to it; it was not a passing interest that they focused on here and there. It will take a lot of dedication, hard work, trial, error and sacrifice to make our next, great collective &quot;breakthrough for humanity.&quot; No one needs an advanced degree to join.

When this happens gravity wins and then crushes the star into a singularity. The question is: where is this strong gravitational force coming from? I always wondered that. If gravity is that strong why doesn\u2019t it crush the Earth? Why does it only crush stars if anything with mass warps space time. Why aren\u2019t the gas giants crushed?

By that i mean, the mechanism of galaxies in the universe seem to resemble or mirror an inner mechanism inside ourselves pertaining specifically to our inner world of desires and attachments. I realize that by identifying ourselves with ANY particular idea, desire or interest, the mind seems to enter, in a sort of, endless swirling &quot;horizontally-contracted&quot; movement of thought activity, giving rise to the sense of time and space in us, as &quot;we&quot; try to fulfill this specific desire or interest. As long as we keep entertaining and pursuing this particular desire, induced by our fear of letting go, this swirling motion inside of us will keep going on and on in circles, aka engagement and identification in constant thinking. Only when the maturity is there to willingly let go of that interest or &quot;desire to fulfill&quot; whatever it may be, this particular swirling thought activity inside the mind seem to start receding or sinking in its own source, while at the same time a physical release of energy is felt to be flowing vertically across the physical body as the detachment of the attachment is taking place, opening us back to our natural, open and relaxed self as we truly release this need, stilling the mind along the way. I notice that galaxies in the universe seem to follow this similar behavior. The horizontal disk accretion of a galaxy constricted by its surrounded dark matter, seem to resemble this endless swirling &quot;horizontally-contracted&quot; movement of thought activity in the mind as we &quot;desire to know or be&quot; something other that what we already are. Also, the painful letting go process of the attachment inside ourselves, seem to resemble the gobbling of the surrounding matter, by the black hole, in the center of its own galaxy, while vertical jets of x-ray energy are being emitted by it in the process. Hopefully we can test this theory some day, scientifically, by performing a brain scan of a volunteer, as we ask for him to willingly and SINCERELY let go of a particular strong desire in him, which of course, is not an easy feat to accomplish, since &quot;fear of losing&quot; this particular attachment is involved in this endeavor, in order for us to see and monitor whether his brain emits x-rays in this process, the same way as a gobbling black hole would do. As we are looking outside ourselves, we are looking inside ourselves.

(9) And that those who believe not in the Hereafter, for them We (God) have prepared a painful torment (Hell). (10) And man invokes (God/All\u00e2h/Yahweh) for evil as he invokes (Him) for good . And man is ever hasty [i.e., for example if he is angry with his son , he invokes (saying): &quot;That God curses you&quot; ] (11) And We have appointed the night and the day as two signs. Then, We have obliterated the sign of the night while We have made the sign of the day illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning. And We have explained everything (in detail) with full explanation. (12) And We have fastened every man&#39;s deeds to his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection, We shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide open. (13) (It will be said to him): &quot;Read your book. You yourself are sufficient as a reckoner against you this Day.&quot; (14) Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his ownself. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another&#39;s burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning). (15) And when We decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey All\u00e2h/God/Yahweh and be righteous) to those among them who lead a life of luxury. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction (16) And how many generations have We destroyed after Noah! And Sufficient is your Lord as an All-Knower and All-Beholder of the sins of His servants. (17) Whoever desires the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected,\u00a0 (18) And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it (i.e. righteous deeds ) while he is a believer , then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated, (thanked and rewarded by All\u00e2h/God/Yahweh). (19) On - each these as well as those - We bestow from the Bounties of your Lord. And the Bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden. (20) See how We prefer one above another (in this world) and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preference (21) Set not up with All\u00e2h/Yahweh/God any other god, (O man)! , or you will sit down reproved, forsaken (in the Hell-fire). (22) And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. (23) And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: &quot;My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.&quot; (24) Your Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is Ever Most Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance. (25) And give to the kinsman his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift . (26) Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the devils , and the Devil (Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord. (27) And if you turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarer, whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft, kind word . (28) And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty. (29) Truly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves. (30) And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin. (31) And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is an immoral sin, and an evil way . (32) And do not kill anyone whose killing All\u00e2h/God has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed wrongfully , We have given his heir the authority [(to demand Law of Equality in punishment\u2014 or to forgive, or to take blood - money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e he should not kill except the killer). Verily, he is helped (by the divine law) (33) And come not near to the orphan&#39;s property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! the covenant, will be questioned about. (34) And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end. (35) And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by All\u00e2h/Yahweh). (36) And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height. (37) All the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord. (38) This is (part) of wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you (O Muhammad ). And set not up with All\u00e2h/God/yahweh any other god lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected, (from God&#39;s Mercy). (39)<br>Has then your Lord (O pagans) preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself from among the angels daughters? Verily! You indeed utter an awful saying. (40)\u00a0And surely, We have explained [Our Promises, Warnings and (set forth many) examples] in this Qur&#39;\u00e2n that they (the disbelievers) may take heed, but it increases them in naught save aversion. (41)\u00a0Say (O Muhammad\u00a0 to\u00a0 polytheists, pagans): &quot;If there had been other gods along with Him (God) as they assert, then they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne (seeking His Pleasures and to be near to Him). (42)\u00a0Glorified and High is He! From High above (the great falsehood) that they say! . (43)\u00a0The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.

The Thunderbolts project has plenty of videos which will show the contradiction between the theories of modern cosmological thinking and relativity and why it isnt impossible. Likewise two of the best videos you can watch that will not only duplicate, but will physically show how magnetic fields are actually set up and it will show exactly how the Jets are being formed.....David Lapoint three video series the primer Fields 1, 2 and 3, are the best videos that physically show the hexagonal patterns  you see  in magnetism, and what is actually feeling and generating light in Stars, explains the double slit experiment, and much more. When you actually read real scientific papers and you see how perplexed cosmologists are at what they find and how they are at a loss to really explain our universe, you will see why it&#39;s a shame that so many people just automatically take total theoretical thoughts pure fact and then spread it. I&#39;m working on a video in which this black hole with the intense so-called Event Horizon around it can be found on one of our planets.....yes, planet. I have a video of it and of course modern cosmologists and NASA won&#39;t even acknowledge this phenomenon. In fact it&#39;s the same process which creates the black Sun, and the occasional drastic flickering of the Sun. we&#39;re not talking about sunspots were talking about a giant black hole that when viewed from the right position on Earth she was a giant black hole right in the middle of the Sun that rotates And emits X-rays and gamma rays and ultraviolet rays around its Event Horizon, in this black hole has been known to shrink disappear and then pop right back come on sometimes it just remains there for quite some time. It&#39;s just the way that it&#39;s handling the vest loads and current of electricity that is being stored Within and flowing through. Call it what you will,  a black hole, but as the EU would refer to it, a plasmoid , because that is pretty much what it is. If conditions were right our son could just as easily be a so-called black hole just as it presents occasionally. And since gas wants to expand violently in space, it&#39;s virtually impossible for any mechanism to compressed gas down into any sort of compact point. magnetic fields an electrical birkeland currents and the Z pinch in fact are ten thousand times stronger than gravity...... And the EU predictions on just about every NASA mission proves to be accurate and true, and I&#39;m even finding my own stuff, including this overlooked black hole phenomenon on one of our planets, simply because I know what to look for when I start piecing together thousands of NASA clips based on the universe fueled by current, with gravity being on my a secondary effect of this Universal electrical charge and connection.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T08:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ATUL SINGH", "comment_text": "Thanos home..", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T08:27:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "parabab", "comment_text": "we out here making strides", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T08:27:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EEH", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/1112986/Black-hole-picture-end-of-the-world-first-black-hole-image-bible-prophecy/amp\">www.express.co.uk/news/weird/1112986/Black-hole-picture-end-of-the-world-first-black-hole-image-bible-prophecy/amp</a><br><br>A black hole is a perfect example of something we\u2019ve believed in even though we cannot see it or touch it.<br><br>I LOVE GOD JESUS THE GREAT \u2018I AM\u2019", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T08:27:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "misavn", "comment_text": "Meme", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T08:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clinical", "comment_text": "Interesting...

There&#39;s no equivalent to nature that protects us against nature itself... and why is nature so against us? Why does that have to be the way things are? We explain it with &quot;the circle of life&quot; but kf you can imagine a reality where one doesn&#39;t have to kill the other to survive, why can&#39;t it be made into a reality. Surely somewhere across the universe, there&#39;s a planet with plenty of natural food, so the creatures aren&#39;t forced to fight eachother, and any intelligent life can coexist without having to fight for survival. But we have a nature that&#39;s violent and unmerciful. A hurricane eats away entire islands, a lion kills the antelope to survive... why must we rely on death so we can live, only to die so something else can live? Existence is just draining life from other beings until ours is in turn drained or snuffed out. It feels like anything in the universe at any time could just swat the earth at any moment and end everything for us, why is it right that sny otherworldly consciousness that nature or the universe might have wouldn&#39;t care less about our extinction if that happened? That&#39;s a lonely and helpless feeling. With everything working against us, just existence is a fight. Money seems to almost be a mystical object in this world when it comes to day to day life, but really we&#39;re all just stuck on the same planet that at any time could burn, freeze, or break at any moment out of apparently nowhere. I guess we live happily because what&#39;s the alternative? Get crushed beneath the weight of the burdens we take on by surviving an ultimately pointless battle, or use what little control we have over our own fate to live our dreams before inevitably losing. We can conjure up all the resources we have to make our lives our own, and the biggest reason to do so and why... is why not. There&#39;s a choice we have to make. Even if happiness is a lie, it&#39;s a lie worth spreading. If we&#39;re all going to the same place, the road of travelers that believe they&#39;re going to paradise might enjoy the journey a little more than the road of travelers that believe they&#39;re going into a black hole. Maybe they both know there&#39;s nothing at the end, but one road makes that decision for the sake of rebelling against nature, our natural sworn enemy. A beautiful, seductive, rich enemy. But in the grand scheme of things, an enemy all the same. So why not choose how the story of the fight is told.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:10:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael Soothing ASMR", "comment_text": "Now we know where all the brains of flat earthers went!", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:10:27Z", "likes_count": 158}, {"comment_by": "SHAUNA VAYNE", "comment_text": "I hate math", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:10:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "betaneptune", "comment_text": "Nice, but please drop the tape-loop music.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:08:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niksung Longchari", "comment_text": "Blessed to be alive to see this.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:08:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "savagecub", "comment_text": "That\u2019s not a black hole, that\u2019s my asshole after I eat Hooters hot wings !", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:08:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "relaxing", "comment_text": "wow we can see this far but cant see inside other planets ?", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:08:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gian -", "comment_text": "flat earthers have disintegrated", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:08:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pony qi", "comment_text": "Black Hole chan when?", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:05:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josua Victory", "comment_text": "my yu gi oh card", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:03:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sayon Halder", "comment_text": "It does support the general theory of relativity", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:03:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlueHusky2154", "comment_text": "Background Music: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtwES8o9HM4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtwES8o9HM4</a><br><br>You&#39;re welcome.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:02:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Putri Nurshafa", "comment_text": "Like donuts", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:01:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CAPTAIN", "comment_text": "Looks like my asshole after I eat spicy food", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:01:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SabyMarie", "comment_text": "The eye of sauron exists", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T05:01:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dandi ex", "comment_text": "Someone have to print this image and bring it to hawking&#39;s graveyard", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:58:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nic_ 71", "comment_text": "Presently what it looks like nobody knows... this image far back in time", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ezzah", "comment_text": "Fake BS", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:58:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "All Hero No Cape", "comment_text": "Epic.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:57:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uvuvwevwevwe Onyentenyevwe Ugwemubwem Ossas", "comment_text": "Waiting for Elon Musk to say something about this.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:56:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammed Sinan", "comment_text": "Hoooohaaaa", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:56:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AGNA KALA", "comment_text": "Black hole? 55 millions years ahead!

However, this gas is super heated, giving it so much energy and angular momentum that it can&#39;t actually impact the black hole.

Most neutron stars discovered today are in the form of radio pulsars. They are called radio pulsars because they emit radio waves. We can simply connect a radio telescope to a loud speaker and hear a pulsar. Pulsars sound like someone persistently knocking. <br><br>The Quran describes a star by &quot;The one who knocks&quot;:<br><br>[Quran 86.1-3] And the heaven and the &quot;Knocker&quot; (Tarek in Arabic \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642) How could you know about the &quot;Knocker&quot;? The piercing star (Thakeb in Arabic).<br><br>The Arabic word &quot;Thukb \u062b\u0642\u0628&quot; means a hole; &quot;Thakeb \u062b\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0642\u0650\u0628\u064f&quot; means the one who makes the hole. The Quran is describing a knocking star that makes a hole.<br><br>Pulsars are rotating neutron stars. As more matter falls into a neutron star its mass increases and as its mass increases its gravity increases. But gravity is actually curvature of spacetime. A neutron star distorts spacetime. As more matter falls into a neutron star its distortion increases. A point will be reached where distortion would have grown so much that it makes a hole in spacetime.<br><br>How could a normal man who lived 1400 years ago have known that pulsars make holes in spacetime?<br><br>(Our sun is a very small star. Actually our solar system (including the atoms that you are made of) came from a dying star 100 times more massive than our sun. Some stars are even bigger than our solar system, so you can imagine how large stars are. However according to the Bible these stars are so small that they could fall on Earth: In Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_GVbuddri8&amp;t=13m24s\">13:24</a>-30 Jesus said that stars will fall on Earth before his second coming. Actually he said that stars will fall on Earth before even that generation passes away. However that generation passed away a long time ago and no star ever fell on Earth nor ever will. Do you know why? Because Earth will vaporize before it even contacts a star. So the events prophesied in the Bible are supposed to occur on Earth when Earth is already vaporized!)", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T12:40:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guru Mage", "comment_text": "A research on black holes but I can&#39;t find a single black guy on the team...", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T12:40:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fact Odyssey", "comment_text": "when black hole image is one of the best discovery of the century but people are making memes on it<br>scientists : <b>am i joke to you?</b>", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T12:39:35Z", "likes_count": 154}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Lepicard", "comment_text": "Were you in Physics HL?

The wildest planets from movies, and also inside your head most likely exists somewhere out there. And if the universe ends up being just one out of an infinite number of universes inside a multiverse, then we not only get everything we can imagine, but also every alternate reality as well, because there would be more universes than actual realities possible if that makes sense. That means there are infinite numbers of you and me out there with a different destiny each.

But not all images are created equal\u2014 some look more like what we think of as images than others. To chose the best image, we essentially take all of the infinite images that explain our telescope measurements, and rank them by how reasonable they look.  We then choose the image (or set of images) that looks most reasonable.<br> Using these algorithms we are able to reconstruct pictures from the very sparse measurements measured with the EHT. Below is a sample reconstruction done using simulated data generated from only 7 telescopes located around the world, and pretending to point at the black hole in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. Although this is just a simulation, reconstructions such as this give us hope that we soon will be able to to reliably take the first picture of the black hole.\r&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Ammonium Chloride", "comment_text": "<b>Spends decades working on a way to image a black hole</b><br><b>Finally succeeds</b><br>&quot;Whelp... looks like a hole.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaturnV Moon", "comment_text": "Pause <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_GVbuddri8&amp;t=1m59s\">1:59</a> and turning upside down that is about the angle", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niko", "comment_text": "Darker yet darker", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaston MacMillan", "comment_text": "Not knowing much about this I want to ask; as the black hole bends light/gravity, etc - would the viewing perspective always give the appearance of the columnated jets in the center of the field of view, coming right at you?", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0421\u0430\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "It\u2019s incredible.When I heart it first time ,I had a  creep.<br>Just thougth, that I living in time ,when  was get first picture of BLACK HOLE,makes me happy <br>It is absolutely exactly biggest step of humanity ever", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UAP NZ 06", "comment_text": "Boring and dumb", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bitcoin Motorist", "comment_text": "We don\u2019t use the word \u201cquasar\u201d anymore?", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:50:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Ray Morales", "comment_text": "I was waiting for this video. &lt;3", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:49:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devilforce988", "comment_text": "Sauron, is that you?", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bscutajar", "comment_text": "If we are looking almost exactly perpendicularly, why is one part brighter i.e. coming towards us?", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:49:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cameron", "comment_text": "But how big is the black whole?

Great, but then you say that because the jet appears to be coming almost directly towards us, that we&#39;re actually viewing the black hole from perpendicular to the accretion disk.
