When I was doing my aerospace masters in 1981, I had a project to simulate an unstable combat aircraft and then to add the effect of an active control system to stabilise and control it.

The reason was that analogue computers have the immediate response needed to bring a dynamically unstable systems under control without introducing nuisance and limit cycle oscillations. All artificial stability systems for aircraft at the time had an active end built as an analogue computer, even if the pilot input end was still digital. It was a very powerful lesson. As my tutor observed, in general with digital systems you can have fast or you can have powerful. With analogue computing, it&#39;s possible to make the sensor the source of power (as in aerodynamic servo tabs, the BAe146 regional jet has an entirely analogue pitch control system involving a devious concoction of pneumatic, aerodynamic and inertial devices), the result can be both fast (=responsive) and powerful.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T17:47:41Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Henry 21 Solstice 12", "comment_text": "21 Dec Solstice video!", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T21:54:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ULISES FONSECA", "comment_text": "a computer can be programmed and a calculator not", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T20:34:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean Rallis", "comment_text": "We take that little tide app on our phones for granted.

Over that distance, the target ship would appear tiny - if it is not over the horizon - and must require extraordinary accuracy, as moving the cannon through as little as 0.1 degrees would definitely put it off-target.  This accuracy has to be maintained, taking into account the rolling and pitching of the ship, and the motion of the target, assuming it is also a ship.  At full range, the cannon must not fire at where the other ship is, but at where it <b><i>will be</i></b> in 90 seconds.  When you see a ship in port, everything is moving very slowly, but at sea, they move along quite quickly, with a displacement of several lengths during the time of travel of the shell.

I tore apart a brass lighting fixture, one decorative component of which was a steel globe about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. It had a 3/8&quot; hole at the top and bottom. Some water had gotten inside and was rusty. In washing out the rust in my kitchen sink, the globe fell into and sealed the garbage disposal entrance. I wondered what would happen when as the water level rose in the sink. I supposed the globe would float at some point, allowing the water to drain out, and the lowering level would drop the globe back into the hole, reselling it. Thus it would be a crude regulator of level as the globe alternately floated and sank. But this did not happen! The globe remained in place until the water rose over the top of the globe whereupon some water began draining through the globe via the two 3/8&quot; holes. Yet the level continued to rise as there was more water from the faucet entering the sink than there was draining through the globe. After a half of inch more water entered, the globe suddenly popped up like a submarine surfacing. Then the sink drained around the globe. I repeated this, starting from an empty sink and saw the same result. What causes this, and what are the factors involved? I did not investigate (yet) what would happen if the axis of the 3/8&quot; holes was tilted vs. vertical.", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T09:13:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aditya Agarwal", "comment_text": "It&#39;s been a month please release the part 2\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T08:56:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Edward Namora", "comment_text": "Please discuss something about seas.

There are as of now two ways to compute stuff in an analog way. Mechanical and Electrical. Mechanical has failed us already. We had incredibly intricate machines, but for them to reach the same efficiency as mordern digital ways is quite impossible/impractical. <br>So only electrical remains. This is just... very very hard. For analog stuff to be mass produced, you need really good tolerances on every important part of the process or manually tune every single device. In the end, its probably easier to automate the tuning as well. So that may not stop us. Then there is the actual designing part. Stuff in analog electrics is incredibly non-linear. You have to deal with semiconductors (I will just assume that) and those vary harshly on a lot of variables, some are just purely statistical. Even if you use like 300nm processes, basically the oldest ones you will find in modern cpus, you would probably need VERY high computational power to simulate and error-correct analog computers so that they will work. And you cant do that for like one design and be done with it, no, your load gets increased exponentially for each component, since they can have infinite values. Right now there are tolerances. Like, one place on the chip may only ever get like 1.0 V instead of 1.2 V but thats fine for that place, another one gets 1.20 V and if it gets much lower, the chip will probably struggle. With analog, there is no such redundancy. Everything needs to be calculated PRECISELY. For modern chips this simulation alone would probably take years. And that would need to be run a few times, for each time you correct errors.<br><br>So all in all, at least with modern chips you wont get analog computing running. What I can imagine instead is a new kind of math used, like instead of boolean algebra some other algebra with 4 values instead of 2, or 8. That could drastically increase computational power. Quantum computing does something like that, tho in a very... special way. And then with time those 2 or 4 values may increase even more. But (to my knowledge) such math that is as complete as boolean algebra doesnt quite exist yet and for that to work, there will probably a penalty in terms of power consumption and design complexity. Every single part of a cpu would have to be redesigned and that in a more efficient way. That will only happen once we truly reach the borders of computing with the binary system, and I recon some stuff like light computing or smth will replace silicon computing sooner or later.", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T11:02:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Recreational Plutonium", "comment_text": "losers should have used FFT lol", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T11:00:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wei Cheng", "comment_text": "himm (hmm)..

This small print tells us that matter is not the seat of gravity. Newton uses the center of a mass as mathematical artifact purely for calculation, but when you \u201cgo\u201d to the center of any mass, you will find nothing there, gravity is zero at the center of any mass. It is therefore why mass has no \u201cweight\u201d onto itself. That can be shown mathematically, but let\u2019s approach it logically - which everything in physics must be done if you want to understand: if you want to know what Mount Everest weighs, you cannot plug in [W=m?g] with the full [g] of earth, you have to subtract the mass of the mountain from the mass of the earth and then calculate a new [g] for earth with which to multiply the mountains mass. Now, go on and take an ever greater junk of earth and recalculate the \u201cweight\u201d of it in respect to an ever decreasing mass of the \u201crest earth\u201d \u2026\u2026 when you finally arrive at the center and ask what the weight of the entire earth is in respect to a zero left over mass at the center, the result is zero: the weight of the entire earth is zero \u2026\u2026 the problem is that in everyday life we never talk about weight, we talk about mass. When we say we \u201cweigh\u201d 80kg we mean our mass, our weight is W=m?g=80kg?9,8m/s^2=784N\r<br>\r<br>Mass is NOT a force, Weight IS: F=m?a?W=m?g. Because bodies do not have weight \u201cin them\u201d, but only in respect to other masses, no mass has a force in it which could produce pressure, and therefore the concept of a self-pressurized sun is physically speaking nonsense. So is the idea that there is super high pressure at the center of earth. This fallacy can be easily shown mathematically, because the equation used to describe the pressure at the center of masses is P=??g?h. This is the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium which works fine to calculate the pressure of a column of water or at certain depths of the ocean - because you have value for [g]. At the center of any mass though, g=0 and therefore P=0. The center of a mass is NOT the seat of [g] and therein lies the authority of Newton.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\u201c\u2026.or they reach equilibrium with the environment.\u201d What do you mean by that? what is the result of such equilibrium.\u201d What I mean is, that in absence of an enclosure or any outside force a cloud of gas in space will expand until it reaches thermodynamic equilibrium with space (\u201cThe natural state of things is the vacuum of space\u201d as you put it) and that is a temperature of around 3K and pressure of something like e-18Pa. The amount of gas assumed to make up the sun would expand to a volume of V=nRT/P=4.2e51m^3. For comparison, that would be over 10 orders of magnitude larger than the Volume of the solar system with a radius of 120AU \u2026 V=4/3pr^3=2e40m^3\r<br>\r<br>\u201cGravity acts at molecular level, not in the formation of molecules.\u201d please forget gravity when talking molecules, which are formed by chemical bonds. The forces of these bonds are 30 orders of magnitude stronger than any gravity, that means gravity is less than negligible on that level.\r<br>\r<br>\u201cEach molecule interacts with the other\u2026.\u201d the only interaction between molecules in a gas is \u201cbouncing off each other\u201d, thus creating the pressure and temperature characterizing the state of a gas - only chemistry and electromagnetism is strong enough to influence and restrict that bouncing from within a gas, everything else has to come from outside, like the wall of an enclosure or gravity.", "comment_date": "2022-01-16T00:05:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rolled Dice", "comment_text": "What I wanted to really see is that Greek machine working in real life time and it will be great if it were Live stream", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T23:42:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "64-BIT", "comment_text": "Ive been able to recreate the machines shown with lego", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T23:34:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ela'amry Ela'amry", "comment_text": "Ancient Greek!

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgF3OX8nT0w&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead.

Anyway, the way Prof Zharkova did it was to collect several sine waves from the magnetic magneto-like activity of the Sun and she fed those sine waves into a program she acquired for free that produced the sum of those sine waves.  The Prof then back tested the resulting formula/algorithm using a dataset of solar activity going back to the ancient Chinese era to modern NASA satellite/probe data in order to prove the algorithm - it matched very closely.  On that foundation, the Prof then ran predictions for future global temperatures.

Advancements in machine learning are straining the capabilities of digital computers.&quot;<br>But.<br><br>For a while now I have been wondering whether these limits couldn&#39;t be overcome by letting go of the notion that digital computers only can work with 0 (no signal) and 1 (signal). What if we introduce 2: 0 (no signal), 1 (weak signal) and 2 (strong signal)? It is obvious how this would work in transmitting data through fiber optic cables. In cds and dvds you would have to manifacture two types of bumps/pits for this to work. Even in Derek&#39;s digital lego computer at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgF3OX8nT0w&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a> you could have a 0 (large, well, let&#39;s call it &quot;protrusion&quot;), 1 (small protrusion) and 2 (no protrusion).<br><br>In the current 0-1 system, two bits can hold values from 0-3. In the 0-1-2 system, two bits can store values from 0-8. That&#39;s a 125% gain.<br>This may be worth some research IMHO.

Then I can counter that quantum mechanics is only a boundary CFT approximation to a continuum bulk gravity theory. You see where this goes... the only way we ever need to worry if nature/spacetime is discrete or continuous is when it makes a dime of a difference, and no one has shown it does, although &quot;discrete&quot; (in physics jargon) is just a dirty word for continuous but multiply connected --- all the Wolfram hypergraph and LQG sh*t has to have connections between nodes/spins, so they are not discrete. And I can approximate any such network with a smooth multiply-connected spacetime (using wormholes, which btw from Coleman&#39;s work can potentially fix the fundamental constants).  Graph theory is placed under &quot;discrete mathematics&quot; because of the topological index, not because of the lack of connectivity.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours.

There are numerous cases in which digital computers falter, notably in cases where fine detail is required, because each additional doubling of accuracy requires a doubling of the entire detail of the system. With analog computing, we can factor for the amount of needed detail more accurately, as the function being used can be tailored to provide extreme levels of detail without having to resort to the brute force equivalent used in the digital realm. We&#39;ll no longer be in the realm of &quot;higher clock speeds, more cores, larger caches, and lower delays between components&quot; and instead in the realm of smarter components that are able to conform more cleanly to use cases. This will hopefully provide the solution to the ever-growing &quot;internet of things&quot; issue, where every device and its mother currently needs a digital microprocessor in it to interface with other devices.<br><br>And of course, this is all closely paralleled by the similar concepts in the world of music technology.

I hope to see the trend of ever-shrinking components applied to physical and analog methodologies, such that we have microscopic things that are able to handle ranges of values.

A proximity fuze uses radio signals that reduce in frequency as the projectile approaches an object, magnetic and sonar systems were tried and all failed due to the violence of the forces encountered as a round is fired.  As for the calculations these computers did for anti aircraft purposes against dive bombers, the truth is the computers did nothing, and it was so secret that even anti aircraft gunners had no idea that the dial to adjust the altitude at which the round detonated was fake.

Circular disc connected to bar that has magnets embedded in it&#39;s top side  all around, surrounded in high permeability material to focus magnets outward pushing force in an upwards direction from top of disc. <br> Segment 2: Hollowed out cylindrical Bar of material horizontally positioned. <br>donut shaped platter that&#39;s flattened on all sides instead of rounded, all around the flat edge of this platter, from the center is a ravine in the center so structure looks more like 2 donut shaped platters flattened on all sides &amp; sandwiched together against a smaller donut shaped platter that&#39;s flattened not rounded &amp; between them both. Square openings are located all around the outside of platters edge on both sides &amp; goes all the way through material. In these openings rectangular magnets surrounded in high permeability casings are slid into place all around platter in a matching pattern on both sides. N facing in then S facing in. <br>Connect these securely all along the length of the horizontally positioned bar except at far ends and center.<br>At both ends of horizontally positioned bar securely connect a ring of material that can be magnetically repelled (This will allow bar to spin when apart of completed construct)<br>  Build a hollow ring structure that has ring of magnetic repulsion around its inner ring that will be able to fit around main horizontally positioned bar and keep it from touching anything on account of the bar sitting on its magnetic field inside the ring. The ring structure has a rectangular bar protruding from it&#39;s outer edge &amp; has small square platform on end of it that will allow it to be screwed in to another structure.  Make 3 of these ring structures &amp; position them (approx) over both ends of horizontally positioned bar &amp; around it&#39;s center.<br>  Build hollowed out rectangular encasement that is separated into 2 pieces that can be placed on top of each other and screwed together. This encasement will fit over horizontal bar &amp; everything that is immediately around this bar. Encasement needs areas all along it&#39;s top side that has screw openings that all structures inside that need to be fastened down will be able to screw into. (Best if encasement is transparent) Encasement has round opening at both ends so when in place horizontally positioned bar with round magnetically repel-able disc attached to it  are sticking out.<br>  Build hollowed out ring structure (flattened not rounded) that has a hollowed out rectangular bar that protrudes from top and bottom of ring and has square platform at end of each that will be able to screw into inside of encasement on top and bottom. Ring structure should be able to separate into 4 halves (from middle separating top &amp; bottom &amp; from side to side on each) that sit on top of each other &amp; side by side perfectly connected when encasement is closed. Hollowed out aspect of ring structure &amp; it&#39;s protruding hollowed out bar that&#39;s connected to it is for conductive wiring to be placed so that the copper coil constructs not mentioned yet will be able to plug into this ring structure and the current can be diverted up through the hollowed out area to a point where another device can plug into it. On bottom of hollowed out ring structure there are openings where copper coil constructs can be plugged into. <br>  Build wide but small ring with ravine around its outer edge in center (kinda would look like the round metal piece you would see in a pulley system but not angled in) of structure (flat not rounded &amp; not hollow in center). Copper coil will be coiled around this. Build hollowed out rectangular structure the length of the width of the wide small ring structure. Build a plug system within it so at the center of the rectangular structure it has proper electrical plug poking out that will be able to plug into bottom side of larger ring structure that is designed to divert current. At both ends of small rectangular plug system there should be flat rectangular legs hanging down so that you can fit it perfectly over center of small wide ring structure that has copper coil wound around it &amp; screw openings at bottom of these flat rectangular legs so they can be screwed together. Ends of the copper coil are fed up into the plug securely. <br>With wiring in place screw top halves of ring structure together still separate from bottom halves. Then with wiring in place screw bottom halves of ring structure together. Now screw the already connected top halves to the inner top encasement structure &amp; same for bottom halves. Two main encasement structures still disconnected at this point. (Fine point... there are as many of these ring structures with copper coil constructs plugged into them as there are the magnetic disc constructs lined up across the length of the horizontal bar) This is because they are all to be lined up. Now with everything ready carefully lift up the Horizontal bar with the magnetic disc setup securely attached to it. At this point the magnetically repelling rings that are at far ends and center of bar should be hanging freely. Carefully position this whole thing in the bottom encasement so the copper coils are positioned perfectly in the ravine of the magnetic disc area connected to bar. Line the free hanging magnetic rings that have rectangle bars and square platforms up with the inner bottom of encasement and screw them in. At this point the horizontal bar is sitting on the magnetic fields in the rings and is securely in place connected to bottom encasement. Now pick up the top of encasement and carefully line it up the same but on top &amp; then screw the top encasement to the bottom encasement. If lined up properly you will see that when the horizontally positioned bar is made to spin, the magnetic fields will interact with the coils that are perpendicular to the magnetic field lines and since the copper coils are positioned to hang withing the ravine, the magnets on both sides will magnify the effect to achieve greater results &amp; since the magnets on both sides are set up N then S all the way around it will end up being AC current. At this point you may be wondering how will this ever equate to over unity? well we are about to get to the part that makes that possible. <br>  Build cylindrical structure (like a donut but flat not rounded on all sides but still hollow in center like a donut). The cylindrical structure is built in 2 parts. Top part &amp; bottom part. Bottom half has a ridge close to bottom center area that circles around further into the center but not all the way in. On top of this ridge is a flat ring of high permeability (magnetic field shielding) material that has small openings that will allow magnetic fields through specific locations. The top flat side of the 1st part has rectangular grooves cut into it that go almost the entire distance from outside of cylindrical structure to hollowed out center. At both the outer edge and inner edge it instead cuts down sharply &amp; narrowly at just over the width of the horizontal bar. This way when the horizontal bar in it&#39;s encasement is sitting in this spot the case fits down in and bar slides down in with a little extra space but the encasement can&#39;t shift forwards &amp; backwards. The top half of cylindrical structure has same groove but no extended ridge going further towards center. Fill the rest of the rectangular grooves with duplicates of the electric generator construct. Now carefully position top of cylindrical structure in place and screw it to bottom section. Now position the motor segment with the vertical bar that has discs on it in center of cylindrical construct so the disc is lined up perfectly underneath the inner ridge that has the flat ring of high permeability material fastened to it. Now you can duplicate this whole setup and stack it for more electrical output. (The only thing that would need to be duplicated with the motor &amp; vertical bar setup is for you to add another disc with magnets embedded in it, higher up on the vertical bar you are already using). When you turn motor on the discs will spin and the magnetic fields on them will only interact with the discs on the horizontally positioned bars when the magnetic field lines go through the small openings in the high permeability material. Since those openings are lined up with the edge of the discs connected to the horizontally positioned bars, it will force them to spin, effectively generating lots of electrical current. Just make sure to let enough of that current pump energy into the 1 motor you are using to run things, and the rest of the electric current is over unity. If you are still wondering how this could end up being over unity, the answer is simple. The device exploits magnetic field effects connected to the vertically positioned bar connected to the motor to have them do all the extra work so the motor does not have to. And since the magnets are exerting there force upwards while the bar spins around sideways, the motor won&#39;t be getting a detrimental amount of push back.

Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY..

Well, that discussion resulted in a task for me to design and build one.  What I ended putting together was a box with 10 op-amps, a bunch of stackable resistors and capacitors and a few special units,  and a panel with banana sockets for the stackable components.  All along with amplifier symbols on the panel.  The signal range was reduced to just +/</del> 10 V.

I actually designed and physically made such a computer somewhere in 2017 to 2018, and it wan&#39;t a complex research but just a small hobby project in some of my free time next to college. the prototype was handmade and was build very badly but it worked and demonstrated that my design was indeed capable of doing it. now it wasn&#39;t exactly a mechanical computer, or analog computer as many know it, since I designed it to work on the exact same principle as which I had described in one of my theories as a more simplistic yet detailed description of all forces in the universe, where I could simplify all things down to one simplistic rule, or actually 2, where the second one just tells about the existence of dimensions both or either in a physical or abstract way, with in this case the main intend to allow the combination of anything that can exist, and yet to each other might never exist into one result(much more simple in imagination, it is just saying that there exist possibilities, since a calculation or theory wouldn&#39;t have much value on a prediction level if that what it needs to predict according to the theory can not exist(it is much more simple than it seems in this explanation when you can just visualize it). the other thing was that specific rule which generates and handles all forces in the universe. so to put it more simply it has 2 rules: the description of force and space .  that the computer worked did prove that my theory was either right or at least so close to truth that you can not or barely notice a difference. I did another experiment as well where I together with a cousin managed to simulate space and atomic behavior in realtime and high accuracy with a quite primitive setup(for now).<br>but the computer I designed and made was in behaviour most easily comparable to a quantum computer which works on room temperature, and its working principle can be most easily described as the force which keeps molecules together or planets, such as gravity but then not using weight but by actively manipulating the force I didn&#39;t exactly use gravity but a different force I could generate using something I will call the Rtype-crown, however detailing to much about that will likely explain the entire working of the device. but to put it simple it is one specific component I designed to be cheap and simple to make, which can simulat all digital computing as well as analog and quantum where its natural computing method is closest to quantum computing.", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T22:52:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRealJanZ", "comment_text": "in 2022 we have many 2&#39;s; and zero&#39;s; 02-02-2022, 12-02-2022, 22-02-2022 ( eh 02-(February=02)- 2022. 12- February -2022, 22-February-2022.

They will be weeping and gnashing their teeth (Matthew 8:12). Between their sobs, they will not speak the words \u201cI\u00a0want\u00a0this.\u201d They will not be able to say amid the flames of the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14), \u201cI\u00a0want\u00a0this.\u201d \u201cThe smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night\u201d (Revelation 14:11). No one\u00a0wants\u00a0this.<br><br>When there are only two choices, and you choose against one, it does not mean that you want the other, if you are ignorant of the outcome of both. Unbelieving people know neither God nor hell. This ignorance is not innocent. Apart from regenerating grace, all people \u201csuppress the truth in unrighteousness\u201d (Romans 1:18).<br>The person who rejects God does not know the real horrors of hell. This may be because he does not believe hell exists, or it may be because he convinces himself that it would be tolerably preferable to heaven. But whatever he believes or does not believe, when he chooses against God, he is wrong about God\u00a0and\u00a0about hell. He is not, at that point, preferring the\u00a0real\u00a0hell over the real God. He is blind to both. He does not perceive the true glories of God, and he does not perceive the true horrors of hell.<br><br>So when a person chooses against God and, therefore,\u00a0de facto\u00a0chooses hell \u2014 or when he jokes about preferring hell with his friends over heaven with boring religious people \u2014 he does not know what he is doing. What he rejects is not the real heaven (nobody will be boring in heaven), and what he\u00a0wants\u00a0is not the real hell, but the tolerable hell of his imagination.<br>When he dies, he will be shocked beyond words. The miseries are so great he would do anything in his power to escape. That it is not in his power to repent does not mean he\u00a0wants\u00a0to be there. Esau wept bitterly that he could not repent (Hebrews 12:17). The hell he was entering into he found to be totally miserable, and he wanted out. The meaning of hell is the scream: \u201cI hate this, and I want out.\u201d<br><br>Thrown into Hell<br><br>What sinners want is not hell but sin. That hell is the inevitable consequence of unforgiven sin does not make the consequence desirable. It is not what people want \u2014 certainly not what they \u201cmost want.\u201d Wanting sin is no more equal to wanting hell than wanting chocolate is equal to wanting obesity. Or wanting cigarettes is equal to wanting cancer.<br>Beneath this misleading emphasis on hell being what people \u201cmost want\u201d is the notion that God does not\u00a0send\u00a0people to hell. But this is simply unbiblical. God certainly does send people to hell. He does pass sentence, and he executes it. Indeed, worse than that. God does not just\u00a0send, he\u00a0throws. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s name was not found written in the book of life, he was\u00a0thrown\u00a0into the lake of fire\u201d (Revelation 20:15; cf.\u00a0Mark 9:47;\u00a0Matthew 13:42;\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgF3OX8nT0w&amp;t=25m30s\">25:30</a>).<br><br>The reason the Bible speaks of people being\u00a0thrown\u00a0into hell is that no one will willingly go there once they see what it really is. No one standing on the shore of the lake of fire jumps in. They do not\u00a0choose\u00a0it, and they will not\u00a0want\u00a0it. They have chosen sin. They have wanted sin. They do\u00a0not\u00a0want the punishment. When they come to the shore of this fiery lake, they must be thrown in.<br><br>Jesus\u2019s Blazing Words<br><br>When someone says that no one is in hell who doesn\u2019t want to be there, they give the false impression that hell is within the limits of what humans can tolerate. It inevitably gives the impression that hell is less horrible than Jesus says it is.<br><br>We should ask, \u201cHow did Jesus expect his audience to think and feel about the way he spoke of hell?\u201d The words he chose were not chosen to soften the horror by being accommodating to cultural sensibilities. He spoke of a \u201cfiery furnace\u201d (Matthew 13:42), and \u201cweeping and gnashing of teeth\u201d (Luke 13:28), and \u201couter darkness\u201d (Matthew 25:30), and \u201ctheir worm [that] does not die\u201d (Mark 9:48), and \u201ceternal punishment\u201d (Matthew 25:46), and \u201cunquenchable fire\u201d (Mark 9:43), and being \u201ccut in pieces\u201d (Matthew 24:51).<br><br>These words are chosen to portray hell as an eternal, conscious experience that no one would or could ever\u00a0want\u00a0if they knew what they were choosing. Therefore, if someone is going to emphasize that people freely\u00a0choose\u00a0hell, or that no one is there who doesn\u2019t\u00a0want\u00a0to be there, surely he should make every effort to clarify that, when they get there, they will\u00a0not\u00a0want this.<br>Surely the pattern of Jesus \u2014 who used blazing words to blast the hell-bent blindness out of everyone \u2014 should be followed. Surely, we will grope for words that show no one, no one,\u00a0no one\u00a0will\u00a0want\u00a0to be in hell when they experience what it really is. Surely everyone who desires to save people from hell will not mainly stress that it is\u00a0wantable\u00a0or\u00a0chooseable,\u00a0but that it is horrible beyond description \u2014 weeping, gnashing teeth, darkness, worm-eaten, fiery, furnace-like, dismembering, eternal punishment, \u201can abhorrence to all flesh\u201d (Isaiah 66:24).<br><br>I thank God, as a hell-deserving sinner, for Jesus Christ my Savior, who became a curse for me and suffered hellish pain that he might deliver me from the wrath to come.

You should research it more. Moore&#39;s law might be dead in its original form, but scaling is far from over. Transistors are no where near as small as atoms.

The only commercial products in 5nm node are Apple&#39;s M1 chips so far (there are plenty in the pipe, but not yet on the market). So we are gonna wait at least for a year or two (specially due to current bottlenecks in production) before 5nm becomes a norm. And TSMC has already 3nm in advanced state with a promising yield. Moreover, each node has many iterations where each iteration improves power consumption yielding higher Hz/W performance.<br>What we know for certain is that current scaling is not gonna stop until at least 1nm node. That is 10 years from now and probably a factor of 15-30x in performance compared to the current 7nm node.", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T13:43:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Talal Yousif", "comment_text": "Hats off to the animators of this channel.

Even for German bombers, roughly 90% made it back home during all but the final weeks of the war, most that didn&#39;t were taken out by fighter aircraft or fuel shortages. A more accurate number would be for every tonnage of aircraft brought down by flack, 15 tons of anerican AA ammunition would be used up, and 18 tons for German AA, But again, its not the metric for success, since the AA&#39;s job is not to take out aircraft. It is also noteworthy that the German AA was far more effective throughout the war due to their heavy relying on synchronised strategic firing. In essence they would fire as a battery in front of a formation in a screen, making aircraft have to fly through a big square of exploding flack. Even if every shot itself was less accurate and in fact not even aimed at a specific aircraft, an entire formation would be peppered with fragments of a bunch of rounds all at once.

Huntec&#39;s answer was an accelerometer inside their profiler, the output of which was fed into two integrators, which translated the measured acceleration of the profiler into displacement. This displacement was then applied to the sonar signal in the form of an analogue delay, which (amazingly) removed the wave movement. <br><br>The electronics in that device were simply amazing (like a Swiss watch), and I still take my hat off to the small team who designed and built it!", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T10:31:56Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Paul Gloor", "comment_text": "An analogue comeback is basically a non quantum &quot;quantum&quot; computer.

The switches served the part of circuit wiring. A digital program configured the analog circuits into any algorithm or multivariable equation to suit. This gave you the ability to input many variable values simultaneously while generating an output in real-time. The only processing &#39;speed limit&#39; was determined by the slew rates of the amplifier components used ... I used only generic op amps for the project because they cost only pennies per package.

Also just to get it out of the way though I&#39;m sure someone else mentioned it, proximity fuses are the huge difference in why planes were easier to shoot down with anti-aircraft artillery.  The directors definitely helped - particularly with radar input - since they could figure out target speed and course and figure out where to aim, but performing any sort of evasive maneuvers would be enough to dodge it due to the time of flight to get an artillery shell up to the plane&#39;s altitude.  Also the Norden (and the other powers&#39; alternatives, Germany&#39;s actually being simpler) was very accurate, with solid testing and training showing a circular error probable of just 75 feet in pre-war.  The reason the CEP for all belligerent nations in combat was around 2300 feet is because of things like being shot at and only having reliable wind data from a weather balloon perhaps once a day at the airfield you took off at and not at your target location.  Having accurate bomb sights still made a massive difference though and shouldn&#39;t be understated.<br><br>In any case I have to say I&#39;m disappointed you didn&#39;t mention gun fire control systems for naval artillery.  Particularly for the larger ships, from late 19th Century pre-dreadnoughts to modern battleships, there was space to put in large analog computers.  Without analog computers to calculate trajectories and compensate for the pitching motion from waves, effective engagement ranges would have still only been around what they could have managed with cannons.  In comparison,  while the actual hit percentage of WW2 naval engagements was around 1%, they could often open up at targets over the horizon.  Having fire-control radar even allowed for fairly long engagement ranges at night.  Some of the major examples are the USS Washington easily managing to shell the Kirishima only some 5.3 km away during the Battle of Guadalcanal and the USS West Virginia during the Battle of Leyte Gulf managing a hit on her opening salvo against Yamashiro at a range of over 20 km.", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T01:46:46Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Gilliam Logan", "comment_text": "&quot;The story is too good to be buried 20 minutes in&quot; makes us wait for an entire extra video instead.

However, it&#39;s not that engineers are dumb, that&#39;s not that simple. <br><br>There is the precision and noise problem that you pointed out, digital component can easily erase noise and restore a digital signal which is very interresting to transmit data over the distance. But in that&#39;s not the most important point. We are curently already creating quantum compter which require extreme precision,  but there isn&#39;t any decisive project for analog computers yet.<br><br><br>In fact in the case of computing the true game changer is timing! Most analog components have time based behaviours, they use analog values of physical constants like voltage, intensity, etc. that doesn&#39;t change instantly because they tightly binded to physics laws. When you have a few component moving over a few minutes like old computers presented in the video, it&#39;s no big deal, but the nightmare start when you try assembling million, billion or even more of them and syncronizing them at the micro-second or nano-second. And th is not a trivial problem.<br>On the other side, the main advantage of digital gates is that they are syncronized on a clock. There is a regular clock in your computers (today usually around 4 GHz) and all the memory cells that store bits of data in your computer change there state at the same time when this clock tic. The clock period is designed to be long enough to be sure that every electronic component in the whole computer chip had the time it needed to update its electric state and stabilize its value. Some components would probably take less time than that, but in the end we are garanteed that all electronic signals are stable and reliable. Just with that hypothesis all simulation tools and computer designer can make an enormous simplification by just ignoring all time related physical behaviour and instead focus on a much much much simpler finit state automata. If you look at a processor simulation tool used by computer architects you would not see anything related to voltage, intensity, or physic equations, because all of that is neglected and instead we can focus on much simpler binary signals.<br><br>In fact I lied a bit, in practice at the level of miniaturization we reached, we still had to deal with noise, interferance, etc. but that&#39;s mostly solved globaly by building robust components and adding shielding around chips when needed, an not by solving the exact physical equaltion between every single electronic components.<br><br>It&#39;s not that no body tried to do analogus computer but, in history, since the transistor was invented, it has always been simpler and more efficient to reduce complexity with digital computing and compensating by an increased clock speed, adding more parallel transitors computation or a more optimized chip architecture, that trying to work out the complexe equations of billions of analogous electronic components.<br><br>It&#39;s a little bit like an intersection with traffic lights. It&#39;s theoritically possible that everyone pass the intersection at almost full speed by precisely computing everyone&#39;s speed.

One such detail was that I built an analog computer for a grade school science fair. I believe I was about 10 and the year was around 1972 or 3. My dad designed jet engines for Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft and I was always drawn to math, science and music. I went to the town library looking for books of interesting science projects. I found a book of home science projects using simple, inexpensive items. It had a plan for a simple, cigar box, &quot;analog computer.&quot; By your definition here I think it was really a simple  digital computer. It used a cigar box, those copper pins you use with punched whole paper to bind pages together, some wires and some small low power incandescent bulbs. You could add single digit numbers by turning the dials on one and then the number to sum on the other. It showed the result by lighting the appropriate bulb. I blindly accepted the name &quot;analog computer&quot; because it used no transistors or ICs. But unlike the analog computers you showed, there were discrete digits. I think it was a primitive digital computer which is even more impressive for someone in 5th grade. The school system made note of my STEM aptitude. About 3 year later, I was selected as one of 6 kids to go use a PDP11 that had been donated to the school. The other kids were all high schoolers. I was bussed over from the middle school where we were through 9th grade. There was no terminal or printer. Just the PDP11 unit with the dip switches and lights on the front. The other kids goofed off and called it a free day. I taught myself the machine language and figured out how to input two numbers, and yet again, add them. The teachers later told me no one had figured out how to use the thing and asked me how I did it. I said &quot;I studied the thing, read the little manual, and taught myself binary on the spot. They had no idea what I was talking about. Both of these things were extraordinary opportunities. I hope someone reads this and realizes the power of curiosity and critical thinking skills. This was a public school in South Windsor CT and not some fancy private school. Opportunities surround us everyday. All we need to do is seize them.

We built analog control systems that ran on air or voltage to control industrial processes. Even with air pressure we could add, subtract, multiply, divide, integrate, differentiate, keep time, store data and build complex algorithms without any electricity involved. Electronic analog computers using operational amplifiers could do this faster and more accurately. The first digital control computers Foxboro built we designed in house, we wrote the real time operating systems, and wrote the applications. They were so slow we worried about control loop response times. We programmed in assembly and machine language to make these expensive machines as fast as possible, and the software was written as function blocks that mimicked analog computer functions like PID controllers to regulate say temperature or pressure. Watching how digital software and hardware evolved over the years was fascinating but many measurement are made with analog sensors so the analog world is still alive.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T23:31:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Electronic Hobbyist", "comment_text": "There&#39;s a great story by Arthur Clarke called &quot;The Last Question&quot;, written in a time before digital computing existed, and assumed that analog computers would continue to be the way the technology would progress.

You might think it&#39;s odd that integrating and differentiating are easier than multiplication, but this comes from the fact that your opamp circuit can include capacitors and inductors, whose behaviours are dictated by equations involving derivatives and integrals.

I also will make a comment about where I think your next video is headed.<br><br>I think everyone knows that Digital Computers have gone through an insane cost reduction and power growth curve at the same time.  This doesn&#39;t just include processing power but power, memory and storage as well.  Analog Computers have not been anywhere near as scalable to date.  In a massive oversimplification, the noise problem that is mentioned carries over into analog devices in many ways.  This means that analog electronics just has not been able to go through that same revolution cost, processing, and storage revolution.<br><br>The second problem is exhibited throughout the presentation.  That is that Analog Computers, as we know them today, solve one problem at a time.  We have yet to come up with an effective way of creating the equivalent of software to drive the development of analog computers.  Imagine having a different computers to run YouTube, Netflix, Gmail, etc.  You can make make analog computers out of general purpose components, but you would have to reconfigure them to run different applications.  I am old enough to have to have &quot;programmed&quot; analog computers to solve circuit problems in Engineering school.  The computations to set them up correctly to make good waveforms often took hours or days.  <br><br>So, I suspect where Derek is heading is a new burst of neural network research.  These have been around a long time and are intended to emulate the working of the human brain, which would theoretically lead to a general purpose Analog Computer.  Will be interesting to see if anything meaningful has been done in the last 30+ years (which is the last time I paid attention to this).  We could make 10ish neurons at that time and had found some ways to solve specific problems with learning.
