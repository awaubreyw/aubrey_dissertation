Mark McGwire was a very big guy, used a big bat and had a powerful downswing. He admittedly tried to hit the bottom third of the baseball to create backspin. The batting practice was a sight to behold. While there were a few other players in MLB who could hit the ball nearly as far, no one had the height and soar like McGwire. The ball would hang high in the air, like it was wanting to stay up there, and carry quite far. I am speaking the truth when I say the next ball he hit would be on its way before the first one even landed. So trying to catch them in the stands felt like juggling. It was very entertaining for everyone trying to catch the souvenirs. <br><br>Say what you may about him cheating but I\u2019ve never seen anyone hit a baseball like that before, during or after his time.

The ball spinning does affect the speed of the layer of air in touch with it, making it that the air gets speeded up (or less slowed down) than in the other side. Bernoulli&#39;s principe explains that the energy of air flow depends on speed, preassure (related with temperature aswell) and potential energy in form of graviational potential energy. In the case of the ball the air flow doesn&#39;t change altitude nor mass so that gravitational energy remains constant. But as in one side the air moves faster than the other, the faster side has less preassure than the slower side, which creates a force from the high preassure side to the low preassure side.

You see what I mean?<br>EDIT: Oh wait I get it now, I guess the ball has little resistance against the air so that allows it to easily spin along the air on the right and the left air blowing over it pushes it away from the right air, so that makes sense, yeah. It&#39;s just that if the ball&#39;s spin <i>was</i> fully resisted by the air, then the diagram would make no sense. And even then, the diagram could still be wrong if the air had enough resistance on the ball&#39;s spin to overpower the amount of spin you applied to it and thus not allow it to spin.", "comment_date": "2019-11-27T20:57:41Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jvyrdn", "comment_text": "I f you jump with multiple backflips maybe you&#39;ll hit the water and survive, pls try", "comment_date": "2019-11-27T15:48:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0418\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u0440 \u0425\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "<b>\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e</b>", "comment_date": "2019-11-27T11:53:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Welcome", "comment_text": "For some reason I thought there&#39;d be a hoop at the end.

In the case of the basketball there are two magnus effect operating. one is in vertical direction due to which the ball is drifting in horizontal direction. and second is in horizontal direction which is due to movement of air in horizontal direction and it will cause the drifting in vertical direction and of course gravity is also acting in the vertical direction....<br>So the person gives the ball a backspin and the ball goes away from person this suggests that the air is moving from down to up i.e from earth to atmosphere(1st q ues. how can air move from down to up i.e from earth to atmosphere).<br>Also the ball slows down a bit when approaching near water that means force due to magnus effect is upwards which suggests that the air is moving towards the dam (i.e in direction from the water body towards the dam).<br>and i guess this is how those airplanes are working .so what if wind speeds are low such that <br>force due to magnus effect is not strong enough than force due to gravity. Or the wind direction suddenly changes. So the direction cylinder should also be changed otherwise the plane would fall down but with more force than gravitational force itself as the force due to magnus effect will also add with gravity...........<br>i thought about a solution but it will only work if the force due to magnus effect is independent of mass of material(so second question- is it dependent or independent of mass of material.)

After watching this video i was inspired to try to come up with a practical approach to creating another type of magnus powered airplane, so heres the idea i would like tested. Imagine an aircraft shaped like a simple cylinder, now imagine a cone on the front end of the cylinder pointing outward and its widest diameter being slightly larger than the diameter of the cylinder. Now imagine that the surface of the cone is coated in carbon nanotubes of varying lengths arranged in a repeating step pattern of an arbitrarily chosen number of increments and overall pattern repetitions spiraling counter to the direction of rotation from the cones point all the way to its greatest circumference. My hope is that the spiraling nanotubes, while the cone is in rotation will drag the air back across its surface throwing it out away from the sides of the craft tword the back which in theory would create a low enough pressure in front of the cone to propel the craft forward due to the high prussure of the slow or stagnant air at back end of the cylinder, the reason for the stepping pattern of the carbon nanotubes is to ensure that the air just doesnt become trapped inbetween the tubes creating a nearly frictionless bubble of air which would produce no lift. please let me know what you think and what type of software would be helpful in designing and testing such a device, all replies are welcome though im very intrested in dereks take on my idea, thank you", "comment_date": "2016-07-27T19:48:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Jansen", "comment_text": "Unfortunately, th record is already broken by DudePerfect", "comment_date": "2016-07-27T17:27:11Z", "likes_count": 75}, {"comment_by": "Hallands", "comment_text": "All very well and good, but that wasn&#39;t backspin !", "comment_date": "2016-07-26T21:43:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sairam Kukkadapu", "comment_text": "I knew about the Bernoulli principle first but then I figured out it was just like the Magnus effect", "comment_date": "2016-07-26T16:29:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheydinal", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OSrvzNW9FE&amp;t=0m55s\">0:55</a> Bernie is that you?", "comment_date": "2016-07-17T00:04:38Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Kyle", "comment_text": "It&#39;s like the bicycle glide in GTA 5 lol", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T12:51:43Z", "likes_count": 67}, {"comment_by": "Devaldy Jonathan", "comment_text": "Tyrone?", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T07:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_ISO_", "comment_text": "isnt that how airsoft BBS fly so far", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T13:10:25Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "fulfulfulfulful", "comment_text": "boring", "comment_date": "2016-06-22T18:08:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darrell Hoberer", "comment_text": "Bravo!

Also, pro golfers are really good at producing various spins to shape their shots and control the bounces and rolls when the ball lands - such as the hook shot Bubba Watson hit from the trees to win the 2012 Masters.

Do you guys think it&#39;s possible? I mean obviously its &quot;possible&quot; but there are lots of engineering hurdles to overcome (contrasting gyroscopic forces is the first to come to mind). One interesting thing when doing the numbers is that the diameter of tube is by far the most important factor. A slow moving 4&#39; diameter tube can have more lift than high rpm thinner tubes. I&#39;m not talking about fighter jets here, because large diameter means large drag, but Im thinking more along the lines of 2 big, slow,  tubes lifting up maybe a person in a seat, hoverbike, or similar, trading speed for lift.

So total acting force will be higher in bottom to top direction will that make planes more efficient?

It came with heavy plastic balls, as well as much lighter balls made of Styrofoam. If the lighter ball was launched with enough back-spin, the ball would actually loop-the-loop. Inspired by this, I began experimenting with cylinders from ink pens. Finding a smooth, round cylinder with no taper, and about three inches long, the cylinder could be launched by placing it between two heavy books near the far end. While applying pressure to the top book, and sliding it slowly back, the cylinder could be spit out the forward end with enough back-spin to cause it to loop-the-loop as well. It was amazing to see because there was almost no forward momentum. It seemed to hover. That must have been the Magnus effect. I was astonished because the lift created was counterintuitive. The leading edge of the cylinder was rotating up, and yet the cylinder rose against it.<br><br>Love your show.

(the magnus effect, obviously) The point of curiosity though is in the barrel. You see the backspin is applied at the very beginning of the barrel, the chamber end. There has been much speculation about what the BB actually does going down the barrel prior to its exit.\u00a0<br><br>What actually does happen? Well, surprisingly, experiments show the BB rides on the ceiling. Nobody has explained why this is though, and the results have become so controversial quite a number of physicists who&#39;ve seen it have flat out denied the results of the experiments.\u00a0<br><br>So the question is why does this behavior occur?<br><br><b>edit</b> <br>I feel I should make this a little bit more clear: the BB is driven down the barrel by air pressure from behind, and is not a gas-seal with the barrel. Because of this, while in the barrel, the BB could be seen as traveling in the opposite direction relative to the air in certain respects; the BB should hypothetically display &quot;topspin&quot; and the magnus effect would drive it downward toward the floor rather than ceiling. This is why our observations that it does not is so surprising. <br><br>The experimental methodology used to determine the BB&#39;s behavior in the barrel was to coat the bore evenly with scribing fluid, fire a few hundred rounds through it, and then either scope the bore or cut it open. The wear patterns in the scribing fluid show the BB&#39;s location. Furthermore, particularly in soft brass barrels, longitudinal scratches in the bore can be observed from where the BB contacts. These are also found on the BB ceiling. They are also fairly long and even, suggesting that the BB truly is riding on the ceiling, rather than oscillating rapidly &quot;bouncing&quot; or anything like that.", "comment_date": "2015-07-15T15:17:27Z", "likes_count": 36}, {"comment_by": "Aneesh Sompalli", "comment_text": "This is so cool!
