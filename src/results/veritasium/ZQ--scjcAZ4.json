The things are still awesome, I collect rocks so I appreciate minerals, crystals but I don&#39;t think they heal me in anyway other than the benefit I get mentally and physically by going out and gathering them in Nature, exercising as I collect and gather rocks and hike my dogs. That alone. That experience, the act of exploring, hunting, finding. Is so beneficial to my soul and mind. Then just being out in the woods here in Oregon and exploring the woods is the best type of therapeutic experience for me. It&#39;s like active meditation because even tho I am not sitting in one place - I am in a state of hyper awareness and I get in tune with my observation skills more and more each time I go exploring in the woods. There is just something magical about going on a walk in the wilderness by yourself and with your dog. Or, just by yourself if you don&#39;t have any dogs. The experience of hiking alone innately teaches you a lot, even if it&#39;s subconsciously. Nature is a amazing teacher, and you can learn how to be more connected to yourself, just by practicing going on solo hikes in the woods.

So all these sick and dying people were outside in their hospital beds.  Um, suddenly there was a major shift in the health of these people.  They were getting better, and significantly fewer dying.

The convention goes that the patient has to spend 110 hours inside the salt mines during the allergy season. This usually helps them through that season. I have observed this effect when my sister actually went through the treatment and at least during that period and for a couple of weeks after, her asthma wasn&#39;t as bad.

I have known this for quite a while, having worked in hospitality for over 20 years.  I remember when the ionic breeze was introduced, and I brought it to the attention of my boss at the time.  And she knew right away what it was, just as I did.   This is because there were already industrial versions of these machines on the market, catering to the hospitality industry.  If a guest were to be assigned a non-smoking room in any given hotel, and then break that rule, they would likely be charged a substantial fee, because the way hotels clean the room is with an ozone machine.   the ones we use do exactly what an ionic breeze does, only better.  it even sounds like a fan.  One of these units is placed in a room to be sterilized, turned on, and the room is then closed off for 2-3 days. No one would be allowed to rent, or stay in the room for an extended period, until the room had been properly vented.  A non-smoker would not then be able to tell that people had smoked in there, the room having been bombarded with ozone for a few days on end, and the process you mentioned in which the ozone attaches to the pollutants having taken place.  And yes, the offender would pay a fine equal to the cost of the hotel being unable to rent the room for those days.     The coolest part about all this is just how easy it is to make an ozone machine.   you don&#39;t have to buy an ionic breeze, or order one from a hotel supply catalog.   You can make one at home, using aluminum foil, sheets of glass(window panes work well), and a lamp cord.

Ozone we are  used to seeing generated in commutators of dc electric motors, (that smell of arcing), and in some welding processes. But Ozone (O3) is unstable and generates nascent oxygen. And nascent oxygen, a single atom of oxygen, is shortlived and converts to regular oxygen quickly.  In effect, two molecules of ozone would generate three molecules of oxygen.  So what&#39;s  wrong with that, if we get more pure oxygen around us.  Yes, breathing ozone directly could be harmful... they use Ozone as a &quot;bleaching&quot; agent in several products where ammonia or chlorine bleach could hazardous.

Our life source as we think of it is our ions. Our consciousness and memory is preserved within the overall cumulative reverberation/interactions that our ions have encountered. When we die, all that happens is we lose our magnetic polarity of our ions, causing our body to dye/change in hue on a light spectrum that we can\u2019t see with the naked eye. When we dye, our ions leave our bodies magnetic/gravitational field (our aura/our Ra/sun) and ascend upward as what we refer to as ghosts/spirits. The ions primarily get dispersed in the process while still maintaining their energy, but they can sometimes remain as a virtual mini sun in this natural physical process. They then will unite with the ionosphere or proceed to enter the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, leading to the aurora (our aura) borealis (bore E/energy all is). Then the ions continue on to emanate up out of the Earth in the form of lightning, heat or in the event that the ions remain gravitationally held in unison, as a ghost still (which can result in a partially lapsed recollection of our past lives, as the ions as a unit are able to maintain their memory/resonance). When we sleep, we are entering a meditative state in which we are able to temporarily send our ions away as a virtual sun. This is referred to as astral (Ah\u2019s [all of existence\u2019s] tour all) traveling. This allows the ions to collide with each other more effectively, which results in the duplication of ions. A single ion (existing on the smallest of scales), causes the sound of \u201cAh\u201d or \u264c\ufe0f which was the first sound of existence. You can picture this as the ion virtually traveling alone through time space. This still applies to the origin of existence despite there being no time space to travel within, because it technically had to occur before it\u2019s duplication into two ions, which causes a \u201cBah\u201d sound. You can picture this as two ions traveling (8) with each of their \u201cAh\u201d sounds still not being interfered with by any forces yet to exist. After \u201cBah\u201d came the animated effect of \u201cCaw\u201d, when life began. You can picture this as the first ion to enter into an orbit in the shape of a C. Once life began at \u201cCaw\u201d, a single ion duplicating effectively had timespace to emit a wave of energy within, which allows the sound of \u201cBOO\u201d. You can picture this as each ion emitting a ring of sound/energy. This is why ghosts are depicted as saying \u201cBOO\u201d.<br><br>I\u2019ll skip ahead 20,000 pages \ud83d\ude02 past the remainder of the 26 total sounds that formed in the beginning. Our alphabet fully mimics every sound and every shape, as well as how ions/electricity physically flow through every single letter, number and punctuation mark. This gives every letter of our alphabet a unique and very specific description of what energy functions are present in the formation of all words. This uniformity rooted in physics means that English is a common language (1 out of 7 total) that is spoken throughout the universe by advanced species. Hebrew is another of the 7 and I suspect I\u2019ll learn that Chinese is also once I look into it. If an alien species were to advance their technology enough to offer it\u2019s individuals a (surely expensive) opportunity to colonize on another planet, it would be highly beneficial to have such a remarkably simplified language in place. The motivation to have the upper hand against us silly 10% thinkers (via systematic poisoning, like wearing rubber soled shoes to interfere with our electrical conductivity and metal poisoning, etc) would mean their presence would need to be hidden to avoid the discovery of this Secret Doctrine. They hide among us VERY easily. Lol The more universal languages of the 7 total that are implemented on a planet, the greater the value of it\u2019s ticket price to live (or just visit) there, especially when some species are coming from a planet where they also had the doctrine hidden from their understanding or from planets that are suffering. \ud83d\ude23 But hey, it\u2019s 2020 somewhere. \ud83d\ude06 I suspect that Chinese is another of the 7 languages. With the understanding of merely 26 symbols/letters, one can practically walk straight into an understanding of the English language overnight, without the countless confusions that English would seem to present to the naked eye. Words that seem to be altered or inconsistent with the often unmentioned rules of the English language (like \u2018Octopus\u2019 vs \u2018Octopi\u2019, multiple \u2018Deer\u2019 remaining virtually singular, all words with an \u2018F\u2019 sound that we spell with a \u2018Ph\u2019, etc) are all based on these laws of physics and become quickly explained with an understanding of this easily teachable science. This is the Secret Doctrine. It\u2019s the blueprint for life as we know it. We as humans are left to essentially memorize words and memorize the spelling of each of those words. The definition of each letter is effectively obscured by the nature of the words that shouldn\u2019t exist in nature, which these definitions apply to in a different manner. The words that shouldn\u2019t technically exist are all merely comprised of a word or multiple words within itself as well as a single additional powering letter which ties the word/words together with the energy that it\u2019s single powering letter describes. This obstruction of our basic understandings is witchcraft/spelling, the craft of WHICH spelling. It is a subliminal manipulation/brainwashing of our most fundamental understandings of physics. The word association/mirroring techniques used in words that shouldn\u2019t exist are intended to prevent us from thinking of certain eye opening concepts. The energy flow through words can be displayed by writing positive and negative words on jars of rice. The jars with positive words (that technically should exist, based on the nature of existence\u2019s constant state) will keep the rice fresh longer. The negative energy words don\u2019t effectively absorb ions into the area, resulting in a greater likeliness of the protons and neutrons collapsing without the stability provided by the electron (the ion when it\u2019s in orbit).<br><br><br>The entire Bible is a book of spells. The Bible is where I started following these subliminal breadcrumbs of information, which rapidly lead me to full understandings of concepts that I might\u2019ve otherwise never been able to even grasp at...

I was born in Albuquerque, so fog was new to me.. seals barking.. and my dad threw the ball and the arc was as described.. whether I used sliding contiguous values or broke the time into separate increments.. and he dropped another ball at the same time.. both hit the ground at the same time.. far out man.. . so I have been thinking about chemistry for 64 years.   my brother was in bio medical engineering at UCSD.. and his group was one of two that figured out hardening of the arteries that eventually leads to myocardial infarction.. the leading cause of death among We the People.. when your heart stops, so does everything else.. but the spark of life remains.. unknown.. at least in western medicine.. the flow of energy through the body is called Qi in Chinese medicine.. it&#39;s tied up with the &quot;magic lipids&quot; my brother was looking for until his death in 93.. RIP Thomas.. I found them.. but .. it&#39;s unpublished information.. I have been sick.. and I had to figure out this stuff to get better.. it&#39;s very very pleasant to NOT hurt all the goddamned time.. and it is directly tied up with neurotransmitters and magic lipids.. it&#39;s not magic at all.. it&#39;s pretty simple chemistry and physics.. but if you don&#39;t know what makes our body work.. it&#39;s really just speculation.. and trying different things.. like cooking spaghetti.. throw a bit on the wall see if it sticks, kinda.. ;;\u2606\u300b.. I have been reading Dr Thomas E Carew&#39;s research after his initial research on hardening of the arteries etc.. that&#39;s exactly what he was doing.. using vitamin E..or C... and trying different lipids and fatty acids.. to prevent the buildup of scar tissue in the arterial walls....  I didn&#39;t know enough organic chemistry at first.. my focus has been physical chemistry and physics.. I was a computer programmer for Raytheon Engineers and Construtors.. as a hobby, sorta.. my occupation has always been physics, chemistry and geology.. I work to support my habit.. buy equipment and pay for field work.. I didn&#39;t need a better job.. so.. no degrees.. and not one branch of knowledge.. I read to find out new things.. read everything else on the search.. so.. I am pretty good at a bunch of different disciplines.. that&#39;s exactly why I am autodidactic ... it&#39;s way more fun.. and that&#39;s why I do it.. I am a fuggin hedonist.. ;;\u2606\u300b.. it&#39;s late.. I am going to bed.. not sick.. but easily tired.. it&#39;s been about 5 days.. I walked the 3rd day.. and it is finally over.. after 22 years.. good science allows accurate predictions about the real world.. the neurotransmitters that bridge the gap between nerve cells called the synapses are the foundation of Life itself.. they can be found in hempseed oil and blue poppy seeds.. gotta say blue.. the stuff in grocery stores is GMO.. with backwards proteins our body cannot see.. left hand instead of right hand.. or the reverse.. depending on how you look at it.. and each part of our body and brain has a full time, permanent pathway to and from the brain.. through the 4th opiod noceceptin.. noceceptin cells are the vaunted blood brain barrier.. and the receptors are located within the blood vessels where the nerves travel between body and brain.. the alkaloids utilize the alkalai metals in our blood to create the standing magnetic field.. cannabinoids send and opiods catch.. but what happens on one side of a magnet happens to the other at the same time.. this allows our brain to control the body in real time.. no light speed lag.. it bypasses A Einstein&#39;s assumption that simultaneous phenomenon are not possible.. north and south magnetic poles are the original entangled particles.. so we pull the finger from the hot stove before we burn.. because each pathway is permanent.. the staggered sending and receiving allows the same cells to carry both signals at the same time.. and the entire pathway is a single thing.. not dynamic.. and separate from all the others.. through the noceceptin cells.. now you know a little bit more about how our body works.. neurotransmitters are the foundation of Life itself", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T06:13:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hun Soulo", "comment_text": "You got sold an expensive lamp by a liberal hippie.", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T01:41:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "uncipaws", "comment_text": "Another pseudoscientific thing I frequently hear about is &quot;grounding&quot;: free electrons from the ground neutralize free radicals in your body?<br>I&#39;m skeptical.<br>I just enjoy walking barefoot on the earth to stimulate my sense of touch and as you say, fresh air and movement always help.", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T21:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Kosen", "comment_text": "We have a few salt lamps just because they look kind of pretty.

Now my question. What about the incredibly strong coulomb forces between charged particles? Wouldn&#39;t any negatively charged particle be associated with a positively charged particle nearby that would rapidly recombine with it?  I would think that the concentration of negative ions you quoted would be associated with an equal concentration of positively charged ions. Any concentration of charged particles would be the result of a steady state determined by the ambient production rate of ion pairs in competition with their very rapid recombination due to their extremely strong coulomb attraction. In the ionosphere, with densities low enough for satellites to orbit with little drag, the concentrations can be much higher than the atmospheric numbers you quoted, because oppositely charged particles are orbiting one another at distances too large to neutralize one another frequently. A volume of ionospheric space is essentially charge neutral. At atmospheric densities three body collisions are frequent, making it easy to allow oppositely charged particles to migrate to one another and either bond or exchange an electron, thereby removing themselves from the ion count.", "comment_date": "2020-03-19T02:29:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fatima Mohsin", "comment_text": "The best mood elevator is going out and enjoying sometime in the good old outdoors.", "comment_date": "2020-03-19T01:47:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abigail Porter", "comment_text": "Such an interesting video!

Ozone and ions. Ozone is not pollution. It is not smog. It is O3 - pure oxygen.\u00a0Ozone levels increase when pollutants increase. For example, when car exhaust fills the air, the sun&#39;s rays react with it to create ozone which in turn breaks down the pollutants to their basic, harmless elements. Since ozone levels increase with smog, misinformed persons assume the ozone is smog - that it comes out of the car exhausts. But that is impossible - internal combustion engines do not generate oxygen.\u00a0That ion expert exhibited an unreasonable fear over the smell of the ozone from the Ionic Breeze. Ozone is not poisonous. The ozone would actually disinfect the room and not harm anyone until it became strong enough to be objectionable. When it is too strong, you would have to breathe it for an hour or more before you would feel the irritation. That room was big enough he could have left that machine run for a few hours before the ozone level could become harmful. And even when it is &quot;harmful&quot;, it is only a mild irritant. Contrary to what a vacuum cleaner salesman once told me, ozone will not make your lungs explode. <br><br>Lightning creates lots of ozone. That&#39;s why it smells better after a lightning storm than after just rain. <br><br>If the ozone level is too high, it will irritate your throat and lungs. Ozone generating machines designed for constant use in the home can be set to &gt;.05 ppm to keep the inside of your house smelling fresh as outdoors without harming the occupants. Some machines have a sensor that automatically keeps the ozone levels safe. If your machine lacks such a feature, there&#39;s a technique for safely setting the machine. Turn on the machine and adjust it. Go away for an hour (shopping). The ozone level is set properly when you smell it for just a moment when you come inside.\u00a0It is also important to set the machine up high since ozone is heavier than air and will flow downward into the rest of the house. People usually put it on top of a bookcase on the top floor. Some machines are called &quot;blasters&quot;. They are designed to generate maximum ozone for destroying odors with a one-time treatment. They usually do not have the ability to be adjusted. Those should not be used in a living space except for when the area is free of personnel. This type of machine is used by real estate agents, used car dealerships, and hotel owners to get rid of odors from cigarettes, pets, and mold. <br><br>Ozone kills most but not all bacteria, and it kills odors by breaking down the stinky compounds. Ozone is currently being tested to see if it kills the Corona virus. It is known to kill similar viruses. There are thousands of stories of how problems were solved with ozone machines. A house was invaded by a skunk. Owner was told he needed to replace the sheetrock and flooring. Friend brought over his ozone machine. After &quot;blasting&quot; the house for two days, the odor was gone. My daughter bought a used car with a heavy dog odor. I left my small ozone machine running in it overnight. Dog odor was gone for a year until the following summer heat. One more treatment and it was permanently gone.  Hold a stinky dishrag in front of a ozone machine for 30 seconds and it will smell like it had been washed and hung outdoors to dry in the sun. Once a year, I turn my machine on high and run it through my central ventilation system to kill bacteria that might be growing in the ducting. <br><br>A relative just bought an ozone machine that connects to her washing machine. It is a second-generation design that works better than the first generation reviewed by Consumer Reports. She reports her laundry comes out clean and bright and odor-free using no detergent. I&#39;m ordering one as soon as she tells me which one it is. Ozone is used in some hot tubs instead of harmful chlorine. <br><br>Some machines include a negative ion generator. The ions helped clear the air of particles too small to be trapped by HEPA filters. Interestingly, there was a report some years ago, maybe on 20/20 or one of them, that said the more harmful air pollutants were those tiny particles that filters couldn&#39;t trap. <br><br>A local TV station, KIRO Channel 7 in Seattle, ran a hit piece on Alpine Air ozone machines many years ago. They got hold of an &quot;ozone expert&quot; and an Alpine machine, but did not read the instructions. They placed the machine in a bedroom on the nightstand facing where a person would be sleeping contrary to the instructions. The expert measured the ambient ozone level (zero), closed the bedroom door, and left the machine running all night long. The next day, they measured the ozone level. It was 0.05 ppm, the safe level. They didn&#39;t know the machine had a sensor to regulate the ozone level. The so-called expert said, &quot;Well that just shows if we left this in here another 8 hours, the ozone level would be too high!&quot; Idiot.", "comment_date": "2020-03-15T22:29:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IamCoalfoot", "comment_text": "&quot;And as an added bonus, you&#39;re guaranteed to get some fresh air&quot;<br>Not if you&#39;re walking around in a city.

The fact that the lamp produced no positive ions though, is pretty Amazing! Many lamps produce what they call &#39;dirty electricity&#39; or have improper conductivity so positive ions could stress people out, like working around an old router or god forbid, fluorescent lighting which majorly causes depression in time, for employees. So, anyway, the Himalayan Salt Lamp actually may be a healthy thing. Lava rock, quartz and tourmaline emit neg-ions but they are difficult to wear all the time, so some people use hologram-embedded stickers. I recommend Body Bionix, they have no positive ion projections and work differently than the neg ion bands on the market which project a whopping -1750 neg ions on a consistent basis (and they aren&#39;t &#39;radio active&#39; like a new popular video on reddit, claims.) . As for neg ions, they are actually the anti-oxidants of the air and they DO actually raise serotonin levels in the body. Notice how great you feel walking by the ocean? That&#39;s a concentration of neg ions, even your shower does that. I do all my creative thinking in the shower, which is a place that &#39;cools&#39; you down from EMF radiation or too many positive ions in the air around you from too many electronics in your life. When serotonin levels are raised, neg ions also oxygenate your body, which in turn, releases red blood cells that in turn relax and elongate muscles around your body. Some people report more flexability and core balance. Body builders that I have tested neg ion bracelets on, reported that they doubled their reps and routine at the gym. So, maybe there something to neutralizing EMF and positive ion radiation within 3 inches of your body, especially with the controversial 5G technology being added to cell towers in the future.

Since early 2000s, negative ion myth was so widespread in Korea, there were tons of products that generates some negative ions. Air purifier shown in the video was one prominent example, but the worst of them was &quot;negative-ion producing bed/pillows.&quot; It is difficult to even just imagine how on the earth a bunch of fabric could produce negative ions. But the most interesting part of this tragedy was that those beds indeed produced plentiful of negative-ions, since their interior was doped with RADIOACTIVE DUSTS THAT PRODUCES RADON GAS. I mean, seriously, we never thought those products REALLY emits ions, and since so much of the beds on market were marketed with these, we just didn&#39;t care. It has became to be known to public/government authorities last year. Around 100,000 beds were recalled and now sitting somewhere in Korea, waiting to be disposed of properly, and recently it became illegal to mention negative ion when advertising in Korea.

Most important thing in ionizer is whether it produces negative ions with carbon wire or with iron needle. Carbon wire is ONLY efficient method, with no side effects like ozon, what is NOT THE CASE with iron needle. This needle vibrates 200.000times per second and by doing that it ionizes air. BUT when needle gets old, after a few months even, it starts to corrode. And corroded needle produces 100x higher levels of unwanted ozon O3 levels, as scientist detected in the lab. Again, ionizers with carbon wire are the only-one to buy. Just for remark, every operation room in hospitals uses that kind of ionizers+UV light to sterilize the air 99,99%.

I appreciate the information.  It was very interesting.  However, some of these experiments seem a bit off to me.  They just don\u2019t seem to go far enough, only extrapolating surface information.  For example, if you wiped water on the salt of the lamp (not the electrical components obviously, just the salt) ever so often to keep it damp, would it then create negative ions?  What about rain?  Is there an inordinate amount of negative ions in something like a rain storm that has no lightning or even in a light rain shower?  How about a shower in a bathroom?  What about fog?  If so in fog, does a fog machine that once was used, say back in the day in dance clubs, create negative ions?  Shouldn\u2019t experiments be done, then, on people regarding being in these situations, not letting them know what the experiment is about but that it\u2019s just not harmful, in order to get better info on whether negative ions are actually beneficial?  This video on this subject matter just reminds me of an artist\u2019s common mistake:  Often an artist thinks s/he needs not to overwork a piece and stops before any of the detail work would actually make it a masterpiece.  Just my take is all.  But this is my normal complaint about science today:  Science is often used to \u201cdebunk\u201d crack theories yet comes across just as crack because the real science is skewed in order to get across a political or personal view.  I know I\u2019m not the only one, which is why so many people are outright rebelling against science now as it seems to have become the religion of the elites in power to further oppress the masses.  Just sayin\u2019.  So I conclude with saying that, if you want to get to the general populace who do in reality have minds of their own, you might want to do more work to better illuminate your findings; otherwise, you may just be alienating more people from ever wanting to have anything to do with science and thus people like you.", "comment_date": "2019-07-29T18:18:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brenda Penny", "comment_text": "Well it&#39;s a good thing I think my salt lamp is pretty and that was all I bought it for!

The goal was to ionize the air in my lungs, and kill germs on my skin. As long as I didn&#39;t touch anything else conductive while the wire was attached, I wouldn&#39;t get shocked. My finding was that this caused me to start coughing a lot.<br>I decided to stop doing that, and so I attached the wire to a sheet of aluminum foil that I taped to my door. This kept my roommates from barging in on me (because the doorknob would shock them) and it gave them an entertaining method of delivering my mail, which was to fling it at my door and let it stick to the statically charged wood.<br>For whatever reason, I decided to use the electric arc from the door-capacitor to zap a small mole on my arm to see if it would make the mole go away. It did make the mole go away, but it was replaced by a scar. <br><br>I then moved on to attach the wire to a piece of aluminum window screen that was over the surface of a 20&quot;x20&quot; furnace filter that was taped to the intake of a similarly sized box fan. The static charge caused a very fine powder (presumably from tiny particles in the air) to build up on the filter. I assume the charge enhanced the effectiveness of the filter, but periodically, there were discharges from the screen to the metal frame of the box fan. When my computer (approximately 15 feet and one internal wall away from the unit) started randomly locking up, I went to a command prompt to see what was going on. I saw random characters showing up, as if they were being typed. I thought I had been hacked, but I noticed the faint sound of a &#39;snap&#39; every time the characters appeared. Evidently, the discharge was causing interference in my computer.<br><br><br>There&#39;s my experience with electrical ionizers. If you were curious about these things, I don&#39;t suggest repeating the experiments involving electrifying yourself or zapping moles. Electrifying your doorknob is always a good idea though. It keeps out people who are too daft to touch the knob with a metal object first to discharge it, and/or are too wimpy to discharge it with an area of skin that is not a finger.", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T18:57:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jade Stephan", "comment_text": "ooh, I want the jacket he has at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ--scjcAZ4&amp;t=2m03s\">2:03</a>", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T18:55:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jale soylugil", "comment_text": "sunlight", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T18:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Savy Garg", "comment_text": "Is it because tourmaline are expensive?<br>Old guy: .... can i go back now?now i understand why they send him to me whenever he visits us", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T18:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dtiydr", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ--scjcAZ4&amp;t=8m51s\">8:51</a> &quot;So your conclusion after testing this device is that the equipment is faulty?&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T17:58:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "dtiydr", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ--scjcAZ4&amp;t=3m29s\">3:29</a> Ok, I would not have thought that.", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T17:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PurpleBubbles", "comment_text": "where is he walking?", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T17:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Metaldetecting Tube and Tech", "comment_text": "Nice video , but wich camera did you use whilest vlogging ?<br>Great stable quality footage \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T11:42:40Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Gary Ha", "comment_text": "There must be a bunch of intelligent people here, so you&#39;ll find this interesting:<br>Ozone produced by an ultraviolet light (around 254nm if I recall) is fairly pure at making 3-atom oxygen molecules out of 2-atom.

And those single N&#39;s then recombine in strings of varying numbers, and when they combine with water (like in your lungs) form nitric acid.

I was told that high voltage (like lightening) strikes the oxygen molecule O2 with enough force to split some of them apart.

As a lifelong researcher, I was saving up some methodological comments to share, then you dropped that point, and I felt like cheering.  You nailed it.  The known unequivocal paths to a better emotional life are very available to embrace; we just have to actively chose to make the effort on-goingly.  Move around.  Share positive social moments.  Sleep enough, well, and regularly.  Eat real food.  Avoid or at least limit crutches that disorient our feedback loops, like drugs, alcohol, and stimulants.  Practice releasing anxiety regularly.  And engage earnestly in reframing our mental outlooks especially when we are least content.<br><br>Okay, two research method notes:<br><br>(1) Could anions have some catalytic &amp;/or bio-cascade impact disproportionate to their tiny concentrations?  Maybe.  My industry (specialty chemicals) is super aware of the toxins that harm folks at ppm or even sometimes ppb levels.  That&#39;s always baffled intuition, for me.  How can 50 mg Vanadium per cubic meter of air be harmful?  Or 2 ppm of H2S?  But bio data proves it is.  Clearly, tiny amounts of Some things can have big effects.  Granted, that statement falls way short of a mechanistic hypothesis for anion benefits.  But it does counter your video&#39;s claim that rarefied concentrations alone might justify discounting any possible impact.<br><br>(2) The frustrating sparsity of dosing controls in the majority of experiments actually strengthens the possibility that the anions might be beneficial.  (Not your implication of the other way &#39;round.)  Any individual study that is correctly run in every other respect, but which under-dosed subjects, <i>should</i> find little-or-no benefit.  So only those studies that gave consistent, sufficient doses actually allow us to assess the hypothesis of anions benefits.  At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ--scjcAZ4&amp;t=6m47s\">6:47</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ--scjcAZ4&amp;t=7m11s\">7:11</a>, you cite studies reporting benefits at high concentrations of anions.  Were those perhaps from a small subset of studies that used consistent high levels of anions?  I am Not saying I necessarily believe so; only that the correct path to an answer follows the above logic.<br><br>Regardless, great video.  The use of the GC-mass spec really proves the salt lamps are just pretty placebos (fine as long as that&#39;s all you&#39;re expecting).  And the ozone measurement nipped in the bud any nascent musing I had of ordering up a ionizer from Amazon.  But I am still wondering if there might be a synthetic path to making cheap tourmaline.  (A too-quick Google found a Russian website that could easily be a scam, and it doesn&#39;t claim it&#39;s cheap.)  Perhaps there exists some composition (in a possibly extended family of tourmaline-like compounds) that optimizes ion formation, without necessarily making clear crystals for jewelry, which might therefore be easier/cheaper to synthesize.", "comment_date": "2019-02-19T04:33:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I\u2019m only in it for the parking", "comment_text": "What about a high pressure waterfall that could fit in a house?

But for someone making videos like this one, it is worth further investigating, I would say and making maybe another video....

He admits to only looking at a fraction of the studies available and selects only those with imperfect methodology to take issue with. The video  also suffers from straw men arguments by wasting time talking about ridiculous salt lamps that are obvious frauds with absurd claims. Then he brings what looks like a well worn, old Ionic Breeze from 30 years ago he got off Ebay for $10 which has likely seen it&#39;s electronics degraded to  the point that it would produce harmful amounts of Ozone  even with the metal plates removed. The technology has improved logarithmically in the years since this device was taken off the market. A simple web search shows a unit capable of over 200 million negative ions per cubic centimeter as measured one foot from the source or many trillions at the source with zero Ozone or positive ions produced.

The thing is that all over the place people says that is possible to change that ph by the food you eat and water you drink but with a little search on google you can find that the main mechanism that control the blood ph is the breading through the concentration of oxygen which elevates the ph. Higher concentration of oxigen increasing the ph of blood is congruent with the idea of high ph being good for you. And in that regard There&#39;s the case of the Wim Hof Methot that claims to have health benefits to increase the concentration of oxygen on the blood and therefore the ph.

For the first 1/2 - 2/3rds of the video, you seem to be implying that there is a scientific basis for negative ions having a real effect on a person. You cite results from multiple papers to make it seem credible without discussing any of the flaws of the papers, to the point that I was even beginning to think you genuinely believed there was a real effect (I nearly closed the video and went to go look up some papers myself, because I genuinely could not believe this was a real thing -- and luckily you saved me quite a lot of time by raising/discussing many of the issues I was contemplating) -- it&#39;s only much later in the video that you quite suddenly shift in tone and discuss the flaws in the papers and essentially show that this is all bunk. But for many viewers, the subtleties and importance of methodologies,  blinding participants and researchers, sample sizes and statistical significance may be lost on them. Not to mention, they may not watch the entire video, and I have no doubt that people with an agenda will clip out portions of this video to suit their needs and piggyback on your name and reputation as someone of good standing among the science-literate to further said agenda. Quite frankly, if I saw only the first 1/2 - 2/3rds of this video, I would&#39;ve been extremely shocked and surprised, not to mention extremely confused -- and I consider myself quite scientifically literate and a healthy skeptic. For many other viewers, I can&#39;t help but think that they will ignore the latter part of the video and the first half will only reinforce previously held beliefs/positions that there genuinely is a real effect -- not to mention it&#39;s likely to confuse many others. And it&#39;s not that I mind that you investigated something most would dismiss out of hand as pseudoscience to begin with -- quite to the contrary, I think it&#39;s good to do these sorts of videos, to show that a responsible scientist can and should impartially investigate ideas they may already have had a negative or positive bias toward. The problem I have is the way you discussed and presented the material -- maybe I&#39;m overreacting, but I genuinely think you did the larger scientific community (which is constantly having to fight a never ending war against ignorance, pseudoscience and the like) a serious disservice by not being much more up front about the obvious flaws in the papers/research you looked at and discussing those from the beginning. If you want to point out that there were some interesting results that warranted more research, by all means -- but you should have been much more adamant in putting to rest any notion that negative ions have any real effect, in my opinion.

She&#39;s very much into that sort of thing but looking at it I start thinking about &quot;okay where are the negative ions supposedly coming from?&quot; One hypothesis is that it&#39;s acting as a sort of Optical capacitor. University of Michigan has done some research into this field where wavelengths of Light May induce semi conductive material that is translucent in order to deposit charge on surfaces. Could this be happening naturally within the structure of salt? No idea but I&#39;m pretty sure the tiny wattage white likely does not produce much of any ions. Unlikely any natural light would be a greater candidate if that hypothesis was true. Does the EMF likely matters to the geometry of any set structure such as a rock salt lamp. <br>Negative ions do seem like they would have at least an interaction with the human body as charged is likely necessary that we may take for granted in most chemical reactions. In that we just assumed that there is enough charge density in any given location for electrons to be shared in chemical compositions. So along those lines negative ions May assist with a natural chemistry at the body and thus leading to different positive effects. However it may not be true if different amount of charge may have ill effects or undesired consequences. I think it&#39;s a field that needs more exploration and to bring it home into mainstream science.", "comment_date": "2019-02-06T19:52:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohawkma Gandhi", "comment_text": "I think this is all kind of ionic, after watching the video maybe I should try being more negative than positive \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2019-02-06T19:52:07Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "David", "comment_text": "40views 155 likes...
