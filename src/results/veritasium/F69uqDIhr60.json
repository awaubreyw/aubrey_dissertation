And you&#39;re on a Shark/Tourism trip, where Sharks get fed. While in Proximity to People. To ships. To swimmers/Divers (even if in a cage). I haven&#39;t seen one yet, but I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve got a vid about Pavlov?<br>Australia is infamous with shark fans about shark attacks, shark hunts and shark feeding, and all of this ties together for some part. <br>For those uninformed: Feeding sharks attracts more sharks. It teaches them that People=Food (not are, but get associated with). So they will search out people. They will stay closer to the coast. This is a problem. And with this video, you are further propagating this behaviour and also maybe spreading the will to do something similar with other people.

Essentially, by preventing competitive exclusion, sharks stimulate more balance of food chain energy transfers through allowing greater diversity. In other words, if people didn&#39;t overhunt sharks, sharks would be allowed to regulate the populations of all the other lower trophic level species of the food chain better. No one can replace shark biological roles better than sharks because they&#39;re immersed their entire lives. Nature controls homeostasis, not the money-driven overhunting fisheries&#39; maximal sustainable yield mumbo jumbo. And by maintaining marine ecosystems&#39; diversity, we&#39;d also allow the biological magnification of toxins, like mercury, to taper at a steadier rate rather than a slow rate with less diversity.
