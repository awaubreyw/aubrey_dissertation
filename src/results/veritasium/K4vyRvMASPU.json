Much has been written about the concept of \u201cflow\u201d wherein a person engages in an activity that is almost \u201cmindless\u201d. Surfing, playing improvised music and even certain video games can allow a person to achieve this mindless experience where time itself seems to dissolve away and the observer can only recall a feeling they often have difficulty in communicating afterwards with language.

I wish that in this one you had covered the fact that there is no such thing as &#39;now&#39;. All you have to do is ask the simple question: how long is &#39;now&#39;? Because of the infinite nature of numbers, there can be no answer. Is &#39;now&#39; a thousandth of a second? A millionth? A billionth? A billion billionth? It is like the classic problem of two objects never being able to touch. This is one of my most favorite subjects, and I think about it all the &#39;time&#39;. Because time itself is an illusion. Since there is no such thing as &#39;now&#39;, there can be no such thing as &#39;time&#39;. All that mankind has managed to do about the apparent existence of time is to get clocks all moving together, or more or less together, which is very convenient for when you want to meet somebody etc. But time is like gravity: an assumption with no basis in actual reality. What there is, is DURATION. Things continue in the same state - or give the illusion of continuing in the same state - and this gives the impression of something called &#39;time&#39;. Even duration is an illusion because nothing in atomic reality ever stays exactly the same. But anyway, I believe that an extraordinary state of enlightenment is possible the moment you perceive that you cannot live &#39;in the moment&#39; because the &#39;moment&#39; is ever escaping into the infinity of numbers.

I redid it multiple times, then tried it staring at the spot where he shows it to appear, then tried it pause-play frame by frame. I couldn\u2019t see it and checked comments, and saw people say they did. So then went and tried it at 0.25x, also tried following the circle, and frame by frame at the reduced speed, and am staring at the video paused at the spot and time in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4vyRvMASPU&amp;t=4m05s\">4:05</a> where it supposedly appears. Probably an editing mistake, and those claiming they see it are bluffing.<br><br>Edit:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4vyRvMASPU&amp;t=4m25s\">4:25</a> Ah... didn\u2019t think he\u2019d do it more, and was watching in 1.25x this time. Trying to make up lost time. But had to stop and update comment about this...<br><br>So this time I saw it every time it circled. First 2 looked normal, flash appeared in ring, ring moving at the same rate. Not surprising, given I can\u2019t really see optical illusions. I\u2019m not really sure this counts as an optical illusion though, because an optical illusion is an image telling a typical brain to do unusual things, while this is just pointing out a weird thing typical brains naturally do. So the tait(s) for these things are not necessarily codependent / related to the same gene.<br><br>When I\u2019m trying to not miss something; like when I\u2019m watching Veritasium; I\u2019m replaying what I\u2019m seeing in my head simultaneously so that I\u2018m half as likely to miss something. I didn\u2019t feel like anything unexpected happened in real time on the 3rd time around, but in my memory instant replay the ring was 1/8 down from the 9 o\u2019clock spot (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4vyRvMASPU&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a> o\u2019clock) when I saw the flash, but the ring instantly teleported to be around the flash at the exact moment of flash, then it continued around from there. So I still saw the flash perfectly in the ring, and it happened so fast I chocked it up to misremembering (specifically; recalling out of order) rather than seeing wrong. I cold have found out for sure by just replaying the memory again, but I preferred to just keep watching in that moment. <br><br>The 4th time was undeniably crazy though. The ring was at 8 o\u2019clock at the flash, but this time I saw the ring and the flash alone not touching for an instant, then the ring teleported to 10 o\u2019clock still not touching the flash for an instant, then to 9 o\u2019clock where it perfectly encompassed the flash. It was so fast that after the real time viewing I thought I might have seen 3 rings at once. But I slowed down the replay (and paused the video so the sync wouldn\u2019t be off) and saw it appear like that. Then played it in reverse to rewatch the 3rd cycle, and it played out like in the first memory replay.<br><br>Edit 2: <br>His conclusion makes sense. Some peoples subconscious are probably just better or faster at interpreting the moment. Given enough cycles of the same thing my brain probably started getting lazy and assuming, and then it happened. And when my subconscious realized it made a mistake in showing the ring position relative to the flash too low it displayed it higher but over compensated the position offset by double before getting it right.", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T06:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vickie Sanders", "comment_text": "Han shot first", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T00:18:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "absolutelybagel", "comment_text": "You&#39;re like vSauce but still post", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T15:33:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Geni B", "comment_text": "Life is a simulation and the specious present is a frame in the update loop...", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T03:38:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajat Paul Minj", "comment_text": "For those who didn&#39;t see the flash at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4vyRvMASPU&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> ...

Many people have experienced time slowing down when they have been in high intensity moments and I often find that it is when people have a good understanding of the physics of what is happening to them.

My brain is adjusting and sometimes it makes me hit wrong spot, because aiming system is usually shown as 2 circles - one is showing me where I aim with mouse, second is correcting for mechanics in game and telling me when and where my weapon can hit. It is funny to mess with it, because when you switch machines you are missing even if you see you hit perfectly where you wanted to! (Funny thing, I always felt something is wrong and I waited patiently repeating until I adjusted). And different fighters react so differently on your steering that you lose your ability to aim one when flying another. I wonder furthermore if that phenomena is somehow connected to our motoric skills and ability to drive reversed steering bike, as presented by Destin from Smarter Every Day.

When the brain is processing information. It is often processing it in ways that are for the best part, conserving. Like a computer, the brain does not have truly unlimited storage. Granted, it has a lot, but not unlimited. As such, much of what we experience through our senses is identified and organized to integrate this factor. When we see something that is even remotely repetitive, our own brain is organizing the information as it comes to us in such a way that, it is hypothesizing that the action will behave as expected even if we consciously are expecting otherwise. <br><br>A line that is going across the screen will be assumed to continue to go across the screen. Consciously we may be thinking, &quot;ok, it&#39;s going to stop or something&quot;, but our brains internal processes are already working on it continuing. Additionally, most of us grow up not being attuned to consciously taking note of a subtle or minor deviation to the expected. As children we might, but as adults, our brain has seen enough that it can now build its own hypothesis as to what is coming. Even if something is  moving forward yet moving all over the place (squiggle), the brain is still evaluating it such that, it expects the object to continue to move forward. <br><br>This to me is also due to the fact that we follow the laws of physics in everyday life and as such, mentally expect the results we often see. A ball falls, we expect it to fall to the ground, not stop half way and then go up like a Yoyo. As such, our own brain may very well finish that decent and ascent with only a possibility of noticing it did not go all the way down due to a lack of sound. Because of natural expectation, if the ball were to fall part of the way yet emit a sound as if it hit the ground and then come up. The person would very likely not notice it did not go all the way down and instead, assume it was just quicker than expected in its return. The reality is, our brains are trying to save room and, as such, memories, thoughts and events are calculated and evaluated in search of saving that space. A change in the environment means more processing time, more processing power, more memory, etc. A fraction of a second of sound vs visual input in many cases does not give the brain a need to process more. Noticing something out of the center of ones vision contributes to a similar effect. <br><br>In the end, its all about conservation of resources. After all, when we get old, who knows how much stuff we WON&#39;T remember.

So you need to delay that choice, and look ahead in the text, to find that future information you need. That&#39;s sort of what our brains are doing here, right?

But then, I use to some video editing so I&#39;m always careful about things like that.  Also, wireless controller for things like smash bros. has a slight delay that really gets to me. But I think all this might be missing a larger point. Try this experiment if you&#39;re near sighted. Play a FPS or a racing game on a big screen a good distance away so things are just slightly blurry (my game of choice was splatoon and mario kart) and measure your reaction time. Now do it with your glasses on. If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ll see that your reaction is slowed. But it&#39;s because you&#39;re spending more time trying to figure out what is what/where. In computer programming, there&#39;s a whole field of study about image recognition and in it, we find that to do things like recognizing things in a flat image is hard and very work intensive. We often think this is easy because the human brain doesn&#39;t even need to stop and look at every pixel to recognize a certain object. But the truth is, we do. We just do it very quickly. But as the image gets more fuzzy or noisy, you&#39;ll find that computer image recognition, and our own, takes longer. This is the same for figuring out things like sound synching between audio and video. While we&#39;re looking at an image and processing it, there&#39;s a gap of time where we&#39;re spending analyzing the image and not seeing the next image. Now, that&#39;s not to say we can&#39;t mess with our own internal clocks through training or conditioning, but this is, in my experience with animation, a better explanation than our brains trying to expect something. This explanation would also explain things like how humans can miss the forest for the trees when someone focuses on 1 aspect of a sight and miss things going around it. <br><br>Oh, and although some people don&#39;t notice it consciously, they do notice it consciously. When the sound of a video or animation lags by a few milliseconds, although a person might not notice that that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, they&#39;ll generally feel that the same video/animation is moving &quot;at a slower pace&quot; (as in the pacing of a story or the film as a whole.) than one that&#39;s synched up.", "comment_date": "2016-02-25T19:00:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pavel Totzauer", "comment_text": "why i saw something very similiar on vsauce? ..", "comment_date": "2016-02-25T18:59:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Branko Dimitrijevic", "comment_text": "I dont know do you believe me but I saw it in the middle, and I did notice the delay of the ball when he presses space...", "comment_date": "2016-02-25T18:58:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "World Of Automotive!", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t notice.", "comment_date": "2016-02-25T18:54:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas", "comment_text": "i was using this to my advantage ehile editing a music video we shot for school yesterday", "comment_date": "2016-02-25T18:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fifimajster", "comment_text": "Sometimes when I&#39;m high I feel that my specious present lasts for about 3 seconds instead of 0.1.

There are too many variables. It is important to note if the key is of a mechanical keyboard or mesh/electronic keyboard. It looks like you start the time as soon as the key begins to be pushed, which makes me think that it is a mechanical keyboard. Most people are used to mesh keyboards which requires someone to push the key virtually all the way down to read that the key has been pressed. Also people often preceive a full press of a button as a push AND release. Therefore, they are associating the press as when they push and release the key, that amount of time takes nearly a tenth of a second which essentially makes it seem completely synconized to them with the full press and release. When you make the green light comes up instantly (which i assume as been program to appear on the down press), they feel that the green light comes up before the press becuase 1. they are not likely used to a mechanical keyboard, which registers an input with much less depression. 2) they are likely assuming that a press is a full press AND release.

It can be caused by the refresh rate of the retina. we all know that when we see a flash of light, it takes few milliseconds for it to be erased from sight.
