The back plane of the film, dependant on the n- index number is responsible for amplifying the light. If the back plane of the film is close to one then there will be less light bounce. Also the n- index is responsible for the angle of refraction, exiting the film. <br>The holes are 1/4- lambda apart, causing amplification of the harmonic multiple of the fundamental node- 1/4xlambda x N, Where N =&gt; infinity as the amplitude goes to zero( basically 2- colours are amplified together)- producing a different color. <br>The angle of color view is caused be n 1x Sin( theta)= n2 x sin( Theta2). Air has an n value of 1 and glass has the value of 1.5, so you can use this to determine the width of those holes separation by the two amplified colors hitting your eye. <br>In all , Polaroid work in the similar way except the thickness is 1/2 x lambda", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T07:42:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Subha ch", "comment_text": "Me watching this after 8 years.Thanks yt algorithm.", "comment_date": "2021-07-20T16:59:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Marcos Antonio Streit", "comment_text": "Was&#39;nt Bobby Fischer?", "comment_date": "2021-07-14T00:30:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Crosby", "comment_text": "&quot;How To Make Color* With Holes&quot; &quot;Tell me what to eat.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T06:30:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bukachell", "comment_text": "Indeed australian notes did get this feature", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T07:36:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pola & Tiger", "comment_text": "Next vid: How to make money with nothing?", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T08:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Runner Go", "comment_text": "It still blows my mind that EMF is light, magnets. and electricity (even lightning) all together as the same force.
