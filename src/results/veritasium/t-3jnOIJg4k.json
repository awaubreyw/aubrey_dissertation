While there are a ton of breaking pitches and even more ways to blur the lines between all of them, the curveball is generally meant to mean a pitch that breaks from 12-6. It is thrown by providing top spin and making the laces tumble consecutively. As proven by a ton of other ball mechanics, top spin provides more drop off in trajectory. The pitches shown and discussed in this video are more akin to sliders. This difference is the reason why curveballs are what ruin pitchers rotator cuffs more so than any other pitch. To produce the top spin, you align your index and middle fingers on a single seam and as you throw the ball, you turn your wrist sideways and yank downwards. Very few curveballs have perfect top spin and are usually rotating at an angle.

As such, here are some corrections:<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-3jnOIJg4k&amp;t=2m06s\">2:06</a>: A curveball doesn&#39;t usually spin on a vertical axis. Though every pitcher is a little different, the term &quot;curveball&quot; refers to pitches that have some degree of topspin. So, with some variation, the axis is horizontal, and because they have topspin, they fall faster than gravity pulls them. They also move in varying degrees to the pitcher&#39;s glove side, so to the left if thrown by a right-handed pitcher. A curveball that moves to the pitcher&#39;s arm-side is called a &quot;screwball&quot;. I think they are called &quot;curveballs&quot; because their movement is most noticeable, because their movement is consistent with gravity. The fastball, on the other hand, resists gravity, due to backspin.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-3jnOIJg4k&amp;t=2m33s\">2:33</a> In major-league baseball at least, they put a new ball in play if virtually anything touches the ball, other than the pitcher and catcher.
