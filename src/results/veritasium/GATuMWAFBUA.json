They asked me what I wanted to talk about and I said &#39;how electric cars are the future.&#39; They gave me total control over the script and video and didn&#39;t ask me to change a thing.\u00a0Personally I didn&#39;t think this video was too branded because it&#39;s about electric cars in general. I drive an electric car and I like it a lot.<br><br>I see a lot of the comments concerned that I didn&#39;t talk about the negatives of electric cars. That&#39;s because this video is about why electric cars are the future, not &#39;why electric cars have some challenges to overcome&#39;. Some people interpret the lack of negatives like I was only allowed to say positive things. That&#39;s not true.<br><br>Obviously in hindsight I should have talked about:\u00a0<br>Electric cars are still expensive - sure but as I noted battery costs are coming way down and they&#39;re cheaper to run<br><br>Electric cars produce more CO2 to manufacture than gas cars - but they compensate within 1-5 years by being more efficient and producing less to run<br><br>Lithium mining isn&#39;t great for the environment - true but no mining is great for the environment (it takes a lot to make any car) and we can recycle the batteries a lot more cheaply than going back to mining the raw material. New battery designs are also reducing the amount of rare metals required.<br><br>For long road trips you do need to take pit stops around charging stations.<br><br>If you&#39;re thinking about people charging at night, how does that affect the electricity grid? I personally think it&#39;s a good thing because it evens out demand, which is usually highest during the day.<br><br>Hydrogen fuel cell cars - this is just something I personally don&#39;t see happening because there&#39;s not enough existing infrastructure. Electricity is everywhere, easily charge at your house. Hydrogen is not. When I was graduating college in 2004 hydrogen fuel cell cars were meant to be right around the corner.

There is an estimate of 14 million tons of Lithium on the planet. Each Tesla car needs 63kg of Lithium which gives us a total of 233 333 000 possible Tesla cars if we don\u2019t produce any other battery, cellphone, or computer.\r<br>OK. Hopefully, there will be new types of batteries, so we solve the Lithium problem.\r<br>If Mexico would change 50M combustion cars to 50M electric ones, the amount of energy to charge those cars would be above 1TW a day. Taking into account that the Mexican nuclear plant Laguna Verde produces 4.6TW per year, we come to a number that we need at least 300 nuclear plans of that type to charge the cars. The amount of energy that is needed is incredible. \r<br>Ok, you say solar. The number of solar panels you would need to produce that amount is 5 000 000 000 solar panels. In square kilometers is 5000km2 so half of the state Durango. \r<br>Ok, let\u2019s say it is doable somehow and we actually create 5B solar panels, that require a big number of workers to clean and repair them. Hey, it is a big surface, a lot of panels don\u2019t work all the time, you know Sun is not peaking 24h a day and they have a life span of a few years. A lot of garbage later for sure.\r<br>And you can charge the car only during the day, as this energy can\u2019t be stored. Imagine a battery for 1TW.....\r<br>Ok panels are all set so we need to distribute that energy around. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t run 1000A current through a 2cm thick cable. So, to run 125A current you need 8mm thick wire. And there must be two of them. \r<br>The biggest problem of all this EV craziness is delivering the energy. Just 10 EVs in your neighborhood require big transformers, like really big ones, and the wires to your house have to be thick. They are made of copper, and copper is expensive, and you need a lot. The amount of copper and aluminum needed to distribute the energy throughout Mexico is just impossible to get and to pay. The numbers must be in trillions of dollars. Just some incredibly high number that no country can pay, install\u2026. And the energy to make that, uf\u2026\r<br>We won\u2019t see in 20 years that we all drive EVs. We won\u2019t. Period. Wishful thinking is one thing but physics and mathematics are another. You can\u2019t cheat nature.\r<br>I hope someone finds some better ways.

Also: ICE cars have many gears giving them multiplication of torque. So many people don&#39;t understand the basics of automotive technology.<br>2: They have a lower centre of mass, which btw also raises the passenger position so when loaded up that decreases. But that lower centre of mass comes with the price of no or very low flexibility in placing that mass, horrible passenger comfort as the floor is raised and car manufacturers for some reason do not compensate for that lift by also lifting the seat height, forcing passengers to sit almost as if sitting on the floor! Terribly uncomfortable.<br>3: Hardly any electric cars have separate motors for separate wheels. Almost all of them are driven through a differential just like ICE cars. Also, ICE cars have limited slip diffs with electronic control which can do torque vectoring.<br>4: Electric cars are not quieter. Even very inexpensive cars like BMW&#39;s 1-series have incredibly quiet engines, let alone more expensive ones. You can&#39;t hear the engine. Auto Motor und Sport tested the whole BMW X3 range including the fully electric iX3, and the iX3 was NOT the quietest of them all. Also, for example BMW&#39;s i3 is incredibly much louder than the far cheaper 1-series even of the previous model generation.<br>5: At least in Europe that is not universally true, for sure soon not necessarily in the USA either. Actually due to cheap gas in the USA that&#39;s probably not true now either. Public charging is incredibly expensive compared to pure electricity cost in theory, they charge a lot for that. And you pay for those incredibly, astoundingly expensive chargers through your taxes. Last charger project I checked out in the USA had the official statement of costing taxpayers over $70.000 for one 40kW (so not even very fast) charger! For the home you need to have a charger installed and those costing, including installation thousands means that you&#39;ll fill up your ICE car with pretty much gas after keeping that money in stocks for a couple of years. And with the government forcing EVs upon us will skyrocket the demand for electricity and therefore the price will also skyrocket.\u00a0<br>EVs also consume a lot more than the manufacturers and blogger lie to you about their consumption. Especially if you live in a climate which has a winter your consumption can easily double or a lot more, and the costs go up with that. The reported consumption is not what you pay for in electricity, as they have dishonestly left out all the electricity they use in charging losses (reportedly around 10% minimum and can skyrocket especially in fast charging and if the battery is not at optimum temp), preconditioning the battery (=heating that massive lump of metal), preheating the cabin, and also heating the cabin while driving. They also leave out how if you stop, then the car gets cold again, no matter if you stopped for just one hour you&#39;ll still have to heat up the cabin again and the battery of course especially before charging... And heating up the cabin with electricity is horribly wasteful. <br>So no, you won&#39;t necessarily save at all compared to ICE and and pay more!<br>6: That is just purely wrong. Charging losses, keeping the battery at temp, preheating it for charging, heating the cabin with electricity = wasteful.<br>7: You can also fuel up a CNG car at home... And you can only charge a car at home if you have your own parking place or garage and you have paid for the installation of a charger.<br>8: Completely meaningless propaganda. All of the 6 last cars I&#39;ve owned only need servicing every 2 years. And that one service every 2 years is no chore. All I have to do is go to the dealership and leave the keys and take their loaner car, or alternatively I have a coffee, read the papers and do some work in their waiting area for about 1,5 hours. That&#39;s every 2 years. And guess how often I have to take my EV to be serviced: also every 2 years! Less service items then of course, but a half hour service time difference every 2 years is meaningless. BTW PHEVs also have regenerative braking.<br>9: Absolutely false. EVs do contribute to climate change. Only in your extreme case of using your own solar panels to charge a very small-battery EV is there even a meaningful difference in CO2 emissions. First of all even solar panels cause CO2 emissions, and they are problematic waste. But as I said, that is the best case scenario, and in every EV scenario, especially with most EVs with big batteries the CO2 emissions in their production is horrific. Then their electricity production also causes CO2 and other pollution. Sometimes less, sometimes more, but the end difference is marginal compared to ICE cars, on average of course since there are so many variables. Due to the massive CO2 emissions in EV production they are worse for the environment compared to practically any and all ICE cars that are driven less than average amount of miles per year. Especially big battery EVs.<br>ICE cars on the other hand are not too bad compared to EVs even now, on average I&#39;d estimate at worst only 20% more emissions (so absolutely not worth the trillions of cost coming from pushing the world into EVs), but above all they can be run on biofuels and e-fuels and then they are absolutely and completely cleaner than EVs. They absolutely kill the EVs on how low their emission are then. There are really many ICE cars running right now on biomethane, next gets biodiesel (NEXBTL) made from waste etc. which are in a completely different league in cleanliness compared to EVs. In many cases they can even be estimated to be NEGATIVE in greenhouse gas emission as they decrease methane emissions which is a multiple times stronger greenhouse gas than CO2. And e-fuels could be put into mass production for far less cost than a fraction of what is put into EVs in subsidies to bring us massively lower CO2 emissions than EVs.<br>10: Absolutely false. There is absolutely no basis on EVs being in any way different in safety features, sensors, or any &#39;self-driving&#39; stuff. Totally ridiculous statement.<br><br>And please no &quot;shill&quot;, &quot;hater&quot;, etc. comments: I bought my BMW i3 (with my own money) many many years ago as an early adopter, I have managed EV charging projects, and have also owned 3 PHEVs now too. Nowadays I drive a lightweight purely ICE car, and have lower CO2 emissions than before. I&#39;m hoping the mass lunacy will die down enough to allow for more CNG car options to come around so I could buy a car to fill up from my local biomethane filling station (but currently no CNG cars available that I&#39;d want to buy) or some great new bioethanol production which would be great for sports car use, my current sports car could use that right now. With biomethane, biodiesel, bioethanol or in the future e-fuels there would actually be a real CO2 emissions decrease instead of the lie of that happening with EVs. That would also halt the invasion of china into the automotive industry, as currently that is what is happening and I must assume that them paying billions in bribes is what&#39;s causing such a fervent political push for EVs...<br><br>Best would be to save those many many trillions, keep our auto industry, not waste tens of thousands per taxpayer, and instead of EVs invest in actually effective CO2 emissions reduction through the construction industry and by spending just a fraction on biofuels, also creating a new domestic (or shifting our current petrochemical) industry. The alternative is wasting trillions and giving up at least 40% of the automotive industry to the chinese forever.", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T13:46:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pistonburner", "comment_text": "This didn&#39;t age well.

More torque from a standstill also means less top end speed. Most drag races between EVs and similarly equipped ICE cars have the EV take a huge lead at the start and promptly lose it near the end of the quarter mile.<br>2. Having batteries under the floor does lower the center of gravity of an EV, but also increases its weight significantly. This effectively cancels out any handling benefits. High centers of gravity were never an issue needing attention anyway, at least for performance vehicles where handling is important.<br>3. Direct thrust vectoring is only possible on quad-motor vehicles and we solved this problem already with a little device called a differential.<br>4. Electric cars are quieter, but this means that they&#39;re difficult for pedestrians to hear and means EVs lose much of their character.<br>5. Electric cars are cheaper to run than gas cars--if you live in places where gas is expensive. EVs with reasonable ranges also cost more than ICE vehicles with the same range. The thing with EVs is that more powerful EVs tend to have longer ranges, but more powerful ICE vehicles tend to have shorter ranges, making the cheapest ICE cars also the most efficient.<br>6. Electric cars are not more efficient than gas cars. If they were, then the Chevrolet Camaro 1LE would have a shorter range than the Tesla Model 3 as they have similar power to weight ratios. The Model 3 does 220 miles and the Camaro does 380 miles.<br>7. You can recharge EVs at home, and it costs 1,700 dollars for a decent charger that doesn&#39;t take over 10 hours.<br>8. There&#39;s less maintenance, except wheels/tyres, wiper fluid, and any software errors that the dealer will charge you thousands to fix by plugging their laptop in and pressing a button.<br>9. Electric cars produce CO2 when they are built. Lithium mining is as bad if not worse than oil.<br>10. Electric vehicles are leading the way towards self-driving cars because..?

The future being electric and shared points to several of the issues.   First off, most people don&#39;t own nice suburban homes with a place to plug in.   And there most certainly aren&#39;t enough solar panels on all the rooftops in any urban area to charge a one car per person solution, carbon free.   So the future must necessarily be shared. <br><br><br><br>And the only way for that to work is to make  autonomy ubiquitous,  enough so that you can summon a car in less than 5 minutes from deciding you need to go somewhere.    That&#39;s a very steep level of service density.   And even if that level of service is attained, it may still  cause overcrowding by redundancy, requiring the service to necessarily be throttled by its own congestion.  Queues then form, and lookout.

My first car was a Ford Escort Pony for $6100.00 in 1987.    It got better mileage than most V6s do, even today.   Magnets, conductors,  bearings, suspensions, and tires are not new technologies and NOT scarce and there is no reason there should not be an equivalent Electric Auto to a Ford Escort Pony for less than $20,000 in today&#39;s dollars that can run continuously for 8 hours.    The cost of the technology will be recovered with the replacement of gas cars with electric, car by car, at scale.

I have not done enough research on it but I have heard that while diesel is a byproduct of producing gasoline, companies have come up with ways of producing synthetic diesel.\u00a0Synthetic diesel coupled with biodiesel... well, I feel like Diesel engines are a strong contender for our future of vehicle use.

Compilation of the IPCC reports in 2015 proved that despite the media misusing the annual IPCC reports each year to promote the lucrative global warming myth, there was not global warming from 2000-2015 - which was the time period the UN had this panel studying the facts.

That&#39;s down to a whole mess of reasons, tire choice, suspension, mass of the car (incidentally, electric cars are all really heavy because of the enormous amounts of batteries they have to lug around), so the best electric car I&#39;ve been in, a Tesla S, handled like the very big, heavy saloon car that it is.

Anyone who might not is say, someone who doesn&#39;t have a driveway or a fixed parking spot, like you would if you live in an apartment in a busy city. 8) Less maintenance, sure, but because they are more complicated and require more specialized knowledge, you can do less of it yourself. 9) Yeah, and what if you live in a place where you don&#39;t have sun reliably enough to run your car on? Also, because electric cars are so much heavier than gas cars, they tear up the roads quicker.

Fast charging seems quite the burden for the grid, too.<br>A combination of hydrogen and electric cars would certainly mean less stress for the power grid.

No lithium mining, no hydrogen production just the usage of renawable energy and every tankstop would have a small heating unit with those stones beeing recharged.

Electric has a lot of flaws, for which I will list a few:<br><br>Firstly, lithium batteries use cobalt electrodes, and the two places you can get cobalt on Earth are the DRC and Australia. The DRC has the majority of the reserves. And let&#39;s just say that the methods used aren&#39;t good for the health of the miners, and it poisons the land, and they use child labour.<br><br>Electric batteries effectively lose a lot of power in winter. It&#39;s to do with the temperature messing with the battery chemistry and the power used by the heater. At -6C, without the heater on the range typically falls by 12%, with it on it fell by 40%. Yes, that&#39;s right 40%. Now, with the way the climate is a little screwed up and some places are now regularly experiencing -35 to -40 in places like the northern US and Canada, that&#39;s going to take a lot of power for the heater and its going to reduce the range a hell of a lot. And let&#39;s not forget, a Tesla model 3 long range model has a range of 310 miles in ideal (25C) conditions, so at -6 you&#39;re down to 186 miles of range. It&#39;s ridiculous.<br><br>And there&#39;s the fact the batteries deteriorate. I use LiPos for model aircraft, which I really need because of the need for a high voltage for the high power motor. Endurance wise, a &#39;glow fuel&#39; Or petrol IC can last a lot longer than I can, even when I fly economically. Anyway, I digress, the point is that the high discharge currents cause free lithium ions and break down the electrolyte, causing lithium oxide to build up on the electrodes and increase the internal resistance of the cell. Also, the cells begin to puff up with liberated O2 molecules from the electrolyte breaking down. Eventually, the cell needs to be decommissioned, because it can&#39;t deliver the power needed and because it is bloody dangerous and can explode if it gets too hot. Not a good idea. Same thing happens in mobiles and laptops, but at a slower rate because the power requirements are more reasonable than what&#39;s needed for a 4ft Corsair model. And so, it will happen to electric cars, and there&#39;s no way to get around it.<br>Note: lithium batteries also don&#39;t like being stored at full battery for long periods of time (long meaning more than a week). LiPos really don&#39;t like it. LiIon are more forgiving.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that resources are limited and cobalt has other uses, and there may not be enough.<br><br>So, how does the planet get around this? I say ditch electric and go for hydrogen IC. The exhaust is pure H2O, and you can make hydrogen by the electrolysis of water, so it&#39;s perfectly green.<br>Hydrogen fuel cells need platinum electrodes to catalyse the reaction. Platinum costs $27 per gram, not cheap. So, use internal combustion but switch the fuel to hydrogen. No precious metals needed.<br>Hydrogen IC would be green, provide reasonable efficiency and power, it&#39;s cold proof (unlike electric) and it would be reliable.

It&#39;s not just about C02! The production of all of the extra wiring, circuit boards, huge electric motors, batteries to store the energy and solar panels to help charge those batteries as SO bad for the planet that an entire book could be written about it! These are NOT things that gasoline cars participate in to this degree ( not even close). They aren&#39;t green! The World seems to want us to believe they are though.<br><br>They also have several major civil rights / freedom concerns that should scare anyone with enough common sense to see where things are going and studies history.<br><br>Some of them are:<br><br>Limited range: You&#39;re a lot easier to control when you can&#39;t drive more than 100 miles! With gasoline cars that isn&#39;t the case. You can realistically drive anywhere in the entire USA and back in any decently maintained car<br><br>Right / Ability to repair: Since electric cars are almost completely electronics, software and sensors fixing your own will be nearly impossible... if you are even allowed to in the first place. This is also becoming a problem in gasoline cars, but not nearly to the extent that it will be a problem with all electric cars. You&#39;re a lot easier to control when you can&#39;t fix or change your own car in any way. You&#39;re also going to be a lot more poor when you have to take it to a dealership for absolutely EVERYTHING.<br><br>Self driving cars: Ultimately means you&#39;re no longer in control of your own vehicle. The car might decide that it&#39;s better to run into a telephone pole and kill you to dodge two drunk idiots who decided to try to cross the interstate at night. It might also decide to lock the doors and drive you to a local police station ( after being issued a command by the police ) because you&#39;re not quite as politically correct as current laws say you should be. It might also decide to force you to drive to a hospital because DSS has programmed it to think that one of your kids ( in their opinion ) requires medical attention ( rather you consent to it or not ). Then there are the hackers! Imagine how fun it would be to be driving home late at night to have your car taken over by a hacker working with a local gang. The car locks the doors and drives you to a dark parking lot where you get mugged and have your car stolen ( or worse ). Bottom line is, you don&#39;t control the car. The car controls you!<br><br>Privacy issues: This is also becoming an issue with gasoline cars, but with electric cars ( because of the increased amount of sensors, software and integrated electronics ), it will basically be a rolling spy box on wheels! All of your conversations... recorded, transmitted! Where you are, how fast you are driving, what you are currently wearing, who is in the car with you, how much each of you weighs?... recorded, transmitted! Oh but don&#39;t worry, that data never gets misused and is transmitted securely to the manufacturer of the car for quality control and advertising purposes only. It will mainly be used to recommend advertising that appears on your central display at stop lights and recharging stations that you use. What could possibly go wrong? Once again, the car controls you!<br><br>It would be awesome if you made a video talking about the evils of electric cars, because I&#39;ve never seen anyone do it. However, since it would be politically incorrect and youtube would probably demonitize it... I&#39;m not expecting that anytime soon.<br><br>Bottom line: Gasoline cars are better than electric cars in every way. Prove me wrong.<br><br>Also, if you really want to make the World a greener place there are MUCH better ways to do it!<br>A few of them are:<br><br>Encourage working from home ( no need to drive in the first place ).<br><br>Create efficient central delivery services that can deliver anything that you want to buy to your house for a price lower than you could even do it yourself. ( no need for you to drive and those who do drive do it very efficiently, kind of like mass transit ).<br><br>Create all cities and towns to be walk / bicycle friendly. ( No gasoline, batteries, solar panels or electronics needed! Also would help cure several wide spread health issues in the USA ).<br><br>Create incentives for businesses that can&#39;t have people work from home to embrace a &quot;rolling rush hour&quot;. Instead of everyone working from 8 to 5  they could have 1/4th of their staff work 6 to 3, 1/4th work 7 to 4 and 1/4th work 8 to 5 and 1/4th work 9 to 6. If everyone did this it would greatly reduce rush hour traffic. It would save untold wasted man hours, lower pollution significantly, save a whole lot of wasted fuel ( if you were still driving cars. If you adopted the walking / biking solution above, then it would just decrease traffic jams ).<br><br>The problems have real solutions.

That alone should tell people something of things to come, as companies that want to stay viable don&#39;t invest in a technology that is going away. also the huge investment of battery technology development alone is an indicator. \u00a0hope my lone voice helps you realize you are correct.", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T05:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean Adler", "comment_text": "Wow the crowd turns so quickly. I appreciate this and pretty much all your videos. <br>I would say the biggest selling point of electric is the many varying paths to create electricity.  Many alternate fuels use mechanical or thermal energy to create electricity then use that to create the fuel. Each cycle through which it passes is less efficient. Electrolytic reduction to create Hydrogen is one example. Ethanol is less energy dense and uses vast amounts of arable land simply for fuel.  <br>  <br>  The only partial rival in my opinion would be Carbon Monoxide which can be created using nothing but solar concentration and cobalt, (amongst other forms). This reduces atmospheric carbon and keeps us at a net zero/zero sum process. But even then,  I would rather see the gas used to create electricity as solar concentration is not viable everywhere.  Photo/thermo-voltaics as well as water and wind energy make it more available to more areas. In the end it&#39;s a tough guess. I suppose with the right data one could see how best to proceed. Transmission of electricity, even with AC is very wasteful on a national/global scale. <br>Transporting liquid carbon monoxide uses fuel and can be dangerous. Perhaps it would need to be doped with an odor as we do with propane.  <br> <br>   Ultimately, it&#39;s easier for an individual to generate electricity than CO. CO could be more efficiently used to create electricity in a fuel station rather than used in a car where kinetic energy is oft lost. Perhaps both are options but in the end, the cars themselves will and should be electric. Pollution can be kept in concentrated factories which can then use recapture methods more effectively.  We are on the verge of a fuel cell, (aka battery) revolution. Batteries can be replaced with pretty much any other batteries and a few circuits like voltage regulators to be made compatible. Much easier than retooling and engine and converting parts to new fuels which may be corrosive and have differing pressures, temps, etc. The reason the future is electric is because there are so many paths to get there and so many advancements coming which have ubiquitous use from cell phones to solar homes to laptops and watches and everything else.

Unfortunately, your statement about their fuel source (electricity) having no impact on the environment is at best, misleading.  The sun does not show every day, everywhere, requiring the vast majority of electric vehicles to use grid power to recharge.  The world\u2019s demand for electricity increases daily.  It will continue to do so, especially as third world countries develop and come into the electronic age.  Solar panels, windmills and all other current forms of \u201crenewable\u201d energy cannot even come close to keeping up with today\u2019s power demand.  It is unlikely they will tomorrow (if ever) as mankind\u2019s thirst for electricity soars.   \r<br>Just because your electric car is not creating any emissions while driving, does not mean it has no emissions.  It just means the emissions are emitted at some distant power plant.  Also, there are plenty of emissions associate with the mining, refining and manufacturing of billions of batteries needed for all of our battery-operated devices. The emissions are still there.  They are just out of sight, out of mind.   \r<br>I have a few unanswered questions regarding batteries for electric vehicles.  Batteries are made from limited and rare resources.  And while battery costs are coming down, to put a new battery in a Prius you\u2019re looking north of $3000.  That\u2019s when the Prius goes to the scrap yard.  Not because the car has reached the end of its life.  But because the typical car owner does not plan for the expense.  When faced with three Grand for a battery, the new vehicle typically wins out.     \r<br>By the way, those solar energy panels you use to recharge your vehicle\u2026also require batteries.  Lots of very large, high capacity (and expensive) storage batteries.  Plus, an inverter and some pretty expensive electronic control equipment, to operate properly.  All of which requires frequent maintenance and periodic repair and replacement.   Again, more batteries mean, more mining, more transportation of raw materials, more refining and more exploitation of the earth\u2019s limited raw and rare elements.   \r<br>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t hate electric cars.  In fact, I agree with you, electricity will likely power vehicles of the future.  However, the person driving today\u2019s Prius who thinks they are doing their part to save the planet, may be living in a Fantasy Land.  Is it possible, in fact, they are hurting the planet, more than they are helping?  The jury is still out on this issue.   \r<br>I don\u2019t see the electric car of the future being one that uses a battery as its primary power source.  A viable electric vehicle will need a power plant that can generate substantial electric energy for long periods of time.  I\u2019m talking days, weeks or months.  With little, or no, \u201cpower up\u201d time.  Maybe, something like a fuel cell.  Or, maybe some yet undiscovered, or unperfected, method of generating substantial electrical power on demand.  Only the future will tell.   \r<br>Until then, battery power cars will remain a very expensive and fancy \u201cgolf cart.\u201d  Good for short hops around the town and making their driver\u2019s falsely feel good about themselves for saving the planet.", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T03:52:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Derek", "comment_text": "I\u2019m scared for autonomous cars because I love to drive and self driving cars will make it extremely expensive to do so", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T03:51:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cody Sexton", "comment_text": "Electric, autonomous and shared is all good if your in the city,  but out in the country like some of us are not so much.

The odd issue that I keep hearing pop up when I talk with friends or family is the charging portion - No longer is the idea of electric itself the issue, but the &quot;costly&quot; issue of charging. Firstly, many cities are beginning to implement charging stations along side gas/petrol stations but also in parking garages at hotels, airports etc. The follow up talks about the at home charging cost and that they don&#39;t have those sort of charging stations in place - Well, yea, but its not nearly as expensive as everyone seems to think. 90% of the infrastructure needed to recharge your new electric car is already in place. You have power in your home already and depending on the vehicle, all you need to do is plug in the normally included AC wall charger every night for a slower overnight charge, or just buy a fast charger which on average only costs between $500-$1200 on top of the $30,000 car that you just bought. People are afraid of what they don&#39;t understand and sadly we have gotten too used to the idea of combustion transportation but for 80% of Americans, your commute can be more than covered by the single charge of an electric vehicle.

Because there is a limited amount of exploitable Lithium on earth, so you would&#39;ve to invent a new type of battery, but there aren&#39;t many candidates for that. Lithium is maybe the best choice, Beryllium is way too toxic and even more uncommon on earth and Aluminium has a too big variety of unwanted compounds in water, for example Al(OH)3. Furthermore hydrogens energy density is much higher than of petrol or batteries. It can be stored way better and without any losses and refueled very fast. The only problem is the price, but this will, as in the development in eletric cars, decline - the catalyst is too expensive. It consists of Platinum, Rhodium and/or Palladium, which are quite common on earth but spread wildly with hardly exploitable sources. But I think it can be done and maybe I will do some research of this when I have my Degree (btw I study chemistry in vienna). Furthermore we don&#39;t know what to do with solar panels after they are used (lifetime is about only 20 years!) and they are pretty unefficient (efficency ~15%).

Holz", "comment_text": "BMW&#39;s i3 is an ugly little thing. As your video is sponsored by this company I am a bit concerned that this might affect your objectivity.  It really did feel like a BMW ad.<br><br>Since its introduction BMW has seriously dropped the ball of affordable as well as sexy EVs. Instead they focused on ugly gas-guzzling SUVs. Yes, I also want a large pick-up truck; however, I would really like to buy one that is fully electric. Ford as well as Dodge have announced that they will be electrifying their fleet of pick-up truck with Ford&#39;s F-150 and Dodge Ram being two of them. Of course I expect these things to be quite expensive at first at around 60k to 70k or more for a decently equipped one. I currently do some minor construction and landscaping work on the side and really could use a well-equipped pick-up truck with a double-cab and large flat-bed. I have sat in the F-150 and really like the exterior though I was really disappointed by the interior as it really looked typically Ford cheap. Dodge Ram definitely looked much better with a large Tesla-like center mounted screen. The quality of the materials was good esp. given that it comes from a U.S. manufacturer who usually really do not know how to build quality interiors. However, both vehicles are gas guzzlers and I cannot with good conscious get one if I also want to live more sustainably. If Ford and Dodge and other manufacturers can finally kick the oil habit and build truly usable, sporty and affordable as well reliable EVs then I am in.<br><br>Electric is great but we need significant improvements in battery tech. Solid-state batteries seem very promising. They should be much safer compared to current batteries using a liquid electrolyte as recent fires of parked as well as crashed Teslas have shown. Once the separator is pierced the chances of a thermal runaway happening increase greatly and very intense exothermic reaction, aka fire, is the the result. Also, while regular trips are not longer than 100 miles, not all people live in cities. Range anxiety is a real thing esp. when charging takes an hour or more. Charging at home is also not feasible for folks who live in apartments.\u00a0<br><br>I really do want EVs to become mainstream and companies like Tesla have really pushed the market into the right direction. The power-grid also needs to become more green. In Germany a significant amount of power is still generated using very dirty brown coal. Now that has been changing with renewables becoming competitive but the problem of storage remains. This needs to be solved. Energy costs are quite high in Germany in part because of only four large conglomerates owning and running the electrical grid though recent legislation now finally allows for individual home owner to own and operate as well as sell-back electricity produced using solar-panels on the roof. Another problem is that car companies really do not want to invest in new tech as it cuts into their bottom line. Dieselgate has shown this. Since a lot of jobs are dependent on the production of ICE vehicles politicians have been colluding with car companies for many years by looking the other way when it came to emission standards.\u00a0<br><br>Of course cars have gotten a lot greener and more efficient. New transmission technology like DCTs (I have one of those) have allowed ICE vehicles to become more responsive and sportier while improving efficiency. However, there is a limit at how efficient combustion engined vehicles can become. 21 percent is the maximum here. EVs on the other hand can easily beat that number. Again, what is important, is that we also work on the electrical grid. Increased demand on sporty and affordable as well high-range EVs should help us overcome the resistance to this &quot;new&quot; technology while hopefully creating as many new jobs as old ones are becoming obsolete.\u00a0<br><br>Something that should be a game-changer for society overall will be the successful development of energy-positive fusion nuclear power. Though of course this could still be decades away having an effectively limitless and truly clean amount of energy should allow us to move into an effectively resource-limitless society IF we steer it right. Poverty might truly become a thing of the past IF we can overcome humanities propencity for being greedy. Yes, greed can be a good thing but only if it is kept in check and within reason.

Vehicle owners that use their car battery for this purpose can make money off this, essentially buying electricity when it&#39;s cheap and selling when it costs more. This saves costs in infrastructure because the electricity grid needs to be engineered not for average, but for peak demand, which will be lower when a system like this is in place. It also alleviates the intermittentness of many renewable energy sources like wind and solar. I still think there is a place for internal combustion though, but the fuel of the future is not gasoline, and neither is it hydrogen or diesel. I think methanol, which is liquid and easy to synthesize and unlike ethanol is not limited to sugars and starches as a feedstock, is a great way to fuel the future because not only does it burn more cleanly than most other fuels, but it can readily be made from materials that are considered waste, like chaff and municipal garbage. Processing it like this is likely better for the environment by preventing the production of leachates and methane gas from the rotting process.

Incorrect<br><br><br>There is a very good video that shows these statements as incorrect and i will try and find it but in short, price is based on demand back in the day fuel for cars was super cheap but as more started to use cars the price went up and up, so as more people start sucking up electricity for EVs this will also drive up the price of power, now you can use the argument that EV lovers tend to use that everyone will install solar panels, back in reality the vast majority do not have the facility to install solar panels and yes there was a study done about this some time back ( something about a national solar power network ) so for the vast majority of people they would be reliant on the grid where over 80% of the power comes from burning fossil fuel.<br><br><br>This moves onto the &quot; better for the environment&quot; part well when you actually look into what it takes to make the electrical components and the battery&#39;s then the EV car has done more damage to the environment before it has even driven off the showroom floor not even getting into how damaging to the environment solar panels are to make, as for running the thing well it is actually very inefficient to convert fuel to electricity as there is always a loss then when running an EV as the battery drains the car does not get lighter and so more power needs to be pulled from the battery or you loose performance and this only drains the battery faster,  then a lot will say they are  totally green to run and well if well all lived in the perfect rose tinted world as these people then yes but back in reality the majority of people would be reliant on the grid and with more demand for Electricity it would mean more fossil fuels being burned at power stations in ever increasing volumes, so the pollution would simply shift from your car to the power plant but a lot of people that tout that their car is pollution free simply because it does not eject exhaust fumes, while conveniently forgetting how the car is made or how the solar panels are made or how power from the grid is made.<br><br><br>This moves us on to efficiency  and again it is far less efficient to burn fuel to make power, lets say you burn 40L of gass to make electricity well there will be a massive loss at that stage and the conversion from gass to electricity is far from 100% conversion,   then there is further loss in the power lines and then more loss when your charging unit takes that power and further loss when it finally goes into the battery&#39;s,  compare that to a gass powered car where the fuel is burned directly and while there is some loss it is very little compared to an EV and as a gass powered car burns its fuel it gets lighter and becomes increasingly more efficient, so if you took that  same 40L of fuel and burned it directly in the car you range in the gass car would be significantly greater than the EV due to the higher conversion efficiency.<br><br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong I like EVs but they certainly are not the future or a replacement for when fossil fuels run out because when that happens the power grid will simply stop and there would be no power, because as it stands the world is reliant on fossil fuels to generate power.<br><br><br>One video but there are many <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3K43XC9J82Q?t=589\">https://youtu.be/3K43XC9J82Q?t=589</a>", "comment_date": "2019-08-02T18:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "i7r00p3r", "comment_text": "Sorry but eCars are still way too expensive.

So in your video you go over the fascinating history behind electric cars, move on to data on batteries, and then go into your own experiences owning an electric vehicle, all with smooth editing and concise commentary. I enjoy that a lot and that is a big part of why i am a fan, but i would like to note that in this video you never fully presented the case against electric cars. I will say that there were a good few times you acknowledged some faults of electric cars and explained why gas powered vehicles eclipsed electric ones in the past, but after watching this video i feel like ive been left out of the rest of the conversation going on about electric vehicles. I think this video and argument would be far stronger if you first presented why some believe electric vehicles are going to cause problems and are not going to be part the future, and then destroyed those viewpoints a minute later. If veritasium is an element of truth, then i think the most honest thing to do would be to fully summarize a discussion taking place before jumping into it. If you read this, thanks for your time!
