A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

In a non-deterministic machine, the possibility of getting the right answer is not 100% like the classical computer. Although it will compute one cycle through the machine it might get the desired result or might not.<br>So if the goal is to get the right answer, you might have to run the machine many times until you get it.<br>For example if you would like to see if the string 0011 is accepted in a non-deterministic machine, because it&#39;s a 4 bit string there are 16 possible combinations so you might have to run the machine 15 times until you reach the desired 0011 but there is also the possibility to reach it on the first try, in which case it would be faster than a classical computer.<br>This is why it isn&#39;t &quot;faster&quot; than a classical computer but better for specific situations.

In contrast, the quantum computer uses the transitional period in between end states (the coin flipping in the air) to reach the solution of 50/50 much faster than the traditional method.

But per second, there will be nearly endless moment because electrons move so fast. There will come nearly endless and random signals per second because of the movement of the electron. The electrons move so fast that we can&#39;t even determine where it exactly is. So, it is not matter how long your password is, it will be detected very very very quickly.

It might be just 2 positions too. They are just making use of the randomness and speed of the electrons andthey achieve endless number of combinations. If I understand it correctly.Omg!

The system was very poorly designed, like the accuracy system for the weapons was designed that if you slow down to a walk, your guns were more accurate, but they set the parameters up so that it triggered this extra accuracy just going the slightest speed under a full run. Using +moveup which was meant for swimming in the scripting language, which is the only &quot;language&quot; I used, you could get half way between a run and a walk for movement speed and get the accuracy of a walk and the silence of it, with movement sound being another similar flaw they made in the game. That combined with scripting firing of the gun so it briefly made you do +moveup before actually firing the gun and turning it off immediately after firing the gun effectively gave you a more accurate gun at a running speed. There were many holes in the original CS system, I repeatedly told them about them on their message board, getting repeatedly banned. I remind you: I only used the extremely simplistic scripting language built into the game, so I was exploiting and not cheating, even though in effect it was cheating. CS 1.6 should have been CS 2.0 because they made major changes to the engine due to what I was spreading around. At least one of the hacks that I kept to myself and did not put into my script still exist in the current CS system as far as I know. It was basic to the Quakeworld original engine Half-Life is based on. The script that is part of my work, for CS 1.6, has a fully automated taunt system for giving people a hard time. I built a randomizer and relational database that sometimes spits out a taunt based on the weapon or weapon type you are using just before your gun is actually fired when you fire, only using the one command, alias. Alias just lets you create or reassign a command to an indicated string of commands, and nothing else.\r<br>\r<br>We are not digital and nothing in Nature is digital. Digital computers are an exact science with exact results. Nature is based on &quot;good enough is good enough&quot;. Oxford quantum physics professor Andrew Steane wrote in his paper about quantum information systems titled &quot;Quantum computing&quot; at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9708022.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9708022.pdf</a> :\r<br>\r<br>&quot;The new version of the Church-Turing thesis (now called the \u2018Church-Turing Principle\u2019) does not refer to Turing machines. This is important because there are fundamental differences between the very nature of the Turing machine and the principles of quantum mechanics. One is described in terms of operations on classical bits, the other in terms of evolution of quantum states. Hence there is the possibility that the universal Turing machine, and hence all classical computers, might not be able to simulate some of the behavior to be found in Nature. Conversely, it may be physically possible (i.e. not ruled out by the laws of Nature) to realize a new type of computation essentially different from that of classical computer science. This is the central aim of quantum computing.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>From what I understand they are forcing current quantum computers to unnaturally apply a binary state to something that has a infinite evolution of states. Think of the electron and the circle it makes around a nucleus. That 360 degrees circle it makes is infinite in precision, and that movement certainly has an effect on its surroundings. Basically, practical math is the descriptive language of the universe, and not the actual universe because it uses measurements.\r<br>\r<br>I propose a &quot;Dynamic Stateless Computer&quot; that operates on &quot;Logic Geometry&quot; based only on connections, or links, or pointers - a much more simple computer than the three basic Boolean logic gates operating on mathematical binary bits that is every computer out there. The shape is the logic and the logic is the shape, sort of like a truth table that is dynamic where the &quot;truths&quot; change as it runs. \r<br>\r<br>Quantum mechanics is beyond me, but if this only needs connections, ie a quantum entanglement, can we build a computer that operates and does its entire run instantly? Like I said, all I need is connections to perform logic... no need for information... the shape is the logic. \r<br>\r<br>You are best off going to Github and seeing online without downloading the paper and models. When someone looked at my calculators, they accused me of: &quot;You&#39;re not doing math! You&#39;re emulating math!&quot; Look at the simple calculator first, it only does addition and subtraction. Then look at the complex calculator that does multiplication and division.  As you well know, if I can do those things, I can do anything mathematically. In the main model I created if-thens, complex do-whiles, a randomizer and a relational database.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://github.com/johnphantom/Dynamic-Stateless-Computer\">https://github.com/johnphantom/Dynamic-Stateless-Computer\r</a><br>\r<br>Through the exercise of the most complex do-while I asked a question related to that, and the answer uses the ancient Chinese/Pascal&#39;s Triangle (which millions have looked at over thousands of years) in a new way: <a href=\"https://mathhelpforum.com/threads/combination-lock.17147/\">https://mathhelpforum.com/threads/combination-lock.17147/</a> I basically had to count nothing as something to count, as in you can have different items to count the permutations of but a default state of no item is possible for each, some or all to count in the permutations, and it doesn&#39;t seem anyone else in history was able to use the really basic mathematical concept of the Triangle in that way for the solution. It is similar to the 4 hats and 4 pegs question of how many permutations you can have that is commonly associated with Pascal&#39;s Triangle, but they did not count the empty pegs as part of the permutations that they can have. The technique of the implementation is a little interesting, with it being able to reach any of the 209 possible permutations of 4 wheels with 4 numbers (don&#39;t know if I should count 0, it is special in this case - if you do count 0, it is 5 numbers) in 4 keystrokes or less - it&#39;s how it scales that is the curiosity, where if I had 18 slots and 18 items to form a permutation it would have almost 3x10 to 18th power or 2,968,971,264,021,448,999 possible permutations, each reachable within 18 keystrokes or less.\r<br>\r<br>I don&#39;t have any idea as to how this would be physically built - none of the aspects of it, except for the dynamic logic that I also do not have any clue if it really is what I ask above. I just can do these things I demonstrate and in my extensive almost 50 years of digital computer experience I have not seen anything exactly like it.\r<br>\r<br>Maybe you wonder about my computer experience? I have always been fascinated by computers, starting in 1972 using a prototype Cogar 4 that my dad got his hands on, when I was 3. By the time I was 5, Singer wanted to use me in a commercial to sell the computer, because if a 5 yo could start it, load the OS and then load games, that proved anyone could. My first mentor helped develop Ethernet after working for my father, and allowed me to hold one of the first breadboard ethernet cards developed when I was 10. My first real program (programming since at least 5 if you count the Cogar ASM I had to type to get to the OS and games) was in BASIC when I was 11 that I learned from a manual without anything more than a small example for each command, written with pencil on paper; a rudimentary AI demonstration called &quot;Animals&quot;. Second program I made I had another computer (we had moved and left the one at my dads company behind when he sold it) and was a dot bouncing around the screen. Third program, with 12 year old&#39;s understanding of math, I attempted to do 3D. I first professionally programmed in 1982, started building computers and networks for a small computer company in 1986 owned by my second mentor, Peter De Blanc who lead ICANN for a period, was an official beta tester and developer for OS/2 2.0 and developed a device driver for it for the extremely complex Truevision Targa+ 64 video editing board (pic: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/hMe21Qe\">https://imgur.com/a/hMe21Qe</a> ) directly flipping bits on it in 1991. The code for the model for the dynamic stateless computer is about 640 lines and took me 6 months to complete, with the code for the Targa+ device driver being over 4200 lines and took me one 20 hour sitting that compiled and ran the first time that I have 3 witnesses for. That&#39;s almost 30 years ago. My experience has only gone up from there. This dynamic logic is something I found, that I have never seen anything like even searching for it on the Internet for the past 20 years.", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T15:16:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GreySlasher63", "comment_text": "I always thought Quantum computers had 0\u2019s 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T07:33:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sami clarck", "comment_text": "As I understand it talks about the movement of the electron in two opposite directions at the same time, if this movement can be used (on and of), meaning that zero becomes 01 by itself and the one becomes 01 by itself, i.e. using this energy as a binary code", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T19:48:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexey Slepov", "comment_text": "So at the end how does a quantum computer work?

So here enters quantum computer or a quantum simulator where you have these particles available to you directly so you can manipulate them, put them in certain state, then let them interact and then directly measure their state instead of simulating it with a classical computer.

The scale may be out of 100 in which the number 40 is closer to 0 or an off bit.<br><br>When two objects are close together they share their dielectric potential which increases the difficulty in determining where on the scale both of the objects would be.<br><br>And of course when the two objects share their dielectric potential, as with all matter in the universe, there is great uncertainty of exactly where the dielectric is spread out amongst its combined self.<br><br>What is clear is that coherent energy, or matter, is a self contained stable magnet. What is happening in the process of \u2018quantum\u2019 computing is the changing of the coherent matters magnetic stability by adding energy.<br><br>Adding energy changes the dielectric potential which is shared by all other \u2018quantum\u2019 bits. <br><br>So now the quantum bits share a slightly elevated energy state. But because of the natural stable magnetic properties of each \u2018quantum\u2019 bit there is an interplay of expanding magnetic fields which shifts the dielectric, or added energy, to someplace else.

This brings us to the Marianas Web, which is a hypothetical web system that researchers say is the &quot;Final Boss of the Internet&quot; or the &quot;Dead-end of the Internet.&quot;<br>This is what uses a massive Quantum-Geometric Compatibility system to be able to run its &quot;Heart&quot; or the &#39;core.&#39; There are many theoretical hypothetical explanations to what the heart of the  Deep Web can be. For example, The Marianas Web, which we now can nickname as &quot;The Core Web,&quot; could be some Sentient Quantum Supercomputer AI, which views the internet and IT as its own controlled system of a beast-sized mother nature world of varied and vast controlled circuits that make this mythical &quot;Computer program&quot; in which hundreds of millions of users use, like cells organized into a millionths group, each with a different purpose. Let&#39;s say this, one cell, or organization, belongs to the Government, like the FBI, CIA, NSA, The Pentagon, and the White House, or the Government sector. The government enforces law and order, digitally and realistically, and watches over internet activity. The organization sector, or the DEA, Wildlife organizations, Arbor Day foundations, and others. These create or make a cause that thousands at a time join, like a single uprising or revolution, to stop one thing bad or negative happening to a subject or object. The commercial sector controls the general everyday Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.

Quantum computers share theoretical similarities with non-deterministic and probabilistic computers, but do not have similarities with a digital computer. Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments and military agencies are funding and supporting quantum computing research in effort to develop quantum computers for business, trade, and national security purposes, such as cryptanalysis. Large scale quantum computers will be able to solve certain problems much more quickly than any classical computers that use even the best-in-use algorithms, like integer factorization using Shor&#39;s algorithm or the simulation of  quantum main-body systems. There exist Quantum Algorithms,  such as Simon&#39;s Algorithm, that run faster than any probabilistic classical algorithm.<br>Any 14-dimensional vectors that a Quantum Algorithmic Computer can use, can calculate it into the same operational matrix vector. A Quantum computer can terminate an algorithm at a lightning-fast rates, which then calculate the algorithm and convert it into trillions of quantum codes, and break it down into smaller basic blocks each light second that passes by. Light Seconds aren&#39;t a real or formal unit rate, but I&#39;m trying to make a point.<br>Imagine if, thousands of businesses that study algorithmic cryptography and Supercomputing, received a mysterious &quot;supercode&quot; that started to use hostile Quantum calculators to break down basic instructions to break the small codes and keep the Quantum system &#39;hostage.&#39; They wouldn&#39;t be able to shut it down even with the most advanced Quantum Supercomputer, since this &#39;code&#39; has already brainwashed the memory of the computer, and has gotten ready to terminate all systematic Algorithms and programs, which have confused the Quantum Computer into giving the wrong answer on what the code was, like a spreading virus.

The spin up spin down between particles turned to a fog, and even i advanced and knowing all about particle spin had trouble following you. it felt void of the details that a layman would need to connect to, to grasp each step along the way. That is why your here isnt it, to help people learn that may not understand some sciences? still i loved the video, your my favorite informer of math and science. Ok # 2. Knowing a bit about particle spin, Its best explained how einstein said it. \u00a0Imagine I have two identical breifcases, and lets use the analogy of 1 set of gloves as the two particles we create. Without looking at which, i put one in each breif case. and you send them from that spot to the ends of the universal bounderies in any direction. the only information that is available and follows the laws of physics, is that there are 2 particles and they have opposite spin. the laws are in place already, and they werent spontaniously created light years away. they have to travel apart and never faster than light. I believe personaly that media and others that didnt understand at the time, needed a spectacle and misturned what einstein really said. I dont believe he was puzlled or thought it was spooky. I think what he was saying, if the process wasnt like he exclaims, then it would be a spooky action at a distance. \u00a0media hearing him say something is spooky gets spun.

Am I supposed to be able to understand it or is that just one of quantum mechanic&#39;s quark- erm, quirks?", "comment_date": "2014-07-31T09:22:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis Tu", "comment_text": "The expert looks like an evil genius", "comment_date": "2014-07-30T04:13:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IgnemFeram01", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s why I was having trouble understanding my engineering teacher.

This is what I got from the video, please could you tell me what I got wrong/missed and explain how it can carry out more tasks at once: The computer only works on the probability of getting the right answer. In quantum mechanics nothing exists as an absolute until it is observed. Quantum computers use this by increasing the probability of the right answer for a problem in the state when it is an unknown (by eliminating all other possible outcomes) and therefore forces up the probability of arriving at the right answer when it is finally observed. The fact the computer is not dealing in absolutes also allows the computer to carry out multiple tasks at the same time, though I am not entirely sure how this works. That is another thing I need explaining.

Honestly, I couldn&#39;t. I can&#39;t bring myself to accepting the concept of &quot;two states at the same time&quot;.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_IaVepNDT4&amp;t=1m35s\">1:35</a>: &quot;When you measure the spin, it will be either up or down&quot;<br><br>So, end of the story, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s up or it&#39;s down, period. It shouldn&#39;t &quot;allow the electron to exist in both states before you measure it&quot;. If I secretly put a book inside a box and give the box to you, telling you that it may contain either a book or a phone, it won&#39;t change the fact that I already put a book in it. A phone will not materialize itself inside of the box, existing together with the book just because I told you there <b>could</b> be a phone in there. Your doubt won&#39;t change what I already did, since my actions are not subject to your observation or to &quot;what you think&quot;. If &quot;when you observe it, you will see only one of the two states&quot;, then it is not &quot;something existing at two states at the same time&quot; but rather &quot;not knowing in which of the two possible states something exists&quot;. To be able to proclaim that &quot;it exists in two states at the same time&quot;, you would have to &quot;observe it existing in two states at the same time&quot;. Now that I think about it, doesn&#39;t the whole definition of &quot;state&quot; revolves around being in a condition that is different from other conditions you could be in? I mean, what would be the point of the concept of states even existing if it weren&#39;t like that? Can you be both &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;not hungry&quot;? Can &quot;A&quot; and &quot;not A&quot;? This breaks even logic. It&#39;s paradoxical.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_IaVepNDT4&amp;t=2m54s\">2:54</a>: &quot;To determine the state of this two-spin system, I need to give you four numbers, four coefficients, whereas in the classical example of the two bits, I only need to give you two bits. So this is how you understand why 2 qubits actually contain 4 bits of\u00a0 information&quot;<br><br>Doesn&#39;t this make the qubit just the same as a pair of bits then? Where&#39;s the benefit? Moreover, if those coefficients represent the probability of the state in question being one or the other (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_IaVepNDT4&amp;t=1m43s\">1:43</a>), isn&#39;t a qubit actually <b>worse</b> at transmitting information than a pair of bits? After all, if you have to deal with probabilities to determine a state, that&#39;s prediction, which is subject to failure, while a pair of bits is always accurate and therefore more reliable (and would also be faster, since you wouldn&#39;t need extra calculations to make any predictions in the first place).<br><br>All this makes me think that, either I still don&#39;t quite grasp what quantum physics is all about or there is some serious mistake with the terminology being generally used to describe its principles (or maybe both).
