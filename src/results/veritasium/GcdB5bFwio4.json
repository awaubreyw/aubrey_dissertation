A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

That being said, those organisms are alive and then consumed and we must take into account bioaccumulation and transfer up trophic levels. The physical pesticide sounds like a nice idea but I worry that organisms may have mutations that allow them to survive and when bigger organisms (like humans) consume them and don&#39;t have the mutations to survive that theyre moisture would be sucked out. Further it may be difficult to detect the human dehydration, perhaps making people everywhere feel less healthy but not know why.

The difference is how the solvent and liquid is removed from the gel, in materials similar to contact lenses the liquid and solvents are allowed to evaporate out, leaving behind a much smaller product (a result of capillary action causing the gel to shrink as the liquid and solvents are removed). In aerogel they use a process called supercritical drying which heats the solvent to a supercritical fluid so that it expands more similarly to gas. Since it expands like a gas the solvent has less surface area and can be removed without capillary action shrinking the structure of the gel.

We are coming to a split decision as to whether who is &quot;correct&quot; and are hoping that you may be able to apply a solid scientific standard to identify which is fact; or who is &quot;more&quot; correct.<br><br><br>The question presented was, &quot;Given our earth, and referencing a satellite locked into a geostationary orbit, how long does it take for the satellite to complete one revolution around the earth?&quot;<br><br><br>We have come to two points of conclusion:<br><br><br>1. That a satellite is in an orbit around the earth, regardless of whether it is a geostationary or not. It develops that orbit by creating a motion path that &quot;encircles&quot; the earth and therefore follows the rules for a geosynchronous orbit time which equates to one sidereal day(approx 23hr 56min 4sec) to complete a revolution around the earth. This argument is further supported by thinking of the satellite orbit based on the center mass point of the earth being a &quot;single point&quot; in space as the reference and that the satellite orbits that center mass point(point in space not in motion).<br>This argument is countered with the logic that in order for the geostationary satellite to complete a revolution, its &quot;stationary&quot; position would have to be forgone and either the satellite itself must accelerate or decelerate in relation to the referenced point(earth) in order to complete its revolution; or vice-versa(earth accelerates/decelerates its rotation).<br>2. Since we are using the earth as the reference point, that the &quot;Geostationary&quot; orbit locks the &quot;0 degree&quot; reference point with the satellite to the ground point and degree reference on earth and as such, a geostationary satellite cannot complete one revolution around earth.<br>This argument is countered changing the point of view of the observer. If an observer is external to both the earth and it&#39;s geostationary satellite, it appears that the satellite will rotate around the earth(not accounting the earth&#39;s rotation)<br><br><br>Please help, does a geostationary satellite complete a revolution around the earth? If so, how often?<br><br><br>In the case that you make a video and\u00a0If you can prove that a geostationary satellite does not\u00a0make a revolution around the Earth, please say in your video, &quot;Curtis Longoria, you owe 1st Squad Pizza&quot; at some point towards the end.
