For every case of the FBI solving a case through some data gathered through newly available data, there are cases where companies abuse that data, and even governments abuse it. He brought up the insurance fear, that genetic tendencies could be used against you through no fault of your own.<br><br>But genetics also have effects on behavior. Some are genetically more prone to alcoholism, various mental disorders, etc. that have been misused in the past to link someone to criminal tendencies. That &quot;public safety is more important than&quot; excuse isn&#39;t new and has been used for racial profiling, profiling mental disorders, and other things we as a society now know are wrong. Some members of law enforcement still to this day get caught knowingly and intentionally profiling based on race, along with poverty nationality and other factors the rest of society knows are wrong, and these people argue &quot;public safety is more important than&quot; the ethics they violated.<br><br>And that&#39;s what we know about now. We don&#39;t know the scope of the genie that is being let out of the bottle here. I&#39;m worried about my 3rd cousins putting DNA into police-searchable databases, not because I plan to ever commit a crime, but because I don&#39;t know the scope of how it will be used in the future. As pointed out here, I get no say in the evil other people do, but I do get to call it &quot;evil&quot; to carelessly give away your entire family&#39;s future privacy on the off chance one of your third cousins murdered someone. <br><br>There are a lot of VERY negative possibilities. Tracing a family of a persona non grata, tracing an ethnic group that becomes undesirable to political leadership, finding gene sequences some scientist found/manufactured a correlation with criminal behavior and acting on it and then refusing to acknowledge when it&#39;s debunked because of the magnitude of harm already done... We&#39;ve seen many governments commit horrible atrocities in officially sanctioned actions in the name of &quot;safety&quot;.<br><br>I get that, with your whole view caught up in helping some family through a murder or other horrible crime, it&#39;s easy to forget that tens of thousands are CURRENTLY being massacred by governments each year because of who they are. You may trust yourself and your peers in law enforcement, but that is no more meaningful to me trusting my third cousins not to commit murder. Your predecessors, in living memory, have committed atrocities in the US. Some of them are, as we speak, individually committing horrific acts. Even the criminal this story is centered around was a former law enforcement.<br><br>So, yes, I will absolutely put privacy above solving a criminal case, no matter how heinous that case may be.

If the democrats are in charge, they may DNA sequence everyone that is a ancestor of slave owners, and garnish their wages or have them pay their ancestor&#39;s crime.  If republicans have it, they may sequence illegal immigrants too boot out family members who also entered the country illegally.  The right to privacy is of utmost importance, and if a family member can share a portion of your genetic code, their genetic information must be locked away from the state - even if the relative is fine with sharing it.

I understand such practices bother some people, but it doesn&#39;t bother me.<br><br>BUT I do draw the line at DNA privacy. That&#39;s insidious to me, and while its use in solving murder cases isn&#39;t insidious, it&#39;s a very concerning direction (and perhaps a slippery slope) that society is heading towards. It&#39;s why I have never submitted my genetic material to a private company, much less opted to assist law enforcement with my DNA. To me, it&#39;s unsettling to have such a massively descriptive, unique, permanent, inescapable ID out there; completely unshakeable and outside of my control. The &quot;massively descriptive&quot; part is what unsettles me the most. It&#39;s unsettling to know that these marketers, governmental bodies, insurance providers, and general profiteers might know things about me that... I don&#39;t even know. And they may make large decisions about me and my life that I have zero knowledge or control of. That&#39;s a true invasion of privacy, in my opinion.<br><br>I prefer to have my rights to privacy, so I will continue to refuse to submit my DNA.

As far as I know, our criminal investigators are not aloud by law to use these techniques, they\u00b4re just aloud to use DNA but not the ancesters DNA.. Sad! I would not mind, if all of us, worldwide, should have an oral DNA Swap Test and place this code in our ID-Cards. That way, ALL criminals not only sex-offenders, and others of these ill individuals would have a hard time covering their tracks and justice would be done for the victims and their families. Just imagine -  all the crime drug lords, all the humantrafficing crime lords and others, could be caught sort of in the act\u00b4?? OMG, we would have a very safe world. Us &quot;regulars Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith\u00b4s&quot; could live safely. As far as I know from my medical job, a human &quot;looses&quot; DNA samples by the minute. How wonderfull would it be and with the technology improving, OMG. I feel like a happy Utopia would happen to good hearted, law-abiding people on this planet EVERYWHERE! and I would make sure, that these DNA datas are used for criminal-stuff ONLY. So if you travel, and you have your ID card, and do something awfull, well, your fault. It would sort of make criminals walking on eggshells 24/7.. plus a suspect of a murder or sexabuse will be off the chair in the investigation room faster.

Corporations aren&#39;t subject to public opinions (we don&#39;t vote them in), so when they take an active stance in regards to legal matters (and are generally trusted), they become a black box. They have no obligation to give insight to how they run their coproration, and they don&#39;t have to take suggestions as to what can and can not be done. Hence it tend to be up to a few individuals to chose for themselves what they want to do or not.. Because of this.. What seems good when being used properly might suddenly change HOW it is being used, and because the system already is &quot;grandfathered in&quot;.. The desire to make money might mean that people start selling this information the exact same way other information is being traded today (hey; You trust facebook to sell your shopping habits to corporation for money, they buy to make money.. Why not genetic information.. it is still just another way to effectivize marketing, but now for health products)<br><br>We aren&#39;t just having to &quot;trust&quot; what &quot;is&quot; with the privacy and proper usage of data, but everything that can and might happen. The thing is that even if it was 100% in government hands- where we DO have SOME influence (though I&#39;d say that 2/3ds of the American population support people&#39;s right to have abortions, and right now even THAT is changing. The USA as it is today is as much ruled by a non-elected few who can&#39;t be specifically forced to do what people know is right; I&#39;d say the overturning of the.. was it &quot;roe&quot;?, and the ban on discussing gender or racial theories in school, etc, now literally means that USA is literally no more free than Iran ) . Historically it has been illegal to be communist (even when it has been legal completely disgusting hearings have been held in the US where actors and entertainers were harshly treated for SUSPICION of being communist- in a modern day witch-trial, and you are moving the time-line back even further).. If we can have 100% information about everything people do, then there will also be 100% of control. Part of the thing that is supposed to prevent power-miss-use is that they still have to be prepared if they go overboard there will be consequences, and when you can identify every person&#39;s identity and whereabouts at all time.. any opposition will automatically be doing something &quot;illegal&quot; and be arrested before they have any chance to do anything. <br><br>I am not pro sedition, but it IS the final release-valve it IS how all tyrannies have been overturned.. and.. History DO repeat itself (if anything today&#39;s USA should be proof of concept).. <br><br>Power corrupts.. absolute power corrupts absolutely. <br><br>I don&#39;t believe in &quot;Slippery slope&quot; arguments, but I am also not making one: Slippery slopes DO happen, they are just not a valid &quot;argument&quot;, and in this case I can say that already now there is ABSOLUTELY reason for law-abiding citizens to care; Whether it comes to fluition or not isn&#39;t even relevant, because IF it does, then WHEN it does will be too late to start pondering whether it was a good move, and if we should be overturned, because this is a choice that can&#39;t be undone.. and.. seriously.. &quot;Legal easement&quot; is a slippery slope that is part of rules of the justice system... and.. <br><br>there haven&#39;t been any nation in the world where the actual ideology &quot;If you don&#39;t have anything to hide, you don&#39;t have anything to worry about&quot; have been utilized where it also haven&#39;t lead to complete miscarriages of justice.<br><br>(Kind of like I see american police do TODAY: Police do NOT have the right to search people&#39;s cars or houses at random..

They have the right to ASK if they may search someone&#39;s abode, but.. if they answer NO, then they show that they have something to hide, thus validate their suspicion.. So &quot;you aren&#39;t allowed to search a house on a whim&quot;, becomes completely and utterly null and void. &quot;May I search your house?&quot;.

Just wanted to take the time to say that it&#39;s because of DNA that many many people who lost their freedom by being wrongly convicted have been exonerated because of DNA. Yes, DNA can be abused in theory, but it has given many people their freedom back and saved lives by catching real violent criminals, who could have otherwise committed more acts of violence, in practice. DNA is rarely wrong and I found one case where a dude was jailed because of poor use of DNA evidence and exonerated later. One cases where the lab accidently tested the same DNA twice and I seem to recall but can&#39;t refind on Google one case where the accused had 7 matched on the short tandem repeats and begged to test at one more site and they said no for a while, but eventually agreed and the 8th site was not a match, so he was innocent. But these cases are very few and far between.<br><br>Meanwhile, countless wrongful convictions are based on the notoriously unreliable eyewitness testimony: in fact, it is the leading cause of wrongful conviction. Despite that, it was still one of the most important pieces of evidence considered in court. Eyewitness testimonies also have a big impact on the jury. Something about a victim telling you confidently that this is the dude that did &quot;x&quot; to me. Vsauce2 has a great video on why Eyewitness testimony is bad.

Then banks when you put in for a loan or mortgage won&#39;t allow you to get a 30 year mortgage because your DNA says you won&#39;t live that long. Then employers will start to look into whether your genetically predisposed to severe illness or psychological issues and won&#39;t hire you. Then, what if the government requires testing for marriage licenses and denies people that both carry a predisposition to whatever? Some will say all those things are &quot;good&quot; things, but the problem is we are now judging people for things beyond their control. It&#39;s no different than saying someone shouldn&#39;t get a loan or job because of their skin color, literally. It&#39;s just genetics. These are things that should be optional and done voluntarily by people wishing to know more, not used against people by the government.<br>People always speak about the degradation of privacy like it is something people knew they were doing and had complete control over. The truth is most people really don&#39;t understand when, how and how much of their privacy they are surrendering and that is on top of what the government has taken from us all under the guise of &quot;safety&quot;. They will keep using the &quot;safety&quot; excuse. It&#39;s for the safety of your future children that you have to have genetic tests done before you can marry, etc. The truth is that people don&#39;t have any idea how much of their privacy they are surrendering or when they are doing it. The lie that people are in control of their privacy must be overturned. Facebook alone has stolen so much of our privacy from us and it can never be recovered. The government and law enforcement should be striving to prevent further loses of privacy by the innocent masses not saying that the huge majority of the innocent masses should surrender more of their personal privacy just to make law enforcement&#39;s job easier.", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T04:01:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cody Reber", "comment_text": "Did they though.

A vaccine program that minimises the harm and spread of a serious disease is a great example of this. <br><br>One of the reasons public health systems break down is where governments fail to appreciate the value of preventing disease and minimising the harm of that disease, both of which are far more cost effective that treating a condition after it has progressed, require far less manpower, can often be done away from hospitals and therefore free up hospital resources, and enable affected patients to live normal tax paying productive lives  providing revenue for the same government that is funding the system. Prevention and harm minimisation ultimately save governments money. <br><br>The second is where there is an unrecognised factor like smoking and obesity (both of which were preventable lifestyle factors that governments ended up making worse for decades), and of course genetic inclinations and an ageing population, that will later lead to extensive burden on the health system; or a sudden impactor like a new disease that leads to chronic or delayed conditions like Rheumatic Fever or Covid-19. But again some of these can be mitigated in a public health system through a range of funding and prevention measures, including early identification of those at risk to help those individuals minimise their risk of progression at the earliest possible point. <br><br>The third and last, is where the system is badly run, and needlessly bureaucratic. Where those managing the system just don\u2019t get and don\u2019t value prevention and minimisation, and focus almost exclusively on treatment. Some don\u2019t even view prevention as part of their mandate. This leads to more people with very expensive resource intensive conditions that clog the system.

So that group of people already tends to not care as much about their DNA privacy as other people.<br><br>It\u2019s not like 70% of the general population is saying they\u2019re cool with it.<br><br>So in a way, I think that says almost the opposite- not even 100% of people who want to use these programs are comfortable with the ways the information might be used by law enforcement. <br><br>And I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think you can really say \u201cwe solved a rape, we solved a murder, so privacy is not that important in the balance\u201d. <br><br>The one guy is right that companies can use it to discriminate against people over health insurance and things like that, but I think that\u2019s just the beginning. <br><br>As we start to see things like biometric data be used for identification and things like that, having an easily breached database of people\u2019s information becomes more and more sketchy.<br><br>And then you also have to remember the ways law-enforcement has abused past science like lie detector tests, statistval analysis, psychological analysis, etc. to make innocent people look guilty. Basically any technology can be misused in a system that has a lot of bias. And the United States law-enforcement system is one of the most biased, dystopian things I can think of. <br><br>It reminds me a lot of nuclear power. It could be used to power the whole world, but in the hands of United States, it becomes a murder weapon used to threaten the entire rest of the planet into submission. <br><br>As a previous victim of sexual assault myself, I can also say that usually, you know who your rapist is. And even when you know, and have good evidence, they often still get away with their crime because there is so much bias against victims of sexual assault in the system. If you wear a short skirt, it basically doesn\u2019t matter if someone raped you. This issue with the system is a statistically proven fact. So this myth of \u201cfinding and convicting every rapist\u201d doesn\u2019t mesh with the reality of how the system handles these crimes.<br><br>And I think a lot of people who are victims of sexual assault would not be comfortable with being co-opted as poster children for why this privacy invading technology should somehow be considered acceptable even though it\u2019s incredibly dangerous. I definitely don\u2019t consent to being used as an excuse to violate people\u2019s privacy, and I think if you asked other survivors, they would feel similarly.<br><br>Also, the guy turned out to be a cop, so I think the real message here has less to do with privacy vs safety and more to do with the fact that we need to pay better attention to who our law-enforcement is and how they are held accountable.

It was done by asking for DNA to the people living nearby (at least those willing to help), sequencing thousands among them and hoping to find a (partial) match.<br><br>After a while, when all hopes seemed lost, a very close member of the killer&#39;s family was sequenced, but with a catch: even though the killer and the match shared (some) DNA, they were &quot;officially&quot; not related since one of them was an illegitimate child who was raised by a different man unknowingly (as far as I remember), therefore looking within the match&#39;s family tree was useful, but also quite a dead end! In order to catch it, detectives had to look also for the killer&#39;s mother and, again they asked for people to give in their DNA and, in the end, they were lucky enough to find another match (the mother). <br><br>I&#39;m glad they got him, but catching this killer was super-expensive because police had to sequence/sample each DNA on their own, and this shows how much more practical is to already have such databases like the ones in US. It also shows that DNA, even though it does not lie, can be misleading because there are actually many people who do share DNA but do not share the family tree. I don&#39;t know the actual number, but my educated guess will be that about 1 person over 25 is an illegitimate child, raised by the father unknowingly. This means that DNA may help but it should always be combined with old-school detective work and, also, sheer *luck*!<br><br>For those who are interested in the case, I&#39;m talking about Yara Gambirasio, a sweet little girl abused and murdered about 10 years ago.

Just like fingerprints, criminals or governments want to plant evidence to frame someone, all they had to do is make sure that the person fingerprint is left at the scene. Now, the person that has the fingerprint has to prove that it&#39;s wasn&#39;t them. Now if Criminal or government agency find a way to leave a person&#39;s DNA at a crime scene in order to frame someone else for the crime just like they can with fingerprints, now innocent people are being convicted just because their DNA was found at a crime scene. I say this, cause, during the time of Ted Bundy that identified that without a reasonable doubt that the bight makes left on victims were of Ted Bundy. Ever since that case, a lot of people were sent to jail solely on the bases of bight make identification. So many people has gone to jail because of this. Less than a decade goes by before we find that bight makes identification is not as fool proof as they thought. A lot of the accuse that went to jail by the sole evidence of bight make identification, their case was re-evaluated, and all them that went to jail solely of bight make identification was release or retried. Again, this is a good thing when use for good, but for someone that uses it bad perpist, it can be a life changer for the person being implicated. How many time has a child falsely accuse an adult of sexual contact or assault and later proven that the child has lie for the purpose of hurting them all because it didn&#39;t go their way. It doesn&#39;t matter the child lied, everyone that you know will never trust you, wanted you in their live, want you to leave around them or get a job or hirer you. The child voice is so loud that society will still believe that the accusation the lied about are true.

This can be used to track and corner political dissidents and other criminals. there&#39;s more than a few criminals who are wealthy, influential figures or their friends and family who can use this to attack their detractors while never coming to justice themselves. The only relative freedom anyone has is because they can&#39;t fully control everyone, give them that ability and all our freedom is going to disappear, it&#39;s already happening. The fact is freedom is invaluable and unfortunately freedom also is not completely safe and you cannot be both safe and free. The issue is, those choosing safety are doing so consistently at the irreversible loss of freedom for EVRYONE. Which given the point is &quot;you shouldn&#39;t choose something that makes everyone less safe because it&#39;s unfair to jeopardize their safety&quot; well that works in reverse, you shouldn&#39;t irreversibly jeopardize someone else&#39;s freedom because of your own insecurities. I also do not need a lecture from a keyboard warriors about this. a. you are already winning in the real world, so cool your jets. b. If you can&#39;t see that when a is reversible and b is not, the lesser of the two evils is a, then you are either ignorant or stupid.

Two totally random people (a young immigrant boy and an older Swedish woman) were stabbed to death in a park in a small town in broad daylight. The killer escaped. The police found some of the killer&#39;s blood on one of the victims, but they had nothing else to go on. No witnesses who could say anything useful, no motive, no connection between the victims, nothing. After 14 years of dead-ends the police had a new idea. They contacted an expert in genealogy and after a couple of years work and a lot of help from both the US and Germany, they managed to find a DNA match. They first found the killer&#39;s brothers and then the killer himself. He was an quiet, lonely man with mental health issues but no criminal record. Sometimes he heard voices in his head. One morning the voices said that everything would be alright if he just killed two people that day. So he did. Then he went back to his quiet, uneventful life as if nothing had happened. When the police later came for him he admitted his crime at once.

Most successful life embraces change and evolution at a personal level if it suits their appetite. What makes America the shining city on the hill is our strong constitution that always protects the minority, the individual, the contrarion who does not want to follow the majority and live life according to his taste and principles from the forces of the bulk/the collective. Now change can be welcomed. The question is, at what cost! and can you identify a strong narrative for downstream effects, both good/bad/grey, and put forth a set of rules in light of those downstream effects. Democracy is not a disruptive company with a CEO who rightfully sees growth, efficiency, and quick, strong decision-making as the necessary requisites for survival and dominance. Democracy is about persuasion, debate, frustratingly slow change, and exhausting all available options until a new rule is needed. Democracy is not Darwin&#39;s playground embracing new evolution driven by restless tech innovation while forgetting the least able people to assume that evolution. The identity of a strong democracy is fractured power, elected representatives with strong convictions, passive and stalemated for 99% times making it wise and less panic driven as a result, and takes its roots deep in the constitution. It takes the very long view of letting all its children grow and allow them an open landscape for best opportunity to test, discover and thrive in whichever area they choose and, if they fall, help them get back on their feet. I understand the enthusiastic proponents of change in DNA policy and other broad areas of tech and blockchain want to see with good intent and excitement in sharing the euphoria of the claimed future according to them with exponential benefits embracing new changes at a broad level will instantly provide. However, we must be wise, careful, conservative and cautious in manging the bright blinding, hypnotic light that excitement has the ability to shine, forgetting our very hyper real and highly predictable inability to identify a slippery slope of unthinkable outcomes that we will be unable to forsee by the their mere nature of being unknown and generously turn to the wisdom history has to offer for the reasons why the founders adopted specific language in our constitution, afterall the constitution has been the greatest hedge in human history against the impatient impulses of human behavior. If anyone questions that, they just need to look around the globe. To put it in context, the shining light of excitement is akin to an inexperienced adolescent enthusiastic child who downloaded robinhood and is active on reddit and twitter and tries to convince his parents he knows and understands the markets better than buffet and to give him all their savings so he can invest in meme stocks and high growth stocks to quickly triple their returns so the parents can finally buy that retirement lake house they were dreaming about. Not saying that&#39;s impossible. He might quadruple their money. Still, the amount of risk he is putting the entire family and their future in is irresponsible given it will affect all other members of the family who did not ask for it and improbable to come back from should the market have a mind of its own, which it often does\u2026 better to give him a very small amount to play with so he feels supported but keep that low risk low return diversified portfolio valuing familys survival", "comment_date": "2021-10-04T03:23:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quincy Costello", "comment_text": "my guy spent 2 years making this video, and it was WORTH it.", "comment_date": "2021-10-04T03:21:38Z", "likes_count": 47}, {"comment_by": "Matt H", "comment_text": "Do people not find this creepy?

We can make predictions about how this technology could be used, like the possibility of insurance companies targeting someone for a &quot;pre existing condition&quot; they themselves have never been aware of because they had access to a family member&#39;s DNA, but ultimately, when giving a company our DNA, we cannot have certainty about how far reaching in our lives this technology could be, or easily assess how harmful it could be to our lives. <br><br>Entire industries exist in buying and selling our data, and legal protections around privacy are currently woefully ill equipt to restrict them because of how rapidly the Internet age has developed versus how slowly the legal system moves.

See a good man knows what is and ought to be done, a criminal mind without law or a wolf in sheep clothing is a thing that would roar and boast over the rest of society, so we don&#39;t hear from the meek in this process. Why, voting is of its own problem...<br><br><br>So the world / government system of program could simply offer ancestry tracking for free to people, and then bam, nearly an instant data base.<br><br>The living privacy laws of the individual are counterintuitive to acting on simply data. I am for data, since its just a thing, however, as for a society and its judgement relation of what they perceive as a law, without double checking the society to its cause and relation to crime, therefor mercy and leniency is added unto a system, that includes the species relation to have life. Meaning... as families sizes get smaller and smaller and reduced from the earth, it is of another nature of a problem to the life of a system.<br><br><br>This program goes hand in hand with the entire health systems in which I discussed openly the inept private practice to core data relations to the individual need of a system. So as long as non forgiveness and heavy repercussions occur from a very wordy and judge society the relation of crimes to most humans are all known but remained hidden to a degree, by its own nonsense in which how they crafted their society, america and the nuremburgtrialsnad biases that come from the nation itself are a relation of impact towards what people reserve to be as judgement. In most cases weak minds prefer the elimination of a human, which I find not really a great idea, as a whole, but we have a non reformed problem. So ... when it come stoa problem perhaps it should be done.... but one off crimes and if you know.. and they only have specific rare skip set do you erase their crime so their knowledge can be transferred into society, not their nonsense emotional out bursts or logical or drug or passion or confused inducing to a crime. What society perceives as a crime...<br><br>For sinstance, here is my dilemma. The NHS commits murder on a daily basis vaccines, kills objectively more by its broad beam injections. The argument of the greater good, falls short when we examine it to say 911, that killed lesser amount and removed asbestos filled buildings and the n 135 million insurance for each building.. So.. what we have is a problem with analyzing and judgement and alike of discernment to accept what is an act of mruder. its strange that collective at of mruder in a society of the mob are not judged, this is an ongoing problem in which often relates to mass removal of human problem. IE refL Bishops that killed Hipatia, individual human minds of action, to the masses of that which follow a person. So this a relative problem in the world. Japan... mass hysteria nd forced nonsense of following and even stating they can&#39;t all be smarter then all of us? See these nonsense movements have no relation to the what a crime is... So it is of the act... Put it this way, they put a gun in your hand and conscript you to die... for their own ideals, or benefits... they create or cause a environmental impact,t IE they cluster the minds of their breathern to commit harm and thus you react from the deaths of your family at their hands and thus conflict is in full swing, to its submission to absolute nonsense, and everyone is speaking russian or german, or to whomever is taking over. Then we have capital murder, the use of money to kill impeded or stop work that creat a large amount of mental illness in society.. <br><br><br>So what they are doing is imo, against the law, since it removes the very context of truth in the sense of a greater problem of relation to the system itself to its stability. I mean if you knew of all the crimes that had ever taken place on the earth, is it really a crime? Ask yourself.. when a shark eats.. is it murder. so forcing breeds or classifications of humans without specific developments creates an environment in which a law breach can happen. So the question then remains.... how much mercy or forgiveness is related to the act. I mean the act is solely nonsense since it affects not the universe but the relation to the life of human ecology on the planet. <br><br>So judgement is a very difficult process. Sure we all would love to kill the taliban instantly or the muslims or  the catholics or christians, but the problem is their means of rivalry to their acts and other problems of ideologies to based in truth and their means of following wolves that make or create nonsense laws, to even the fields of medicine openly  committing crimes, there is a huge field of mercy to their errors and death they cause in relation to data, that isa fine tuned balance. So the acts to remove destroy to create crime though fiat, gold or action currency is&#39;t relevant to the system. So most humans have more dignity when opting int oa welcoming environment that softly encourages a better direction. However, we have been rushed backwards tim by the dignity of men solely attacked by the authors of newspapers to conscript and interfere with the natural reproductive functions of men and women. IE, &quot; If your man isn&#39;t wearing Khakis then he isn&#39;t a man.&quot; Loose quote newspaper, record ww1. recruitment add. That wielded the mental process of the female to not breed with males unless they are fulfilling a role within their controlled conflict. Just like the taliban nonsense, trust his not in them, but they know something is wrong, so its the word worshipping, so if one was above.. America a national name, it all regions divisions in the scope of the planet and quantified into grids, and there is cross languages in-between..<br><br><br> So what are nonsense conflicts. Conflicts over language, conflicts over sexual intercourse of society, conflicts over money, <br><br>The solution is... learn their languag and be welcoming and encourage them, all those old asians in english speaking countries, offer free mandarin lessons na welcome them into your community, see branch into their minds and keep the good on the path, so its more inclusive. it keeps you fresh and younger to talk in such manner, Development is that you the can converse in mandarin more and more. take it upon a volunteer narrative rather than a cost, since your shelter is obviously paid, by inclusion removes conflict.  Conflicts over sex this one is of a programmed emotion so this resolves to self control in both men and women and their native acts, communication is the best key, and a relation of desire and want... Money... well... money is simply to exchange of acts. so lets ask what someone wants? Oh if the wants are simple then its a simple solution.... why make a nrillionaire when you can absolve a conflict simply by the ought of the action... IE more life or less life dependent on the want of the family .so by freeing the persons to express their desires in a rational way, then it can be achieved,an focus on their general good direction... See... conflict is absolved though inclusion of meaning... the language itself becomes negligible as a result... In this means its also a more effective means of warfare for asia by its number lol.

There&#39;s likely some other protective genes or environmental factors that are also at play. So, there is the fear that if someone had a gene like that, they could pay higher for health insurance, but it&#39;s not so simple and clear-cut about how much of a increase risk they have. The cheap DNA tests offered by direct-to-consumer autosomall DNA tests are so few SNPs and have so many no-calls that it can miss specific genes. That may result in a 3rd cousin being seen as a 4th cousin, but miss specific genes needed for determining risk for a disease or some protective benefit. Full sequences are needed that are much more expensive.

That is potentially MILLIONS of police, lawmakers, doctors, and private citizens who support racial superiority ideologies who could potentially gain access to and discriminate against people based on their genetic information. We have done this before in our history. Beginning in 1965, and based on what we now consider bad science, males with 47 chromosomes (XXY and XYY) were targeted as supposedly prone to more violent criminal behavior than men with 46 chromosomes (XY). While the majority of the scientific community abandoned this conclusion, a quick internet search found that as late as 2012 this hypothesis was still being making it&#39;s way into scientific papers. As we have seen with climate change legislation in the US, it doesn&#39;t take the majority of specialists to to convince lawmakers with preconceived assumptions that those assumptions are correct. Indeed they are just as likely to grab hold of any publication, no matter how flawed, to use as evidence that their assumptions are true. It therefore doesn&#39;t take a large leap to see a lawmaker with alt-right ideology using unsupported scientific claims to target racial and sexual minorities based on their DNA.

So I am kind of biased against this video because as it gives more insight into the companies who do the DNA testing and how it works it is kind of one sided and repetitive in its pro and con genetic database arguments.<br>Also the title is blatantly untrue. Your <b>relatives</b> DNA is in a Database, your own DNA is not. This is important as you only get matched through the database if law enforcement (or somebody else) takes a DNA sample of <b>you</b> personally against your consent. And I really do hope that only happens in case of a committed crime.<br>This video is also very USA centered. Ancestral research via these databases is very popular in the US compared to the rest of the world. I personally think that&#39;s because they have a generally higher chance to find some exciting off continent relatives than the typical central European whose ancestors lived there for the past 1000 years. <br>Another thing that isn&#39;t mentioned here is that this method of finding criminals heavily relies on being able to find relations to a common ancestor who lived potentially several hundred years ago. Again the US makes this relatively easy as that data about relation has been largely digitalized. In other counties one would have to drive from town to town to look up family relations in old church papers and town records. Consequently while this truly is as much of a breakthrough as the fingerprint identification the process is not as smooth and foolproof as it seems here. There are also several other morally problematic parts about this which weren&#39;t discussed at all.<br>That being said this video had a certain scientific naivety to it which I normally love about the channel. The pure excitement of the people involved would have usually made me more excited.

With all respect to all the honest cops and prosecutors out there I have to wonder if the police and prosecutors in possession of other circumstantial evidence linking a person to a given crime would be as enthusiastic in revealing exculpatory DNA evidence as they would incriminating DNA evidence. If they can make a strong case against an accused without the pesky exculpatory DNA evidence which would exonerate them would they be as quick to pursue that case as they would when there is, say, 2nd or 3rd cousin DNA evidence linking the accused to said crime. It is said to be impossible to prove a negative but it would appear that DNA evidence would be able to prove that a given individual did not - AND COULD NOT - commit a given criminal act.

In fact we now know that there are multiple markers involved in the genetics of eye colour.\r<br>- The video incorrectly stated that familial searching can be done in the CODIS database. Strictly speaking CODIS is the name of the software used for performing searches in the criminal databases in the US (the same software is also used in some other countries). There are in fact three different criminal databases in the US: local DNA databases, state DNA databases and a federal database known as the National DNA Index System (NDIS). CODIS is often used as a synonym for CODIS. The FBI have specifically prohibited familial searching in NDIS. Many thousands of crimes could potentially be solved if this were allowed. And of course many more cases could be solved if all the backlogs were cleared and all the lawfully owed DNA were collected.\r<br>- The reporter incorrectly suggested that GEDmatch was used to solve the Golden State Killer case. As the LA Times revealed, it was in fact the MyHeritage database which provided the crucial lead, though both GEDmatch and FTDNA were also used.\r<br>- The video mentioned the Utah case which resulted in the change in the terms and conditions at GEDmatch whereby the entire database was opted out of law enforcement matching and everyone had to pro-actively opt in. They failed to mention the change of policy in January 2021 whereby the entire database was opted in for matching with unidentified human remains. This change was not transparent and the terms and conditions are currently highly ambiguous. And of course it is some of the unidentified human remains cases which are of the most concern (eg, the potential use of genetic genealogy to identify fetal remains, Baby Doe cases, etc).\r<br>- The reporter talked about conflicting views to sharing with law enforcement and presented this entirely as an issue relating to privacy. There has been quite a lot of research on this subject and there are in fact many different issues, eg, lack of informed consent, lack of regulation and oversight, the trans-national nature of the databases, the punishments for the crimes in the US which can result in someone\u2019s DNA being used to identify someone who receives the death penalty, etc.\r<br>\r<br>We covered all these issues in a review article in Forensic Science International Genetics &quot;Investigative genetic genealogy: current methods, knowledge and practice&quot; published earlier this year which the video&#39;s creators somehow seem to have missed.", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T11:26:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "larry kent", "comment_text": "A Paul Harvey moment, that&#39;s the rest of the story.

That second one is not a catchy title because it is not really an interesting fact. Obviously if people give up their DNA for analysis, the DNA will be in the hands of the people doing the analysis. The conclusions drawn from that (that a lot of people may be identifyable by DNA without ever giving up their own DNA) is not as applicable to viewers as you present either because it is very US-centric. These DNA services are not as widespread outside of the US as they are within it. The claim that &#39;Your DNA is in a database&#39; is likely false for many viewers, even with the most stretched interpretation of that title. I know I sound pedantic pointing this out, but I feel a channel like yours should be above the practice of embelishing the truth for views.

But secondly, and perhaps even more egregiously, he weighed up the individual rights of a crime victim against the individual privacy rights of other individuals who may be against such technologies being used like this, when in fact the more accurate comparison would one heinous crime victims rights versus the privacy concerns (which we&#39;ll assume are of lesser importance) of millions of other people. Or, to be perfectly accurate, the quest for justice of a few thousand crime victims versus million or possibly even billions of other peoples&#39; privacy concerns. EVEN IF we treat privacy as a &#39;lesser issue&#39;, it STILL gets magnified massively by the sheer number of people it affects, versus just a few thousand victims. The scales aren&#39;t level at all.\r<br>\r<br>That said, the scariest part of the video is when the Verogen CEO at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT18KJouHWg&amp;t=23m04s\">23:04</a> shared the percentage of new users who seem to be okay with signing away their privacy, as that points to a cultural shift towards just accepting that privacy is increasingly being seen as an outmoded concept. I&#39;m willing to be a large percentage of those users who said &#39;Yes&#39; were also young, have grown up with internet tracking and so have just come to accept it. Reminds me of a Tom Scott video from a awhile ago titled &#39;Privacy is Dead&#39;, in which he acts as a hypothetical person from the future describing the &#39;Brave New World&#39; in which, well, privacy is dead. And in fact it also reminds me of the Aldous Huxley novel &#39;Brave New World&#39;, which on the surface is presented as utopic even though it&#39;s really meant as a dystopian future society. People keep wringing their hands bringing up Orwells&#39; 1984-style surveillance societies, but what they&#39;re really sleeping on is a &#39;Brave New World&#39;-style future, which nowadays is looking far closer to reality than Orwells&#39; opus.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T04:05:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TCPatten", "comment_text": "So much gaslight!", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T04:05:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoManOdysseus", "comment_text": "Tinfoil hat mode: cops can and have planted drugs and C-ild -orn on people in the past, why not take DNA from a cold case (with a big enough sample size, there&#39;s probably duplicates) and claim you&#39;re guilty of some crime?", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T04:04:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Estupido", "comment_text": "If they killed in California, they will be out in a few weeks.", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T04:04:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mostakim Kabir", "comment_text": "This felt kind of like a short movie or documentary.

I think the trust in these kinds of tech/systems ultimately comes down to whether or not we trust our government (I&#39;ll speak strictly for the US here) to do the right thing, and how much we value our individual life over that of potentially greater societal benefit. That sounds obvious, but consider some examples. For those with concerns, do we (citizens of the US) believe, for example, that insurance companies would ever be allowed to sky rocket their rates for people born with specific (potential) genetic conditions (Parkinson&#39;s, Alzheimer&#39;s, etc.)? Or do we think the government would ultimately step in to balance this? The only real downside I can see to this kind of tech is accidently becoming accused of a crime you didn&#39;t commit. I do consider that a very serious tradeoff, but if that was the biggest hurdle, wouldn&#39;t companies/the government step in to address this? For any issue that arises, I truly believe society would ultimately swing in favor of a balance that allows for use of the DNA but which safeguards major concerns. Unless the government takes a turn towards history and becomes extremely corrupt (you know what I mean), I can&#39;t see the US moving in a less transparent/less protected direction. In fact, you see so much more transparency these days, and companies even saying, &quot;Look, here is what we do, here is how we use your information. You can opt out, you can chose to not use the product, etc.&quot; And in the end, what&#39;s the worse that could happen anyway? Do the benefits of society outweigh your individual rights for your very short life? I am for this technology, but I also highly value individual rights.

Where I have a problem with using genetic modeling is in the corporate sector.

I would hate to be placed on the high risk side of an actuary table just because my genetic information says that I might have an increased risk of kidney or heart issues, regardless of whether or not I actually HAVE those issues.  Thank goodness that HEALTH insurance companies, in the US at least, are barred from using genetic info to set rates or deny enrollment thanks to GINA, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.  But what about totally unregulated industries?  As genetic info becomes more ubiquitous and widespread, how long will it be before marketers use genetic information to start targeting people with specific markers?

You are worried about your privacy. But you fail to realize, it&#39;s already gone. So instead of worrying about what could happen, because it&#39;s already happening.

Technology won&#39;t stop improving and eventually your highschooler will be able to do these kind of things as a school project. So how do you regulate around it? How do you restrict the abuse of it? Those are the important questions. Not, &quot;should this even exist&quot; because it does already and will only get easier to do. Stop being stuck in the past. This tech isn&#39;t something that&#39;s coming and you can just say no to. It&#39;s here. It&#39;s something we have to deal with being part of a society. Fun part of a society, it&#39;s very difficult to prevent something from happening. Generally things only get reduced. So at best you can only reduce the threat of DNA gathering. Technology has lead to better lives in general though. If it&#39;s regulated properly, it could be used for good. The main thing is constantly advocating for good things and against misinformation.

Sure, it&#39;s easy to weigh rapists and murderers being caught against your right to &quot;privacy&quot; but as we&#39;ve seen in this video, law enforcement and genetic companies are willing to stretch what crimes worthy of using genetic information. They stretched it to include assault but what&#39;s to stop them from stretching it to include protesting. When tensions between police and civilians are at a boiling point, normal people have good reason to not want their genetic data in the hands of the police. These are points that could be made but are left out of the video. Despite Derik&#39;s gentle push back, this video does little to counter the narrative of law enforcement and private companies that your unwilling sacrifice of personal privacy is worth it if it helps them solve crimes.

It would ber very unwise to not at least consider that this would be the holy grail for any bad actor (and history shows that there have been enough of those).<br><br>The only time this was briefly addressed in the video was when it was mentioned on a side note that this could for example be abused by healthcare companys. This is of course a valid concern and honestly, that alone might be enough to disqalify the idea. But it doesn&#39;t even have to be in the private sector.<br><br>\r<br>Just try to imagine the unfathomable amount of harm this could do if that kind of system were to fall in the hands of Nazis for instance.\r<br>\r<br>I know many people are going to dislike this example, because people like to think that democracy is very robust and this scenario therefore completely out of the question. But I believe this to be wishful thinking. Mind you I am not one of these crazy people who equate modern democratic states to fascist dictatorships. All I am saying is that democracy is a fragile thing that needs to be protected very vigorously.\r<br>When Weimar Germany (read: a - not very well established, yet healty - democracy) was taken over by the Nazis, they did it by winning a fair democratic election. This fact combined with the subsequent totalitarian dictatorship (that took very little time to be fully established) and it&#39;s crimes show that we cannot assume that the government will always only be using such a system for very heinous crimes.<br><br>If we ever were in the situation that a fascistic (or any other form of extremistic) power would take over a government with access to such systems, we would face the devestating prospect of mass murder/genocide/eugenics on a scale the likes of which this world has never before seen.<br><br>\r<br>Therefore when I weigh the possible benefits with the possible risks (and their respective likelyhoods as I perceive them), I cannot help myself but come to the conclusion that this is absolutely not worth it.<br><br>Anyways this was certainly a very interesting topic and a well made video.

The worse the person the lower the level in it. If Hasanat are more then we are granted the paradise by the mercy of Allah. The better the person the higher the level granted. The lowest level of paradise is way better than all heavens and earth. Note that all billions of light years observed by scientists until now are not even the edge of the first heaven.

Having done PCR and essentially something similar to what they do here (looking for fingerprints of viruses with nearer 100% accuracy from samples taken), generally, it is a reliable method for identification. But that same method of detection is a simple way to manufacture and then leave false evidence at a crime scene (if/when some know the process and have the equipment that makes a small smear on your cardboard coffee cup where you drank from (perhaps a few hundred cells) turn into 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 copies of some of those special segments).<br><br>The beauty though, in the whole of solving puzzles involving people, such as crimes, is that a majority of criminals in the 70s-2000s didn&#39;t know enough about DNA and RNA to concern themselves with that particular piece of evidence.

Oh wait, 5th generation being implemented now to cover the entire world, 6th tomorrow. 7th in a few years. In a decade, we won&#39;t have the luxury to even say the word privacy. Everything will be monitored live, from your heartbeat, blood pressure, I&#39;ll go out and say probably mind, they will know what you think, and if you misbehave you&#39;ll be sanctioned, or neutralized.

Corrupt governments with vile people in control first weaponize, abuse and use in malicious ways, and ask questions later. The discovery of nuclear power was the best showcase, the absolute first thing we made was a damn bomb without even blinking... We went so far to even test it on fellow humans to see just what happens. Even though we knew how harmful it will be even for the innocent born in the future. Who cares about them, right?

The prerequisite for using the databases is that there already exists a DNA sample LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE by the criminal, against which a sample can be obtained by law enforcement, from the individual singled out by the data base, and shown to be a match. <br><br>In essence, the DNA database is really no more investigatively innovative than publishing an article saying &quot;hey community, does anyone know a guy who&#39;s pretty tall, drives an early 90&#39;s Bronco, has a scar on his left cheek, and is missing three fingers on his right hand?&quot; It merely serves as a means of narrowing a search down to one or several suspects. From there, guilt still must be established and provable in court, using the same standards of evidence that are normally required. The fact that police arrived at the suspect through a DNA database, while new and exciting, really does not challenge privacy issues as they relate to the law and enforcement of it. The DNA obtained from the suspect still has to be matched to the DNA recovered from the crime scene, and that evidence still must be presented to a jury for conviction. <br><br>If no DNA is left at the scene of the crime, there can be no DNA database search. Therefore, privacy concerns shouldn&#39;t exist if you haven&#39;t left your DNA all over a crime scene, because no manner of data science is going to identify you from a DNA database without a sample of your DNA to start the search.", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T18:03:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "worthaglimpse", "comment_text": "good video", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T18:03:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edgar Roock", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT18KJouHWg&amp;t=19m07s\">19:07</a> Up until the last scene I was wondering why the female scientist had a calendar from 2019 in her office.", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T18:03:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mekanic", "comment_text": "So much potential for good but also bad, the life insurance concept is kinda scary", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T18:03:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roach Dogg JR", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT18KJouHWg&amp;t=23m27s\">23:27</a> That, assuming that all law enforcement do is persecute violent criminals.

A system which only works for the supposed &quot;public good&quot; only works when the public good is actually beneficial to the public. <br><br>Once a politician creates a paradigm shift on what &quot;public good&quot; means or someone finds a way to take advantage of the system in place, everyone and everything we&#39;ve sacrificed  for the public good goes right out the window. The fact of the matter is that they aren&#39;t mutually exclusive ideas.<br><br>Consider this: A system that can identify anyone, even those who don&#39;t submit DNA, can also be used for nefarious purposes. DNA evidence can be planted, and when the system we use to solve these cases are primarily based on DNA it means there&#39;s no counter-balance. <br><br>Even if we were to assume that these organizations are 100% focused on doing the morally right thing, (an assumption I&#39;m unwilling to make), can we really say the same when the next generation, organization, etc takes over?

The issue I have is that institutions have a habit of falling short of their professed standards. There is always the danger moral backsliding and the progressive normalisation of ever lower ethical standards, especially when there are institutional pressures and incentives for a race to the bottom. It would be wrong to say that this is <b>inevitably</b> what must happen, but there is obviously a significant risk of it happening. And trusting the government to respect the privacy of their citizens was always naive, but, post-Snowden, it is downright absurd.
