And there is some group of people that may or may not be associated with government at this point that have this knowledge. They have been attempting to conceal this knowledge. People in high level government have very little, if any, valid information about this. It has been the subject of disinformation in order to deflect attention and create confusion so the truth doesn\u2019t come out. \u201d \u2015 Edgar D. Mitchell, The Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut&#39;s Journey Through the Material and Mystical World\r<br>\r<br> AFFIDAVIT (1) My name is Thomas Jefferson Dubose (2) My address is: XXXXXXXXXX (3) I retired from the U.S. Air force in 1959 with the rank of Brigadier General. (4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press. (8) I have not been paid or given anything of value to make this statement, which is the truth to the best of my recollection. Signed: T. J. Dubose Date: 9/16/91 Signature witnessed by: Linda R.

That information can be found in several ancient books that claim that there is a cycle of seven natural disasters. Such a disaster can only be caused by a ninth planet in our solar system. Planet 9 is a frightening planet, therefore it is very well known for thousands of years in the history of mankind. And it is seen in broad daylight with the naked eye, just before our era. We even have pictures of this event. Those disasters are causing a huge tidal wave, massive floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and a bombardment of fiery meteors every few thousand years. Several animal species become extinct and mankind hardly survives. The only possible natural cause of this cycle can be a ninth planet in our solar system, orbiting our sun in an eccentric orbit. We have pictures of the approaching planet, ancient sources show us the orbit of planet 9 and its whereabouts. Just east of Pisces. And it looks like LL Pegasi, the spiraled cloud, also just east of Pisces. Coincidence?  To learn much more about planet 9, the recurring flood cycle and its timeline, the re-creation of civilizations and ancient high technology, read the e-book: &quot;Planet 9 = Nibiru&quot;.

For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.\u201d Psalm 113:4-6 \u201cThe Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens. Who is like the Lord our God, Who is enthroned on high, Who humbles Himself to behold The things that are in heaven and in the earth?\u201d Revelation 1:8 \u201cI am the Alpha and the Omega,\u201d says the Lord God, \u201cwho is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. I am the Alpha and the Omega,\u201d says the Lord God, \u201cwho is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.\u201d Isaiah 40:28 \u201cDo you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired.His understanding is inscrutable.\u201d Jeremiah 23:24 \u201cCan a man hide himself in hiding places So I do not see him?\u201d declares the Lord. \u201cDo I not fill the heavens and the earth?\u201d declares the Lord.\u201d 2 Chronicles 2:6 \u201cBut who is able to build a house for Him, for the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him?

The reason for this is rather subtle, because they didn&#39;t have a problem with the idea of measuring the area of a curved region like a disk. This is because a bounded region must be greater in area than any inscribed shape and less in area than any circumsribed shape. Like, if I can draw a square entirely inside some curvy region and another square entirely outside it, then the curvy region must have an area between those two squares. But for arc lengths, that reasoning does not apply. Imagine drawing a very spiky star inside a circle. That star has a way larger perimeter than the circumference of the circle.<br><br>Archimedes reasoned--correctly--that the same containment ought to apply for convex regions. Today, there is no surviving ancient proof that the circumference and area of a circle depend only on their radius and radius squared, respectively. In other words, there is no surviving proof from the time that \u03c0 is a constant independent of the circle. This fact cannot be proved from Euclid&#39;s axioms, because arc length cannot even be defined using those axioms except for piecewise-straight lines. Euclid&#39;s <i>Elements</i> presents Eudoxus of Cnidus&#39;s proof that A/r\u00b2 is constant for all circles based on the axiom that &quot;the whole is greater than the part,&quot; applied to areas, but he never once mentions a formula for the circumference of a circle. David Richeson speculates that Archimedes provided a proof that C = 2A/r (i.e. C = 2\u03c0r) in his work <i>Measurement of a Circle,</i> but that work only survives in fragmentary form, and such a theorem is absent.<br><br>However, the theorem can easily be proved from the two additional postulates Archimedes introduces in his work <i>On the Sphere and the Cylinder</i> which include measurements of the surface areas and volumes of spheres and cylinders. These two postulates are:<br>(1) A straight line has the least length of any curve connecting two given points, and<br>(2) If a curve concave in one direction connects two points and is entirely between another curve concave in the same direction connecting those points and a straight line connecting those points, then its length is strictly between the lengths of the other curve and the straight line.<br>Thus, we can sandwich a circle between regular polygons and determine its circumference the same way we determined its area.

A circle is made up of straight lines between points on the circumference. It has no curves between points. None. &#39;Curves&#39; then result from the placement of all these straight lines at an angle to the previous pair of points. Lots of them close together makes us see this overall effect. If there were very few points on the circumference then it would be more obvious that the circle is not actually made of curves. Why is this important? Well, it is important because we can now see what Pi is. The number of decimal places of Pi correlate to the number of points around the circle.... it&#39;s the granularity of precision of the calculation of the circumference we want. Note: Pi is (apparently) infinte which means we can describe a circle to the precision we want, ...... but we can NEVER get the most precision; i.e. there is no absolute solution of the equation Pi x diameter = circumference..... And this makes sense as well because we can always increase a chosen number of points around the circle  by simply adding more points in between them (by increasing the decimal place of Pi in the calculation). What is the conclusion then? 1) curves don&#39;t exist between points, 2) Pi is infinite, 3) the precision of the circumference of a circle is ONLY the result of the decimal places in Pi and 4) there is no &#39;complete&#39; circle (no solution), just our misguided view that a circle has a contiguous circumference. This blows my mind, that we would never have enough time to calculate the absolute circumference of a circle and therefore the circumference can never be found from the diameter.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed.

I divide the Circle, of any radius, but easiest with a radius of 1 into 4 right angled Triangles. . . So these 1st triangles have sides of 1, so A1 = 1, and B1 = 1. . . . n is just a number from 1 to infinity.. <br><br>So the first line would be  P = 2^1 * 1 * 1 . . . The remaining 4 curved segments then each divided into two more right angled triangles with sides A2 &amp; B2. . . . And so you continue just dividing each remaining segment into ever smaller triangles, doubling the number each time. . . . <br><br>Then the 2nd line would be  P = P + 2^2 * A2 * B2.. . <br>And so the 3rd Iteration would be  P = P + 2^3 * A3 * B3.. . . You see how it goes. ? . . . <br>Very simple. . . .. . But since A1 = 1 and B1 = 1, then you have to work out what A2, A3, A4 etc and B2, B3, B4 etc will be. . . . . <br><br>So I found a way that just slots into a simple Iteration  to do that. . . That is what I consider the clever part. . . . A2 = Sq.Rt ( ( A1^2 + B1^2 ) / 4 ) just repeat this for A3, A4 etc. <br>And B2 = 1 - Sq.Rt ( 1 - A2^2 ). . . So you see this is actually very simple, working out Sq.Rt&#39;s is the hardest part. <br><br>This formula is absolute for Pi, limited only by the accuracy of the computer you can use to do the calculations. . . . You can put these simple formula into a Spreadsheet, or you can put them into a BASIC program.  . .

If this were not true, the land on which the lower buildings sit would&#39;ve been purchased and the buildings razed to build skyscrapers to gain more capacity per acre of land.", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T05:41:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tom Mantle", "comment_text": "I am but an ape.", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T05:13:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ain't it fun", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlf1ELvRzc&amp;t=1m27s\">1:27</a> rediculus.", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T04:39:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ananta wijaya", "comment_text": "22/7 gang right here", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T02:22:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Full ARM", "comment_text": "Nothing but Lies ...the globe only exist on greenscreen CGI and fish eye lense", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T21:03:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ranjit Prasad", "comment_text": "u sure ?? what about Aryabhatta .", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T17:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Playing WEiRDO", "comment_text": "&quot;Newton was playing with expressions.&quot;<br>Yes that&#39;s what 23 year old boys play with..", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T16:46:19Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Luis Santos", "comment_text": "*without calculators!", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T15:57:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hari Seldon", "comment_text": "This video made my mind &#39;pi&#39;zza&#39; hungry...", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T07:16:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Resetar Video", "comment_text": "The Discovery That Transformed Pi = iS cream", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T03:43:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mao zedung", "comment_text": "Pi does not exist", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T18:19:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamil Borowski", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlf1ELvRzc&amp;t=11m20s\">11:20</a> it is like in &quot;Contact&quot; movie, when they realize how to read alien blueprints.

Circular disc connected to bar that has magnets embedded in it&#39;s top side  all around, surrounded in high permeability material to focus magnets outward pushing force in an upwards direction from top of disc. <br> Segment 2: Hollowed out cylindrical Bar of material horizontally positioned. <br>donut shaped platter that&#39;s flattened on all sides instead of rounded, all around the flat edge of this platter, from the center is a ravine in the center so structure looks more like 2 donut shaped platters flattened on all sides &amp; sandwiched together against a smaller donut shaped platter that&#39;s flattened not rounded &amp; between them both. Square openings are located all around the outside of platters edge on both sides &amp; goes all the way through material. In these openings rectangular magnets surrounded in high permeability casings are slid into place all around platter in a matching pattern on both sides. N facing in then S facing in. <br>Connect these securely all along the length of the horizontally positioned bar except at far ends and center.<br>At both ends of horizontally positioned bar securely connect a ring of material that can be magnetically repelled (This will allow bar to spin when apart of completed construct)<br>  Build a hollow ring structure that has ring of magnetic repulsion around its inner ring that will be able to fit around main horizontally positioned bar and keep it from touching anything on account of the bar sitting on its magnetic field inside the ring. The ring structure has a rectangular bar protruding from it&#39;s outer edge &amp; has small square platform on end of it that will allow it to be screwed in to another structure.  Make 3 of these ring structures &amp; position them (approx) over both ends of horizontally positioned bar &amp; around it&#39;s center.<br>  Build hollowed out rectangular encasement that is separated into 2 pieces that can be placed on top of each other and screwed together. This encasement will fit over horizontal bar &amp; everything that is immediately around this bar. Encasement needs areas all along it&#39;s top side that has screw openings that all structures inside that need to be fastened down will be able to screw into. (Best if encasement is transparent) Encasement has round opening at both ends so when in place horizontally positioned bar with round magnetically repel-able disc attached to it  are sticking out.<br>  Build hollowed out ring structure (flattened not rounded) that has a hollowed out rectangular bar that protrudes from top and bottom of ring and has square platform at end of each that will be able to screw into inside of encasement on top and bottom. Ring structure should be able to separate into 4 halves (from middle separating top &amp; bottom &amp; from side to side on each) that sit on top of each other &amp; side by side perfectly connected when encasement is closed. Hollowed out aspect of ring structure &amp; it&#39;s protruding hollowed out bar that&#39;s connected to it is for conductive wiring to be placed so that the copper coil constructs not mentioned yet will be able to plug into this ring structure and the current can be diverted up through the hollowed out area to a point where another device can plug into it. On bottom of hollowed out ring structure there are openings where copper coil constructs can be plugged into. <br>  Build wide but small ring with ravine around its outer edge in center (kinda would look like the round metal piece you would see in a pulley system but not angled in) of structure (flat not rounded &amp; not hollow in center). Copper coil will be coiled around this. Build hollowed out rectangular structure the length of the width of the wide small ring structure. Build a plug system within it so at the center of the rectangular structure it has proper electrical plug poking out that will be able to plug into bottom side of larger ring structure that is designed to divert current. At both ends of small rectangular plug system there should be flat rectangular legs hanging down so that you can fit it perfectly over center of small wide ring structure that has copper coil wound around it &amp; screw openings at bottom of these flat rectangular legs so they can be screwed together. Ends of the copper coil are fed up into the plug securely. <br>With wiring in place screw top halves of ring structure together still separate from bottom halves. Then with wiring in place screw bottom halves of ring structure together. Now screw the already connected top halves to the inner top encasement structure &amp; same for bottom halves. Two main encasement structures still disconnected at this point. (Fine point... there are as many of these ring structures with copper coil constructs plugged into them as there are the magnetic disc constructs lined up across the length of the horizontal bar) This is because they are all to be lined up. Now with everything ready carefully lift up the Horizontal bar with the magnetic disc setup securely attached to it. At this point the magnetically repelling rings that are at far ends and center of bar should be hanging freely. Carefully position this whole thing in the bottom encasement so the copper coils are positioned perfectly in the ravine of the magnetic disc area connected to bar. Line the free hanging magnetic rings that have rectangle bars and square platforms up with the inner bottom of encasement and screw them in. At this point the horizontal bar is sitting on the magnetic fields in the rings and is securely in place connected to bottom encasement. Now pick up the top of encasement and carefully line it up the same but on top &amp; then screw the top encasement to the bottom encasement. If lined up properly you will see that when the horizontally positioned bar is made to spin, the magnetic fields will interact with the coils that are perpendicular to the magnetic field lines and since the copper coils are positioned to hang withing the ravine, the magnets on both sides will magnify the effect to achieve greater results &amp; since the magnets on both sides are set up N then S all the way around it will end up being AC current. At this point you may be wondering how will this ever equate to over unity? well we are about to get to the part that makes that possible. <br>  Build cylindrical structure (like a donut but flat not rounded on all sides but still hollow in center like a donut). The cylindrical structure is built in 2 parts. Top part &amp; bottom part. Bottom half has a ridge close to bottom center area that circles around further into the center but not all the way in. On top of this ridge is a flat ring of high permeability (magnetic field shielding) material that has small openings that will allow magnetic fields through specific locations. The top flat side of the 1st part has rectangular grooves cut into it that go almost the entire distance from outside of cylindrical structure to hollowed out center. At both the outer edge and inner edge it instead cuts down sharply &amp; narrowly at just over the width of the horizontal bar. This way when the horizontal bar in it&#39;s encasement is sitting in this spot the case fits down in and bar slides down in with a little extra space but the encasement can&#39;t shift forwards &amp; backwards. The top half of cylindrical structure has same groove but no extended ridge going further towards center. Fill the rest of the rectangular grooves with duplicates of the electric generator construct. Now carefully position top of cylindrical structure in place and screw it to bottom section. Now position the motor segment with the vertical bar that has discs on it in center of cylindrical construct so the disc is lined up perfectly underneath the inner ridge that has the flat ring of high permeability material fastened to it. Now you can duplicate this whole setup and stack it for more electrical output. (The only thing that would need to be duplicated with the motor &amp; vertical bar setup is for you to add another disc with magnets embedded in it, higher up on the vertical bar you are already using). When you turn motor on the discs will spin and the magnetic fields on them will only interact with the discs on the horizontally positioned bars when the magnetic field lines go through the small openings in the high permeability material. Since those openings are lined up with the edge of the discs connected to the horizontally positioned bars, it will force them to spin, effectively generating lots of electrical current. Just make sure to let enough of that current pump energy into the 1 motor you are using to run things, and the rest of the electric current is over unity. If you are still wondering how this could end up being over unity, the answer is simple. The device exploits magnetic field effects connected to the vertically positioned bar connected to the motor to have them do all the extra work so the motor does not have to. And since the magnets are exerting there force upwards while the bar spins around sideways, the motor won&#39;t be getting a detrimental amount of push back.

The second pada called the Ganitapada (Ganita = mathematics) bears a reference to the concept (and approximate value) of pi. In Ganitapada 10, Aryabhata says<br>\u201ccaturadhikam \u015batama\u1e63\u1e6dagu\u1e47am dv\u0101\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6distath\u0101 sahasr\u0101\u1e47\u0101m<br>ayutadvayavi\u1e63kambhasy\u0101sanno v\u1e5bttapari\u1e47\u0101ha\u1e25\u201d<br>(Please note the format of this verse. It is extremely similar to the Vedic Mathematics sutras popularized by Shri. Bharati Tirtha Maharaj and refers to a form of writing in the Vedic times that was intended to be easy to memorize and thus recall).<br>Translated into English, this verse means: \u201cAdd four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.<br>In other words, what Aryabhata said was that circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20000 is (4+100) x8 +62000= 62832. And we know that the value of pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, so in this case 62832/20000, which is incredibly 3.1416.<br><br>Also the gregory-leibniz series was first ascribed by Indian mathematician Madhava shashtri in its original form.

Secondly ,sad fact  : when we talk about  Pi, those results by fundamental formulas as C=2Pi*r  , A=Pi*r^2  have never been proven . Newton just made everything more effective . But all can be still traced back to bisecting a circle and using pytaghoras theorem. The fundamental problem of this method is the bisecting itself . This has a lot to do with Zeno paradox of dividing by 2.  But instead of doubling the problem by every bisection the problem multiply by 6.  So in case of 2^62 polygon , you have exact same  amount of problems ,where the line is shorter than the curve above the line . This method we use has this fundamental flaw and logically we never ever can reach the end .  The definition of PI  , Pi=c/d  is correct ,the problem is we don&#39;t have and never will have the &quot;c&quot; .

This particular trait, along with our much higher social needs, are thought as the reasons why we,  Homo Sapiens, ended up as the masters of the planet. We evolved a set of abilities that would allow us to survive in our natural environment, but by pure chance, the very same traits allowed us to ascend from our natural environment and adapt to anywhere, while still growing and discovering new tools that further enhance our already OP abilities. This video is also an excellent example of just that. I have never fully understood equations, but I&#39;ve simultaneously always had an easy time understanding geometry, no matter how advanced. This videos mention of pascals triangle gave me an epiphany and I now see how easily convertible that some equations are and I suspect it is very much the same with a lot of other equations. I seem to find more and more that it isn&#39;t because I can&#39;t understand equations (as my primary school math teacher used to say), but rather that I don&#39;t really get the trick in the tools taught by the school system.

I have a matematical proof somewhere on my SSD. But you could try this. The Giza pyramid built around 75,000 years ago has all the natural constants built in. It is in alignment with the constellation of Orion many many light years away. With all our advanced technology today, we still can\u2019t replicate this structure to it\u2019s accuracy. The number 3.1446.... can be found in the pyramid. But we assume that they were too dumb in the past and did not know how to calculate pi.

Why we need to do calculus, because it can give you a line of fact about how shrink to zero derivations, but still, we need to know the pi is closer track of the quantitative facts about how circle formed from its 1 to 0, and 0 to -1 to adds on a infinite 1-f(factor) into closer unit of 1 minus itself, with changes into adaptive to any shapes that&#39;s when could handle all kinds of shapes into different difficulties, but we could summarize this problem into just circle estimation, so it is always with the unit is 1 circle definition, we have to think the circle is already accurate, and it can expand into different accurate shape, the nature is formed from curves, and all lines with changes will have to be thought from circle, which the infinitesimal is a circle shaped unit changes that could explain itself, so the pi is supporting the whole curving system of maths, so it kept generated, but for different kinds of shape, if you think what the shape of the universe? yes, very simple, to put pi into the machine, and to think the universe is a shape, and let the pi goes to expand with the thinking that it last lives from once it rolled outside of the universe could reach, thus we put the time circle into it, we let the time go off, and let it comes to explain, the time is going shrink into nothing with the unit formed the unite one, finish is original, and original measures the whole, so any part is equal and they are the same, and the formed the parts while the parts could follow faster ways to sum to the biggest, but I feel the most importantly truth, is the circle is the representative of what shape applies, so we use pi to pie into our estimation to measure the sound fact from something we don&#39;t know. I know something, and we let it happens. it is with a zero, at the beginning, before that is postulation minus, and the later is put forth once last.

The speakers simply ASSUME that the geometric system should primarily be based on shapes which are designed by means of straight lines.  It is clear, if you base your geometric system on shapes which are defined by straight lines, you will need to use SOME special function or functions in order to calculate things like the circumference and area of any shapes which are NOT defined by STRAIGHT LINES.  The real question to ask is: why based a geometric system on objects defined by straight lines?   The question really should be asked because straight lines do not exist, or, at the very least, are very rare.  Look around in nature, almost nothing consists of pure straight lines.  Living things are all composed of curved shapes of various kinds.  And even inanimate objects tend to be made up of rough surfaces.  Finding  something like a natural stone which which is perfectly smooth is rare; fashioning an object which has a strictly straight line, like a sharp knife, is very challenging---perhaps impossible if you are able to view these things with a microscope.  That is to say, within the realm of human perception, straight lines are not at all predominant.  Actually, CURVES are much more common than straight lines.  Moreover, if you go beyond human perception and talk on the level of physics---well, cosmologists will tell you that space, itself, is curved.  If space itself is curved, then whatever exists within space must, inherently, be a part of that curvature.  In other words, in the most fundamental sense, absolute straight lines do not exist.  The closest any line comes to being straight is a relatively straightness within the context of universal curvature of the space within with the line exists.  Given the fact that straight lines are so hard to find with human perception and do not exist at all at the level of basic physics, WHY would we have a geometric system which is BASED ON STRAIGHT LINES?  Why don&#39;t we have a geometric system in which curves are the NORM?  If we did, then we would use a sort of alternative pi for adjusting that geometric system to calculating the diameter and area of objects which are defined by non-existent straight lines.  The advantage would be that our geometric system would correspond to REALITY.  The question which nobody ever wants to discuss is why mankind adopted a geometric system which does NOT correspond to reality (one based on nonexistent straight lines) instead of a geometric system which WOULD correspond to reality (one based on objects defined by curved lines).  If you do not address this question, then you&#39;re really just engaging in propaganda for a geometric system which, ultimately, must reflect political motivations.  Why political?  Well, it is obviously not SCiENTIFIC to base a geometric system on something which does not exist (straight lines).  So there must be some non-scientific reason for using such a geometric system.  Whatever that non-scientific reason is, or reasons are, it or they must be, in some sense, political, reflecting policy choices or attitudes or preferences rather than the search for truth.", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T08:27:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JMLY LOL", "comment_text": "No one gonna talk abt the pineapple pizza???", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T08:11:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krasimir Ivanov", "comment_text": "And I discovered the Monte Carlo method when I was  7.

Lou has it right.<br>Abbot: Now Lou, how did you know that?<br>Costello: I read the script.<br>Abbot: Lou!!!<br>Narrator: Well, that&#39;s enough math for the moment.

We live in a quantum world.   They also rely on induction, which states that the same pattern should continue to infinity.   So the terms in the expansion go on forever and it is assumed that they can go on forever.   No on has tested this and you can&#39;t test this.   Then bring in quantum physics and it is a game changer.   You can&#39;t have a &quot;point&quot;  you have the uncertainty principal.    So as you are writing down your infinitely long expansion of PI, eventually the uncertainty principle will come into play and the numbers will get fuzzy.    No math today takes these things into account.  Godel ,  Turing,  all rely on induction and classical physics to construct their theories of math.   Classical physics does not exist , it is fake, so how can you base math on a fake concept ???<br>Take the concept of a circle.   What is a circle.?   A curved line drawn equidistant from a central point.   So how do you do this ?   With a pencil ?  You have to use some physical tools in the real quantum world to draw the circle.   The central point is going to move around.  How do you deal with that?   That is one problem , just for starters.  How do you guarantee the distance from the center to the circle is constant, while you are drawing the circle ?   A string will stretch.   You would be better to use light and time it&#39;s round trip.   Then the uncertainty principle will affect the clock a little bit and you will never have a constant distance from the center.   <br>I really don&#39;t know how to approach this problem but it seems like no one else is working on these problems.", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T17:04:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AH AHH", "comment_text": "What am I watching \ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T17:03:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "8bitpineapple", "comment_text": "Ludolph Van Ceulen: Spent 25 years computing the diameter of a 2\u2076\u00b2 sided polygon.<br>$10 Raspberry Pi: Computes pi to high precision faster than you can say poopity poopity pants.", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T16:58:20Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Sam Patterson", "comment_text": "Hey what was that shot of NY @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlf1ELvRzc&amp;t=16m47s\">16:47</a>?

To those Indians, let me say, that just don&#39;t bother too much about getting certificates from West. We ourselves can also propagate the knowledge about our own mathematics history and not rely on others, like our own school textbooks (certain textbooks are doing this nowadays), videos such as this, and so on.<br><br>BTW, leading institutes in history in mathematics have acknowledged Madhava like University of Manchester and University of St.Andrews.

I absolutely respect Veritasium who I have been following for 10 years and I think to be genuine. He mentioned Madhava in hos comment and made a cool video about pi afterall. And the fascinating thing I took was how humanity has calculated pi (which is a universal mathematical truth) to innumerable significant places through ingenious methods, and how geniuses like Newton,  speaking on this video&#39;s context, leapfrogged the understanding by even more ingenious methods.

It&#39;s because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12).\u00a0Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are\u00a0not\u00a0the same.\u00a0Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead.\u00a0The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15).\u00a0All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at\u00a0The Great White Throne of Judgment\u00a0and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.\u00a0<br><br>Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&amp;ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c.

Very clearly explained. Props on the pronunciation of Ceulen :) One hopefully helpful criticism: The typeface you are using now has some letter and number shapes that are easy to be confused or hard to discern in small sizes and low resolution. In typographers\u2019 terms, it is too geometric and its counters are too closed. That means, for example, that the letter O is too close in shape to the number 0, the letter e becomes a blob, and the numbers 3 and 8 are easy to confuse. It does have some numbers whose shapes are already an improvement, such as 6 and 1. I recommend looking at the the differences on the spectrum from Avant Garde (a \u201cgeometric sans serif\u201d, similar to the typeface used here) to Futura, Helvetica, Frutiger (a \u201chumanist sans serif\u201d) and finally a \u201cModern Dutch\u201d typeface such as DTL Argo.", "comment_date": "2021-03-17T00:33:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "asim suwal", "comment_text": "Awesome work mate.<br>What a fantastic video.<br>I wish that I was able to watch these kind of inspiring mathematical videos when I was a little boy.", "comment_date": "2021-03-17T00:32:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Desmon", "comment_text": "pls make more like this omg so good", "comment_date": "2021-03-17T00:32:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Seegers", "comment_text": "Dude.

But then along comes A Level maths and bloody calculus - and I discover that I simply can&#39;t do it!!  Which (to me) indicates that (unless I have a uniquely weird brain) calculus is some sort of step up in maths - in simple terms, it is not normal maths. My clever normal maths brain just couldn&#39;t handle it. And I&#39;m left wondering if this is just the only step change in maths - from simple maths to conceptual maths? Or does something similar happen throughout the whole of maths?  Are there people reading this who could understand calculus easily, but then found maths at some higher level incomprehensible?

Nilakantha Somayaji and Madhava of Sangamagramma both discovered the Maclaurin expansion of arctan(x) and used the special case x=1 to find pi/4 = 1 -1/3 +1/5 -1/7... Furthermore we know that Madhava used a 21 terms of this series to gain an 11 decimal place approximation for pi.

The case of the hexagon inside the circle is a bit clearer, if we understand that line segments are the shortest curves between two points, then you can divide the figure into 6 parts where the circle and hexagon meet each other, and it&#39;s clear that each edge of the hexagon would then have to be no longer than the circular arc because it&#39;s a line segment.

It&#39;s intuitive that the circle is shorter here, but actually reasoning it out is hard.<br><br>In order to help understand why it&#39;s tricky, for any epsilon &gt; 0 (no matter how small), it&#39;s possible to replace the circle with a curve that never gets more than a distance epsilon away from the circle, and which has arbitrarily long perimeter, by just adding lots of tiny wiggles or spikes.<br><br>One thing we might use to shore up the argument is to use the fact that these shapes are all convex, but the fact that when one convex shape lies inside another, it must have smaller perimeter, even if true, isn&#39;t a super simple thing to prove either (if you&#39;re going to try, start with only polygons at first before worrying about more general curves).<br><br>If you&#39;re starting from first principles, using area is a much easier way to get inequalities.", "comment_date": "2021-03-16T17:14:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Creative Isolation", "comment_text": "Just think, the next Newton could\u2019ve found the solution to a huge problem because of the pandemic!
