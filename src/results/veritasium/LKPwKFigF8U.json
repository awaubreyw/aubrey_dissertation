I tend to like to be occupied doing something (including consuming media) all the time, so I have to make an effort to be bored.

If you have to occasionally occupy yourself during these times, take a boring book that will let your mind wander as you read. My personal favorite is to get away - it is calming and rejuvenating. If you are single and don&#39;t like to get away, perhaps you could do a weekly &quot;power off&quot; period for a few hours at a time, when only the essentials are on - refrigerator, AC, lights - and don&#39;t neglect to power off your mobile devices or go &quot;airplane mode&quot; and put them in a drawer.

Quite often they are the projections of other people regarding things that we should be doing or being that they prefer. They usually do not have our best interest or the best interest of the planet at heart. When bored, it is much more of value to conduct insight meditation or better yet self-inquiry. Insight meditation allows us to look at the thoughts as content and dig deep into their root source not within the brain but within our history. It is this rampant creation of a life story that is the problem on the planet at the moment. We need more truth of who we are and self-inquiry can produce that.

I can&#39;t leave the tiny room, I can&#39;t open the windows, I can&#39;t do yoga or stretching because it&#39;s a tiny little room. The first week was fine, but the second week was hell. I had nothing to do and I can&#39;t do anything. I didn&#39;t have cleaning or housework to do, I can&#39;t cook, I can&#39;t talk to people, I can&#39;t draw. I didn&#39;t have a book because it was the peak of COVID and me as an overseas student threw away a lot of things just to fit the most important things in the luggage. I could only look out the window and stared at the tall buildings (can&#39;t even see the sky because the hotel is surrounded by skyscrapers). I could type a story but doing that for 15 hours every day tires me out and I would get less creative and more stressed. Life for that week was almost the same as living in solitary confinement. My body starts getting really sluggish, wake up, eat, sleep, wake up, eat, sleep. I was so bored that my body chose to shut off and sleep away the hours. I was lying on the bed lethargic like a chronically ill patient. I even had the thought of making cuts on my skin to bleed so at least it was something new and I could tend to my wounds (or inflict more pain and bleeding). To make the situation more terrifying, just right before this quarantine period, I got off the plane and sat in a large room (with wifi but without charger) from 11am to 9pm just to wait for the COVID test results. I had about 5-6 hours of online surfing but it drains the battery. I was only given a cold sandwich and a bottle of water for the whole 10 hours, so I sat there starved and cold, and I wasn&#39;t allowed to move around unless for toilets.

So when I go to places, I usually dont have wifi (maybe if the place has one but it makes me feel guilty of even using it because it is not safe). The point is that: outside of home and school, my phone was practically useless, the number of times I got lost because I needed to attend to place made me learn more about the different buses, taking the time to read street names and especially remember which path I took to come back home. Since, I was gaming less as well because Im a full time student, I feel like I had more time to commit to clubs and contribute more. I know this all sounds nice, but when I ask others to join with me to do some simple activities (boring activities) like playing chess, they laugh at me and be like &#39;&#39;Oh I haven&#39;t played it&#39;s been so long but sorry I don&#39;t have time&#39;&#39; and then proceed to surf on tiktok for an hour kinda in front of me.

There\u2019s nothing inherently immoral about that. I usually thoroughly enjoy your videos that I select to watch. However this one does not make an important &amp; valuable distinction. A state of mind where one a person is deliberately allowing themselves to let their thoughts wonder where they will for a time, can often be a conscious choice and may have nothing at all to do with boredom in anyway. I\u2019m not taking anything away from anyone who is gathered some insights from viewing this video. And I applaud you for inspiring the epiphanies that people have experienced as a result of viewing the video. However, being that I\u2019ve been a \u201ccreative\u201c from childhood and have purposely used quiet time to allow my mind to free associate for the purpose of solving visual and personal real world problems, I believe you have ignored an entire segment of what open and free thinking is truly about. Letting one minds wander is certainly not simply boredom.

We do have some books as well as keep journals and some of us draw. We engage in conversation at length and it\u2019s incredible what happens. We have a big bag that we use to hold slips of paper that we have written topics on. We each write down at least a dozen topics and each day we pull a slip of paper from the bag. This way the topics are random. The topic chosen is the main topic of the day and the conversation ebbs and flows all day.

I&#39;m literally always bored (because of the former) and underwhelmed (because of the latter) by what is happening around me. You could call me an expert on boredom and daydreaming. I also never use my phone to alleviate boredom for two main reasons. First, it bores me. And second, I&#39;ve gotten so proficient at trying to alleviate my own boredom with my thoughts that I have on many occasions just sat in a room for hours on end doing literally nothing while waiting for something. I am no more bored with that than with any other task.<br><br>As an expert on boredom, I can agree with some of the good things pointed out by this video. However, it is worth mentioning that it has some serious drawbacks. While boredom before a task can make you more creative, boredom during a task will definitely make you less creative. Bored people aren&#39;t going to put the effort into making the best decision, they are going to make the fastest, easiest decision to get done quickly. As for the altruism, I think that&#39;s more a result of introspection making you more considerate and empathetic towards other people. It&#39;s not necessarily actual altruism; it might lead to, for example, increased utilitarianism.<br><br>Honestly, I had other points for downsides to counter introspection and the rest, but now I&#39;m bored with writing this comment (I wrote the stuff below earlier).<br><br>Background fact: ADHD causes a deficiency in neurotransmitters in the brain. The brain requires these neurotransmitters to maintain conscious awareness and will prioritize any action that maintains the minimum threshold. They are generated usually whenever you find something interesting in the task you are focused on. Excess amounts are used to increase your interest in these tasks. Thus, having a severe deficiency would limit your ability to be interested and also, therefore, your ability to stay conscious while performing certain tasks. The brain will automatically force you to switch focus to anything else in the hopes that it will be interesting enough to generate enough neurotransmitters to maintain conscious functionality. This is why people with ADHD can&#39;t focus for long on a topic; they are physically incapable and that also forces them to be bored even when they are generally interested in the subject. They also tend to be impulsive as the brain&#39;s way of force-injecting some amount of surprise randomness (read: interesting stuff) into life.", "comment_date": "2021-12-02T16:47:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Doomsday", "comment_text": "So school is good for you", "comment_date": "2021-12-02T16:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse O.", "comment_text": "This is relevant for artists.

Now I am thinking like I was much younger in the wonder age where all I did was think about what something is or how it got to be. Wonder is one of the best things we humans have in this world. Always encourage others that wonder about something because you will stumble on some very interesting thoughts. I got bored and wondered if I was left handed instead of right and now I can use both to write in my journal. The pyramids have a few reasons that they where built and one reason I thought of is that they are to be looked at and wondered by anyone who see`s them.

I don&#39;t know how my brain decides what to focus on, but something will come up and I&#39;ll focus on that instead. Although there are a lot of negatives to this, like upset friends or family, there is also an equal amount of good. It makes it easier to come up with unique jokes, ideas, and ways to entertain ourselves. I may hyper focus on a video game, but more often than not my brain decides its no longer rewarding enough and I move on to something else, like my next project of home automation. It&#39;s this ability to not have our focus entrapped that allows people with ADHD to problem solve so well, even if we may not see the problem entirely through due to boredom.

Imagine I\u2019m locked in a room for three weeks only with the electric shock button and with no memory abilities; touching the button would be the only way for me to experience being alive. Thus, shocking ourselves is to choose to live a life, avoiding pain, and pursuing boredom is not. <br>At the same time, there is no denying that a brief period of boredom can benefit our brain, allowing our monkey brain to recalibrate rather than riding off the existing dopamine and endorphin-filled path, which distinguishes us from lab mice. Just that the interpretation of the experiment needs to be revised, it\u2019s not wrong to avoid boredom via pain.

Even thinking about anything than can activate a bit of boredom in me is painful and I know I have to change my job, but there is always this thought in the back of my head telling me that 3 - 5 months in the new job and I will feel the same, so I don&#39;t see any point in doing so and changing job is going to cause boredom in me too, of course I can find a job which isn&#39;t boring but jobs like that require knowledge and how to learn while being in so devastated state... Seriously, boredom can put you in a very vicious cycle if you don&#39;t look at it as it&#39;s your enemy and you underestimate it. Now I&#39;m testing listening to audiobooks at work, risking losing bonus though, and it helps a lot, now I can see how extremely tolerant to boredom I&#39;ve become, anything would entertain me, but paradoxically there is a catch, cause I would get very quickly burnt out of anything, so everything is very entertaining but only for short time, if I would have to compare it to something I would say that&#39;s like watching TV and switching channels every max 15 seconds, because the content becomes unbearable exponentially even if I know that normally I would be interested in the content.

There are times where I&#39;ll be watching a video or reading an article, and I have to pause &amp; start applying whatever new interesting concept I&#39;ve discovered into my mind. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t always have to be highly intellectual either, it can even be shallow sometimes \u2013 like if I see a cute outfit, I have to stop and imagine a storyline where I&#39;m wearing it, or I see a cute guy in a photo and he becomes a stranger I imagine meeting. I do a lot of &quot;autobiographical planning&quot;, but I can&#39;t seem to transition this into my actual life. I prefer my headspace over reality. I have a really good imagination, so much so that I could zone out completely and have been repeatedly admonished for it. <br><br>My mind palace is where I go to feel safe, build awesome worlds, and live my life as I see fit \u2013 especially bc I&#39;m so paralyzed by fear in real life.

A couple of random thoughts that sprang to mind while watching: 1. While I fully agree that boredom CAN be good for you, I think it is a two-edged sword (remember the old adage &quot;The devil makes work for idle hands&quot;): so, while scrolling through Twitter in every spare moment might be making you less inventive/creative, it could also be helping to keep you out of prison!   2. I think your description/definition of boredom as (to paraphrase) being unrelated to not having things to do but rather about not actually wanting/feeling motivated to do anything in particular, is spot-on.  In fact, I  think it might even not be going too far to consider boredom a mild form of depression.   3.  Maybe one reason to avoid boredom via even the most meaningless, frivolous activities is that we know from experience that, when mentally unoccupied, we are likely to dwell excessively on negative, rather than positive, thoughts or recall negative, rather than positive, experiences.  There&#39;s another old adage: &quot;Where you plant flowers, flowers will grow; where you plant weeds, weeds will grow; and where you plant nothing, weeds will still grow&quot;.

That is simply the truth of the universe. Things only have the subjective worth we assign to them personally. But due to a lot of psychological problems and me being a very logical thinker, I completely lost that perspective and cannot force myself to assign worth to anything. It just doesn&#39;t happen, no matter how much I try. So for a couple of years now, my life consisted of a constant struggle to kill time because the second I am not doing anything, I get caught in my thoughts, which can be very self destructive. But at the same time, I end up just sitting around bored, imagining things and thinking about stuff for at least an hour or two every single day because I also keep telling myself that doing things, like, anything, even if it is something I would have fun doing, is not worth the effort. Simply because nothing is worth anything. <br>As I said I cannot get rid of that truth stuck in the forefront of my mind and as such I cannot force myself to do anything that requires proactive action at all most of the time, since the more effort something takes, the more wasted effort it is. Simply because all effort is inherintely wasted when you understand that nothing truly matters. <br>So my point is, boredom is not good for me. All my introspection and me just being alone in my thoughts too much made me develope such a strong apathy for everything in life that I&#39;d really rather just die because there is nothing interesting anymore. I have friends, I have hobbies, but I really just suffer through everyday life and did not have a single happy day for as long as I can remember since these problems started at an early age, triggered by a lot of physical and mental abuse from my parents which made me question my worth and the general worth and meaning of anything really. The logical conclusion was that, my parents being aggressive people and me being in the way of their outbursts, of course I held no relative value or worth in those situations so they would do to me whatever they wanted. It makes sense. Everything is like that, people claim moral highgrounds by trying to establish things that have universal worth and things that we should condemn, but in reality all of that is nonsense. <br>Nothing has any worth. Nothing matters. And I can not find the motivation to do anything because of that. Not even to finally kill myself. I can not be bothered to walk to the train station and just jump infront of the next train.

I agree with the definition given, that boredom is feeling unsatisfied with the perceived options available - that boredom is a failure of imagination, and an inability to see past our own perceptions, what some Buddhists refer to as emptiness, that perception is NOT reality (sensation is as close as we get) - but boredom does not have to be a necessary step on the way to daydreaming, altruistic action, biographical planning or any more practical behavior at all.

Yes, I ponder about why this might be the case and come up with things similiar to the things mentioned in the video: \u201dIts because people are bored and people are anxious to talk to other people because of culture and insecurities when really they are desperate for human contact, since I know that most people complain of that feeling of loneliness and isolation. Aren\u2019t they the ones causing it themselves?\u201d But seriously though. I want to interact and observing passive behavior is not amusing, listening to other people while they talk is more interesting. For instance, what opinions do people have regarding some topics may give you inside-view of whether their mind is rarely reflecting big topics such as politics or not and the way someone uses words when they explain or describe may give you an indicator of how analytical or well-read someone is, or depending on what topics they bring up to the table to talk about one can possibly determine something about their personality.

I have recently experienced 11 hour work days where there was a total of 1 hour of boring work to be done scattered throughout the day, and the rest was spent waiting. It takes a very good data plan to be able to entertain yourself with a phone for that much time, and even if you do - that gets boring too. <br><br>Of the people working in this field that I know, most of them spend their off time doing exactly what they want most in life. They spend hours and hours talking out their life plans with each other. When it comes to being creative, if they aren&#39;t creative outside of work, they sure are at work.

I think another major benefit of recurring boredom is that it maintains your idea of what boredom is. If you stay entertained/boredom-free all the time, then your mind starts to get more and more sensitive to boredom. If you go far enough down that rabbit hole, certain forms of entertainment also start to seem boring. So you start watching videos at double speed, or you start having a podcast on while playing a video game, etc. At the same time, you can move your threshold for boredom far enough that even useful actions like doing your job at work or completing your homework can seem unbearably boring, which can lead to you being more distracted and less productive. You, in a sense, develop your own form of ADD. I honestly wish I would have come to that realization a long time ago, because walking back my aversion to boredom is a very irritable process, and since I feel both tired and annoyed, it&#39;s very hard to concentrate on important tasks while I&#39;m resetting my boredom threshold. I consistently tell myself that I&#39;m going to be more productive, but inevitably find myself fidgeting or doing seemingly ANYTHING other than what I want to be doing. Because this seems so similar to ADD, I&#39;m starting to wonder if it&#39;s over-entertainment that has helped lead to so many kids getting diagnosed with a learning disorder these days.

Afterwards, I took a little stroll around the city and came across a little street corner with a bench nearby. <br><br><br>I took a seat with no distractions and decided I felt like dancing. So, I got up to dance. Right there. On the corner. For no reason other than self pleasure and amusement. I could be on my phone staring blankly into a screen like everyone else around or I could entertain myself with good music and spontaneous dance. A lot more fun then talking on the phone, texting or jumping on social media. Feels more natural, too. Really, not much different than when I was kid dancing freely without a care in the world, especially out in nature.<br><br><br>As I&#39;m dancing, I notice people were slowing down in their cars, watching, pointing, smiling from ear to ear. People who were walking by would give me the nod, a fist pound or hi-five. People from literally a block away would make their way over to me and engage in conversation, complimenting my dance moves and genuinely finding it difficult to leave my company. Some would stop, watch and tell me personally they enjoyed my dancing. And all I could think was, &quot;If only they knew how much more fun I&#39;m having DOING it, then they are WATCHING it.&quot; Being a spectator of life is no where near as pleasurable as living life.<br><br><br>Those who inquired, I was trying to let people know that it&#39;s okay to just be yourself. EVERYBODY dances in the privacy of their own home. EVERYBODY sings in the shower. So why do so few of us do it in public? We&#39;re self-conscious. We&#39;re so uncomfortable being in our own skin we&#39;re afraid of other peoples opinions about us. We&#39;re bombarded with messages of what we THINK we&#39;re supposed to do or who society says where supposed to be. We&#39;re encouraged to be everything and everyone else but our true authentic self. <br><br><br>The reason why so many people got such pleasure and joy out of me dancing in public is because, deep down in their heart, I&#39;m only doing what they secretly wish they could do. What they lack the courage to do. And you would think, with all the money, wealth, material possesions and the latest gadgets and gizmos these wealthy people have, THEY would be out there dancing EVERY DAMN DAY! I mean, you have all the material comforts money can buy. Why AREN&#39;T they dancing and enjoying life?<br><br><br>Money doesn&#39;t buy personality. Money doesn&#39;t buy Spirit. Money doesn&#39;t buy heart. Money buys comfort, and that&#39;s about it. The ability to do more of the things you want to do in life. But when money becomes the goal in itself, it&#39;s pointless. People get so caught up in trying to reach the finish line, they forget to run the race. <br><br><br>Put the damn phone down. Put on a good jam and just dance, anywhere and everywhere you want. You will bring so much happiness and joy to yourself, you will become more like your true self and other people will be drawn to your energy like a bees to honey.", "comment_date": "2019-06-08T17:18:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SSP", "comment_text": "Awsome video\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2019-06-08T11:45:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve White", "comment_text": "Men dont do it because boredom.

FFS 15 minutes is not that much to be idle for the purpose of study or just pass time. Yearning or expecting something, that&#39;s a whole different story.

I know a few people that can sit for hours and do nothing. I mean nothing, just look around. I am not talking about once in a while, it is every day. My brain can not begin to understand how that is possible. My imagination has played with me and now I just except the fact their brain must be connected to WiFi . I am seventy and can not just sit. Even if I want to think, I am happier to be typing my thinking than than allowing it to disappear into the vapor of existence. <br><br>      When I was younger this was not the case. I had this self-created form of meditation. Specially when waiting in those God for saken military lines. After this video I am thinking maybe those boring lines were on purpose, because by the you finished in a line, you wanted to kill something. Back to my form of self-meditation. I would try to bring things from the back of my mind to the front again. Like reviewing almost forgotten memories. <br><br>Example 1: I would think what is an animal I have not thought about for a long time?<br>Then answer myself:  platypus <br><br>Then I would review . What do I remember about platypuses MM that is really platypi or is it platypodes?<br>They have webbed feet, lay eggs, flat beaver like tails . I know it is the last representative of some family and genus think think Nope can&#39;t pull that out think think I wonder if they are in any way related to beaver. Beavers have webbed hind feet . think think <br><br>Example 2: What person lurks in the recesses of my mind.<br>Then answer myself: My first grade teacher: Mrs. Arnt  <br><br>Then I would review: Mrs Arnt  mm ha ha Arnt ain&#39;t in the front of my mind any more. She used to be. I loved that teacher. I really loved her she was like my grandmother. She was the first person to think me a liar though. That Broke my heart. Frick&#39;en, Laurie, girl next to me said she loved me and wanted me to kiss her. She had terrible bad breath. I wouldn&#39;t even think about kissing her. Laurie smeared paste, that thick white crap, on her arm. Then told Mrs. Arnt I did it, just because I wouldn&#39;t kiss her.  All these years later I remember Mrs. Arnt saying, &quot; If she liked you well enough to want a kiss, she wouldn&#39;t get you in trouble.&quot; . I got sent time out and Mrs Arnt told my mother when she came to pick me up. My mother said, If jack said he didn&#39;t do it, he didn&#39;t do it period. You were to punish him Mrs Arnt. My mother, of course, knew how I was raised if ever I lied, my father beat the hell out me (not a smack on the butt a cruel beating) , and if I told the truth no matter how bad, I would never get hit. Lies were stupid. I never would even think about a lie. <br><br>On that day I learned several things.<br>  Because you love someone don&#39;t expect that person to trust you ( I loved Mrs Arnt like my Grandma)<br>  Love is messed up and girls are crazy ( Laurie said she loved me, yet got me in my first big trouble ) <br><br>  Mothers are wonderful  (My mother loved me and trusted me very much )<br>  Things can change  (I never forgave Mrs Arnt, and never loved her again.)<br>   Maybe beating wasn&#39;t so bad.  ( My father hated liars and I was deathly afraid of those beatings, I was <br><br>   honest as George Washington and mother knew that would never lie.)<br>Example 3: What is the nicest gift I ever received and have forgotten about.  . . .  ha ha<br><br> <br><br>\u00a0I never really get bored.", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T23:05:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Francisco", "comment_text": "LOVE this.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with doing that, but I do think that pretending it&#39;s somehow satisfying is really unhealthy, because there&#39;s another thing that boredom keeps us from doing: constantly occupying our mind with stuff that doesn&#39;t matter.<br><br>I found myself feeling much better mentally when I quit worrying so much about checking random crap on my phone. &quot;Oh no, it&#39;s been 5 minutes since I last looked at my phone and checked a comment I made on Reddit for a reply.

Some of these people will be creative and find a way out of the boredom (i.e. flicking pencils into the ceiling tiles), yet others will remain bored until someone else&#39;s creativity helps them (the buzzer in your scenario). Boredom itself is not creativity, but a catalyst for creative minds.

Instead I used an oldschool Nokia phone to make calls etc. I had that unpleasant feeling of boredom very often, every day in the 30 min long bus transportation to college, in my algebra class, when I was eating I didn&#39;t entertain myself by watching YouTube, I was bored when I was in the toilet... Sometimes I couldn&#39;t stand it, and for example, I would grab a shampoo next of me and read the ingredients while I was doing my thing in the toilet, or I played Snake on my Nokia phone in the bus, but I was generally more observant of my enviroment, which is a plus.\r<br>But yeah, this video is so true. I play the piano as a hobbie, and that week without my phone I had more ideas of melodies I could make, it felt less boring to learn new stuff. Our phones and social media are trying hard to keep us entertained on our News Feed, by throwing to us countless new and useless information that our lazy brains love. One day I met a friend, she was walking and also scrolling on her phone. &quot;Why do you do that?&quot; I asked. &quot;Walking is boring&quot; she replied, and I didn&#39;t like it. Our world is beautiful! If you don&#39;t like seeing what&#39;s going on around you while you are WALKING, then what?! That screen isn&#39;t your life... &quot;And if I was scrolling on my phone too, like you did, we would pass each other without even noticing and say a single &#39;hi&#39;. Isn&#39;t that weird?&quot;. She didn&#39;t anwser. \r<br>Lastly, that particular week I was less lazy in general. I didn&#39;t have the option to watch &quot;just one&quot; YouTube video before getting out of bed. I couldn&#39;t sleep but I was bored. So, to kill my boredom I could either let my mind wander in thoughts and daydream, or get up and start my day routine earlier, or read a book. All of these options are surely better for your mind than watching an episode of Big Bang Theory or watch stories on Instagram.\r<br>These are my thoughts. I totally agree with the video. Our brains are prisoners of that fast life. I don&#39;t say that life was better before the Internet &#39;cause Internet and new technology etc are undoubtedly brilliant inventions!

Yes, stopping to think is definitely useful, but often when we do, we get lost in negative narratives and thought loops. Having a moment of mindfulness when in line, or at a stop light can be very useful as well. You can learn to see your thoughts and observer the patterns, and connect more with your environment to feel more connected to everything around you. It promotes a state of calm and peace and allows you to process difficult emotions more easily, and it helps generate compassion for others. I&#39;d say both thinking and meditation are useful, and it&#39;s good to choose which one to do in each moment. If you&#39;re thinking and you find that the thoughts aren&#39;t serving you, you can stop and focus on your body sensations, the sounds and smells around you, and observe the thought trains passing by rather than getting pulled along by them.", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T06:44:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danny Israel", "comment_text": "oh wow, that explains my childhood", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T05:41:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Lieber", "comment_text": "Well said!

Unless one can prove that people are less altruistic today with the presence of smartphones than then were prior their prevalence, I&#39;d say that the conclusion is more based on fear and/or nostalgia for a constantly shifting &quot;golden days&quot; that seems to affect most as they get older. <br><br>Did people standing in line in the past let themselves be &quot;alone with their thoughts&quot; or find other things to concentrate on (e.g., products on display in the checkout line designed to get your attention for last-minute purchases, the person taking too long in front of you, a strange outfit someone is wearing, your immediate plans when you get home).  The outcome of being alone with one&#39;s thoughts, I hypothesize to be contingent upon the positivity of one internal dialogue (you can also spend that time waiting in line focusing on a particular slight/insult you endured recently and playing out the many levels of its offense and the many aggressive ways in which you could have responded). <br><br>What&#39;s interesting about the &quot;phone book&quot; experiment is that the participants were given a task which, even though it was a mundane one, gives a sense purpose.  This task is something to help them feel busy and someone purposeful (don&#39;t forget that knowledge that one is involved in an experiment is also bound to affect one&#39;s sense of purpose...though to what degree I can&#39;t say).  <br><br>I personally have found that I my imagination hits me full force when I&#39;m tasked with mundane activities (washing the dishes, folding clothes, etc.).  I don&#39;t think people usually feel socially &quot;at ease&quot; while waiting in lines, so the hidden factor may be social anxiety as opposed to boredom that makes people automatically pull out their phones...the awkwardness of close-encountered silent social order that occurs in elevators and waiting rooms.  <br><br>You can pull out your phone during class or you can stare out the window.  In both cases you are missing what the instructor presenting but I suppose in the latter case, according to the conclusion, you&#39;ll leave the class more creatively primed?

This is why it seems so hard to have any form of positive change and really requires some people to sacrifice the better of their lives to get others to take the time to sit down and think for once.", "comment_date": "2018-09-30T09:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lewis Massie", "comment_text": "I like to walk places without using my phone.

I\u2019ve adopted the habit of walking or riding instead of driving. Riding makes me a lot more aware of my surroundings but I find that the desire to improve often replaces any chance for deep thought (perhaps this is due to trips generally being less than 10 minutes.) Because waking is so much slower and more automatic, I find more time and opportunity to clear my head, reflect on what needs done and contemplate issues I\u2019m facing. I spent about a year taking public transit to work and then walking home. Depending on the location, it could take upwards of five hours. The streets were quiet and I could observe, contemplate my surroundings and let my mind do what it needed. I listened to large parts of the Bible during this time and found that this environment aided recognizing new details that changed my perception and understanding. Being still internally does not require physical stillness. If you can learn to be still in quiet, you can then adopt it to noisy and distracting circumstances and let your mind work wherever you are. There are many more valuable things that come from stillness than were described in the video and if learn adopt it, the dim will fade and a grand vista will reveal itself.", "comment_date": "2018-09-29T20:45:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Mouse", "comment_text": "Hi!

However, I&#39;m not certain that boredom and spending time with only your own thoughts are equivalent states. I view boredom as more of a state of ennui with your current situation/potential activities. Existing with your own thoughts without distractions can be boring, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an intrinsic condition. When I take time to let my mind wander it becomes an active condition. I become engaged. I feel like boredom exists when you are passive or disengaged. <br><br>A person can be scrolling through Facebook or watching a video or sitting in a meeting and be completely disengaged with their situation. Boredom can be having all sorts of entertainment options at your fingertips, but no urge to partake in them. It is also a part of the feeling of discomfort with just being with their thoughts. If you aren&#39;t uncomfortable with getting lost in thought, I feel like it isn&#39;t actually boredom, or perhaps the boredom lives in the time it takes to switch from engaging externally to engaging internally. I think that choice or a lack of it is a big factor in whether we find a situation boring and whether we take steps to mitigate that boredom.<br><br>What I definitely do agree with is that we are very averse to that feeling of discomfort and by moving away from it so quickly we miss out on opportunities for self refection. If we don&#39;t allow ourselves to get through that uncomfortable transition point from external to internal engagement, we have less chance to consider things deeply or make random connections that could be beneficial. <br><br>Or perhaps I just enjoy being with my own thoughts without distraction.", "comment_date": "2018-09-29T20:15:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "goonbee 51", "comment_text": "Dude it&#39;s a button that I was told not to push.

I disagree with your interpretation of the results of the study.  And your definition of boredom, I think.  If you have something to think about, you&#39;re not bored.  You&#39;re thinking.  And if someone shocks themselves out of a desire to satisfy their curiosity about whether the button actually works, or how strong the shock is, or whether the institutions ERB would actually permit a study where participants can actually shock themselves, or whether they could prepare themselves enough for the shock that they could control their reaction to it, or many other possibilities, then they wouldn&#39;t be shocking themselves to avoid being left with their own thoughts.  It is nearly impossible to guess the internal motivations of a person based on their actions and any attempt to do so usually amounts to showing off the lack of imagination of the person making the guess.<br><br>And when talking about how few people spent time relaxing and thinking, you say &quot;apparently, because thinking is boring.&quot;  That is not apparent at all.  Not even close.  We live in a society which aggressively dissuades thought.  Why not claim that people don&#39;t murder others because &#39;apparently, it is boring&#39;?  No.  People don&#39;t murder because there are social pressures not to murder, there are negative consequences to murdering, there are natural inhibitions against it, and a laundry list of other reasons.  Similarly, people don&#39;t spend time thinking because there are social pressures not to, there are negative consequences to doing so, and many people are simply not capable of it because they&#39;ve never been taught how or given any reason why they might want to.<br><br>Then you define boredom and directly contradict everything you&#39;ve said before.  &#39;Boredom is when your mind is not focused on anything in particular&#39; is a direct contradiction of claiming that spending time thinking is boredom.  If you are thinking about something, your mind is focused on that particular thing.  I would agree that boredom is when your mind isn&#39;t focused on anything in particular and just wandering.  But that, of course, means that the study had no controls or reason to believe that any of the participants were bored at all and probably has no relevance to the idea of boredom.<br><br>The phonebook study makes sense.  If you are asked to read a phonebook, you&#39;re naturally going to try to alleviate or minimize the boredom of that.  You might look for funny names, look for patterns in the numbers (which do exist, for a very long time only the digits 1 or 0 were legal middle digits for area codes and similar contraints existed for local exchanges), etc.  You get your brain in a creative mood, actively working to find something interesting rather than passively just monitoring your perception.  So you&#39;re primed to come up with ideas.  I can get behind the idea that boredom motivates you to look for new things, but not that this will just lead you to escape internal mental activity in order to replace it with some external passive experience.<br><br>As for making you more altruistic, I would think it much more likely that &quot;being bored&quot; (AKA thinking) makes you more empathetic.  When you are simply letting sensations fill your brain with perception, you&#39;re not considering the situation of others.  You&#39;re not wondering what other people might be experiencing because you&#39;re focused only on whatever is happening in front of you.  If you&#39;re busy dedicating your mind to just being, you&#39;re not considering how things could be different and you&#39;re certainly not considering what different situation other people might be in, let alone getting to the point where you might think you should try to help them in some way.<br><br>I&#39;ve always found it true that &quot;if you&#39;re bored, then you&#39;re boring.&quot;  If you&#39;ve got nothing going on in your head, you&#39;ll get bored.  If you realize how rich and full of questions and interesting things the world is, you just can&#39;t be bored.  If you&#39;re quiet and don&#39;t have some feed of ideas from someone else, your own ideas will be far more than enough to ensure you are never bored.  You&#39;ll be more engaged and pick up all kinds of interesting things to share with other people.  If you&#39;re just bored and either don&#39;t know how or aren&#39;t willing to guide your thoughts to thinking, you&#39;ll pick up very little and probably be a chore (and a bore) to be around.", "comment_date": "2018-09-29T18:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "akaneedles", "comment_text": "This video bores me!!!

That being bored has huge benefits that we are missing out on when we pick up our phone. I think there is a misunderstanding here. Being bored is a sign that we are not engaging our mind on any particular task. But picking up your cell phone I think is a priority Problem, not a boredom problem. I can use a phone 2 engage myself in creative activities like learning or writing a book. I can also use my phone to do activities that I find boring like planning my financial future or reading a manual for a piece of equipment that I need to use for work. The phone is not the problem. Being bored is simply a sign that you&#39;re not engaging your brain. It is true that when you are bored you&#39;re more likely to select an activity that you would be less likely to do if you had options that were more appealing to you personally. I really like sketching. I don&#39;t like watching football. But other people prefer the opposite. Some people find math exciting and engaging, but I don&#39;t think being bored is going to necessarily make you passionate about math. True if you&#39;re bored you may choose an activity but happens to be available that you didn&#39;t think you&#39;d like, but as it turns out you found fascinating once you had tried it. It&#39;s also true that in the face of boredom I may choose to plan for my financial future so that I can spend more time scribbling in a notebook or playing a video game when that option becomes available. But I think that&#39;s more about time management and setting priorities. Anytime you are not engaging your mind and are &quot;board&quot; I think that&#39;s just your brainsway of telling you that you&#39;re not challenging yourself enough. But it&#39;s much more important to choose things that have the most benefit to you. Playing Angry Birds might engage your mind enough to Stave off boredom, but I think we all know that there are better uses of your time. Boredom is simply an indicator of the smaller problem, but videos like this seem to assign it some magical property that suggests if I sit in a room watching paint dry it&#39;s going to have massive benefits for my brain. But somebody who can be creative and a room watching paint dry can also be creative when doing the dishes. Or doing any task that does not use that portion of your mind. By focusing on boredom, and using it to turn mobile devices into the bad guy I think we miss out on what&#39;s really going on inside of our brains. Yes we could have better priorities, and we could spend less time on Angry Birds and Facebook... But that does not mean we need to be bored.", "comment_date": "2018-09-29T15:01:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sonicthehedshot9", "comment_text": "The thing about this generation is that we are so used to stimulus at our figure tips that it doesnt take us much to get bored.
