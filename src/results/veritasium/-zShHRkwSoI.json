The reason why is so that they can scatter their seeds the greatest possible distance. Thus, it is their need to continue a resource, their progeny, that fuels part of the need to grow taller. The trees that are tallest would outlive the other trees because their seeds would take root most often, so tall trees would become a dominant trait. Children are a resource, that&#39;s why we reproduce and have them. Friendship is a treasure hunt for resources, an interaction. The interaction itself is a resource. It is not something where everybody does the same thing. Cooperation is about a mutual hunt for resources, how ever that may come about. Look how mushrooms link together to form beneficial chains of symbiotic organisms. Ultimately, everything comes down to the search for energy.

There are plenty more reasons for a tree to be tall than sunlight, and I think you would have done well to mention this or maybe do a follow up on this.<br><br>For example, if the trees canopies were at ground level then they would be subject to predation by any and every herbivore. One of the selective advantages of being tall is undoubtedly being safe from ground dwelling predators.  <br><br>There is also the issue of pollination of flowers and spreading of seeds. Different trees have different methods of pollination and spreading of seeds. Insects, bats and birds are commonly used for pollination while some trees use fruit, simple nuts or wind born seeds to spread their seeds. If all trees were short then it is difficult to see how trees which use wind to spread their seeds could flourish. There of obvious other issues for other methods as well, bug clearly it would not benefit all trees equally. <br><br>There is also the issue of climate to consider. Fire would be a devastating occurrence in short forest, as all of the highly combustible material (leaves) would be basically surrounding the trunk. This would lead to fires so hot that trees would find it difficult to survive. With the heat right at ground level, it would make it more difficult for seeds to survive a fire as well. <br><br>Flooding would be potentially similarly destructive as well, being tall undoubtedly has advantages in areas that flood constantly. Drought may be just as bad, trees which store water in their trunks would only be able to store small amounts in short trunks and so may not be able to survive a prolonged dry period. <br><br>Being at ground level would also lead to competition from other types of plants. Grasses, shrubs and the like would be able to compete with trees for water, space and sunlight. Having a tall forest canopy means that only trees can play the forest game. Vines are a common occurrence in forests, but they would be much more common in short forests and thanks to their fast growing nature may be able to completely strangle and crowd out ground level trees within a short space of time. <br><br>What about the issue of uneven land? Would a tree whose seed was unlucky enough to fall in a gully be obliged to remain the same height as the tree on the top of the hill? You might say this is fair, but the tree in the gully will have more water it can use to grow taller than the trees higher on the slope, so it is at an indirect disadvantage under this system by being forced to forego the use of resources available to it.  <br><br>I could go on, but I think that&#39;ll do it for now.", "comment_date": "2014-05-04T08:31:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Douglas Calvert", "comment_text": "In re :(~<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zShHRkwSoI&amp;t=00m36s\">00:36</a>) Respectfully, trees are not the largest organism on the planet.

If you cut down all the trees around one of those in the next couple years it would put out a bunch of shoots on the trunk, some of which would die and some of which would become full branches. That&#39;s why you see &quot;wolf&quot; trees in open fields with lots of branches really close to the ground and a relatively short main trunk. They grow towards the light and try to get as much as possible. They do do whats in their own best interest. That said many trees have different strategies.<br><br>For example, oaks tend to invest heavily in their roots early in life to try to get plenty of nutrients. As a result they have less stem growth and tend to be shorter than, say, cottonwood of the same age which invests heavily in stem growth. The oaks have evolved this strategy to out compete other species for nutrients and endure lower light conditions. Cottonwood has evolved to get above all other plants around it as quickly as possible and under stress will invest even more heavily in stem growth. Sugar maple is different from them both. It just sits there as a tiny sapling, waiting for some disturbance to open the overstory, sometimes for over a hundred years. Then when the overstory does open it grows to fill the gap. Black walnut is theorized to exhibit allelopathy, where it releases chemicals into the soil to kill off other plants. Some trees live their entire life in the understory, shaded by the trees above.<br><br>Different organisms have different strategies for survival.

I agree to some degree but putting energy into the trunk is equally important as it ensures new functional water conducting pipes (xylem) every year. When you look at a cross section of a tree trunk, you can find heartwood (dysfunctional xylem) and sapwood (functional xylem). The functional pipes are usually restricted to the outermost growth rings! In order to be able to stick around for hundreds of years trees need to have functional pipes which come in form of subsequent growth in diameter. Now one can ask what evolved first: 1) growth in diameter (which, besides making more xylem to ensure water transport over hundreds of years, also provide a foundation for additional height growth so that trees won&#39;t break) OR 2) height growth came first which needed support so that trees won&#39;t break and as a useful byproduct also produced functional pipes.
