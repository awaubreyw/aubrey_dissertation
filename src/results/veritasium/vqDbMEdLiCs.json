Also I think it&#39;s really a misconception of saying we can feel temperature but also we can&#39;t feel heat conductivity (flow) also because our sensory system has evolved to serve as a defense mechanism and not just a &quot;thermometer&quot; or so for our convenience. So, the sensation given to us will depend of many factors like temperature (absolute/relative), heat flow, correlated to our own internal/external body temperature and others like if we&#39;re having a fever, our organs condition, health state, age, etc... So, in my opinion it&#39;s a misconception that we feel temperature but the explanation of what it is is not that simple either.", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T13:19:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grae Nicholls", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve paused this well before the end at around 1 min 30.<br>It&#39;s about conductivity, heat transfer. our skin/nerves don&#39;t detect temperature in itself, they detect flow of temperature... <br>the rate heat transfers to or from an item. <br>our skin measures the transfer of temperature. things that are the same temp feel the same temp because of no transfer.<br>the colder things are absorbing heat faster from the skin than those slightly warmer things.<br>if the item is colder than the skin it feels cold and the same with warmer than the skin feeling warmer; this is the direction of the flow of heat.<br>We detect the differential and flow of heat. not an actual temperature.<br>I&#39;m going to watch the rest of the video now just to see if I&#39;m stupid.", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T11:38:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarath R.G", "comment_text": "Our body senses the rate at which heat is transferred from our body.

I&#39;m sure it has to do with metals being better heat conductors and they just feel colder because they just take away the skin heat away  from the skin, the skin probably reacts to this by sending the brain a signal that temperature is dropping, the stupid human brain just assume that must be colder because they are touching something colder when in reality is not colder. Is just as warm as any other object.<br>Also, even if this humans are stupid... didn&#39;t they ever went to school or university and learned from  thermal conductivity there?

Temperature simply measures how fast the particle is moving. The temperature near the ISS is thousands of degrees and yet you would freeze to death there. Why? Because the particles are moving extremely fast, but there are only a few of them. If you burn or freeze to death, it is heat that killed you, not temperature. Heat is measured in Joules.

In this example all variables are practically the same except for the mass of the balls, therefore the heavier one hits first. At the height that the balls are dropped in this example the force of air resistance is almost negligible because there isn&#39;t enough time for it to slow down the balls enough to make much of a difference. However, if you drop the balls in a vacuum like on the surface of the moon they would land at the same time regardless of the height. You can even drop a feather and a bowling ball in a vacuum and they will hit at the same time since there is no air resistance.

Now hold this. Which one is colder? You think so, but it&#39;s not. How can that be? Well, now look at this. And look at this. What&#39;ll happen? No, it&#39;s quite the opposite. Why&#39;s that? Well, after setting things up in an easy way where you can touch things and convince yourself of reality, let me explain stuff to you...<br><br>... by using big words you don&#39;t know. THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, obviously. The FLUX RATE of the QUANTUM SHORBLDORX is QUIZZINGLY more PLOWDERWALSH than the SNEEPFLOG. Any questions?&quot;<br><br>Iunno, I would have explained this in easy words to begin with instead of dropping the bomb. Aluminium moves heat faster than plastic. Both are colder than you, so aluminium cools your hand down fast, so your nerves say: Wow, that&#39;s cold. The ice is colder, so both plates heat it, but aluminium heats it faster, so it melts. The book doesn&#39;t move heat fast, so you think it&#39;s the same temperature as your body, because there is no fast change in temperature. Books would make good insulation material if you ever got stuck in a library during an apocalypse. The effect of moving heat is called thermal conductivity, because heat (thermos) is being conducted (moved). Here&#39;s some more interesting facts and words. Thank you for your time.<br><br>People tend to shut down when they think they&#39;re not smart enough. That&#39;s the whole thing with science in the public eye. The brain is efficient, so it will just divert its resources to something doable instead. People need to be made aware of how good they are at understanding things by avoiding specific terms and phrasing stuff in a more generally understandable way. Not as in &quot;dumb things down&quot; but as in &quot;ease people into stuff&quot;.<br><br>Here, holding stuff and saying which feels colder, then proving there&#39;s no difference with a thermometer is perfect. People get confused in a positive way as their brains try to figure out what&#39;s happening and why their perception of the world does not align with reality. The brain is struggling to get that &quot;Ahh&quot; effect that happens when they understand that heat flows away from their hand and their senses are not absolute measuring devices. The moment that explanation drops wiki style, they lose that drive.<br><br>I remember that Millionnaire show candidate who totally shut down at an easy maths question. Her brain just never even started to think about that ridiculously trivial question. It was numbers, so she knew she wasn&#39;t good, so she spent all her time blabbing about how much she sucked at maths, instead of just looking at the problem and trying not to solve, but to understand it. That&#39;s the first step. Read the language. Figure out what the question is. It was disappointing because I believe she would&#39;ve solved it if she had tried to. People underestimate their power. Everything is considered magic because it looks so strange. Make people get there by themselves. Show them that it&#39;s understandable, relatable, and that they can do it.", "comment_date": "2017-07-22T12:14:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "unit553", "comment_text": "would you be suprised if i knew that?", "comment_date": "2017-07-21T17:00:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allan Zhu", "comment_text": "I thought this was 6th grade physics :P", "comment_date": "2017-07-20T13:41:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BoredPyro", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been trying to explain this to people for quite a while whenever we talk about temperature, but mostly relating to &quot;real feel&quot; temperatures you hear about on weather reports.

I know that conductivity is due to density and other less important factors and plastic is a chemical composition of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other key elements arranged in different allotropes and that most stable metals are allot higher on the periodic table in terms of atomic number meaning that they have more mass. Iron is alot quicker to transfer heat number one, because the subatomic particles themselves are more dense therefore contains more mass per molecule increasing the total kinetic energy of the partical and number two, the molecular arrangement of the particals, on a molecular level, are more tightly clustered together. In metals, this is usually found in a more uniform fashion.<br><br>I know because of videos, books, articles, classes and school that iron contains more mass and is more densely packed than plastic on both an atomic and molecular scale.<br><br>Yet most of these people are a bit clueless.

Essentially it&#39;s really only things that make you physically colder that feel cold to you. The reason then that the aluminum feels colder to you is because the aluminum is better at absorbing thermal energy (heat), which means that it draws the heat away from your hand and makes you colder faster than the plastic.
