But it&#39;s not true.  Never was.  You once said that the biggest deception in mankind is our immortality, because it comforts us to think we will always be here.  I believe the biggest deception in mankind is that there is no God to answer to, and people believe that to comfort themselves.  Einstein, arguably the smartest man to ever live was a believer.  When the CMB picture seemed to show a predetermined placement of Earth, Hubble said &quot;Therefore, in order to restore homogeneity, and to escape the horror of a unique position, the departures from uniformity, which are introduced by the recession factors.....&quot;  I believe it was called Hubbles Horror, and he seemed distraught that the evidence did seem to imply we were at the center of the universe, although I could be mistaken about some of the details and that is just a small excerpt.  Darwin  could not be a believer because of the grief of the loss of his daughter, and was looking for some other explanation when he penned evolution, which he never seemed to stop having doubts of.  Science proves a Creator for His creatures, it does not disprove it.  The same evidence can be observed by two separate persons, and they will interpret it completely different based almost explicitly on the individuals past experiences, present beliefs, and expected (hoped for) outcome.  I&#39;m sorry, but your religion is not observable, not repeatable, not believable.  It&#39;s only a theory, and a destructive one.   Expanding of the universe - Isaiah 45:12 &quot;I stretched out the heavens with my hands&quot;  The Earth in space - Job 26:7 He hangs the Earth on nothing, and there are many other examples that show extraordinary things in the bible, like the relationship between light and sound, the importance of blood and how it holds information, diseases and how they spread, etc.  I pray that the LORD will &quot;draw you&quot; to Him.
