Unfortunately the set up of that experiment could be challenging. <br>But on the other hand I think that an opposite demonstration would be more interesting, proving your point by a negation. If there will be no penetration of a block at all (neglecting energy of the bullet disintegration) the angular momentum would be about 50% of energy of linear momentum, as you said. In that case, I suppose that we would clearly see a difference in blocks trajectory height. Such block could be made of steel or some other hard but not so brittle material.

The gyroscope holding the block on course vertically so that the energy used to throw the block shot in the middle would toss it off to one side, is not wasted in the spinning of the block. Therefore the spinning block has the potential to go higher. But then I considered that physics would dictate that the block would go the same height because both blocks have the same mass. A piece of wood and a piece of lead. So I said the same height. However, one would have to consider that both blocks have the potential to be microscopically difference in density and therefore that factor needs to be measured into this equation. However kinetic energy is lost at impact, so this slows down the block. <br><br>How can it be measurable?<br><br>Make and use a block that can only be exactly the same density every time or use a perfectly round ball of equal mass to each ball. A round ball of equal mass would have to be made out of a controllable substance. It could not be made of wood. It would have to be a material that would react the exact same way every time it is shot. So perhaps a piece of plastic. <br><br>I am sure if you weigh those blocks, they would be different weights.They are exactly the same size but each one could be off in weight due to decisty of the wood as it grew. An older tree with more rings would have the potential to be heavier than a young tree of the same size. A cut from the same board might be more dense if a tree branch grew out of it at one point and not another. This is assuming you are using the same type of wood for each block.

Momentum is a vector. The bullet is flying horizontally and the wood flies upward. But of course the momentum is preserved because the contraption the wood block is attached is part of the system and the Earth that contraption is secured on is part of the system. And naturally the Earth has much more mass than the wood block. Think of a basketball when you dribble it. The momentum flips over at every bounce. How is it preserved if it is a vector. Because the ball is bouncing from the Earth. The momentum of the total system ball + earth is preserved at every bounce. <br><br>2. Using conservation of energy by just looking at the energy of the wood block is also wrong. I believe most of the energy of the bullet turns into heat at impact. You can verify it by measuring the mass and the speed of the bullet and mass and speed of the wood block.<br><br>In short, you are not looking at the total system when you try to set up and explain the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy equations. You are ignoring the momentum exchange with the earth and the heat energy generated at impact. This system cannot be explained with the simplistic and partial systems approach in this video.

Your explanation states an expected penetration difference of about one percent to explain the same peak height but in the scene just before you present a comparatively huge penetration difference as if it were the solution. Furthermore your simulation shows a slightly curved pathway in the off center shot so Id probably expect more than the stated 1% penetration difference considering only the height of the block and not the actual length of the &quot;penetration tunnel&quot; (although I recognize that this difference might very likely be negligible considering the bullet speed and its deacceleration compared to the rotational speed/acceleration ... nevertheless this simulation is misleading). Also, your 8 videos at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLYoyLcdGPc&amp;t=4m30s\">4:30</a> show a peak height that differs by about 20%.

Here is the correct answer.  When the bullet strikes the block off-center, the block begins to spin.  As the block begins to spin, the block acts as a lever and the nail pushes downward against the plexiglass stand.  The plexiglass structure sits on solid ground, so as the nail pushes downward against it, the effective result is the nail is helping to launch the block upward (just as anything that gives the earth a downward shove will itself experience an upward acceleration).  To prove my theory, you can do the experiment again, removing the plexiglass stand at the exact moment of bullet contact (I&#39;m not sure how this could be done).  Or more easily you could suspend the block using a squishy support structure instead of the rigid plexiglass. If you do this the result will be much different, and the spinning block will not go as high as the non-spinning block.", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T07:50:56Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Damian Green", "comment_text": "To determine exactly how the energy is being transferred from a bullet to a catch material, everything in the experiment needs to be controlled much more tightly. The bullet needs to be of consistent mass and accelerated to a consistent velocity every time (maybe using electromagnetics.) Both the bullet and the catching material need to be much more consistent. Different catching materials should be used, including non-deformative materials that would have an elastic collision with the bullet. The initial momentum of the bullet and the mass of the catching material can vary as long as it remains consistent with each bullet and catch-material combination.  Perform the experiment in a vacuum and measure temperatures before and after. In the end,  a conservation of energy must be observed. <br>However, going back to the original experiment of just using wood, we saw that there was great variation in results between the few repetitions that were done.  This indicates that many many more repetitions need to be done before we can calculated an average height for both the non-rotating blocks and the rotating blocks separately.  I suspect that after a large number of repetitions, we would see a more apparent difference in average height of the rotating blocks with respect to the non-rotating blocks. Because the bullet translates all of its momentum to the wood in the first fraction of a second, it will lodge itself into the wood to a depth that is nearly the same in both rotational cases, I suspect that the energy lost to friction and heat will also be roughly equal in both cases. The fact that so much energy is being translated into angular momentum is very likely to result in the over all average height of the rotating blocks to be less than the non-rotating blocks. <br>Unfortunately, I think Derek&#39;s presentation of the analysis of this riddle is misleading (that the blocks of wood reach the same height in both cases) because the performance of his own experiment was incomplete and led to invalid results.

So no knots, cut side by side from one and the same piece of wood. Use a drill press and drill a hole with a forstner bit in the center, pop in a corresponding bearing, slide onto a shaft, shoot one in middle and one on the end, xray and water jet cut..

When bullet gets stuck in the wood the centre of mass of the entire system lowers in both the cases. And also, the system always rotates about its centre of mass, in the second case, which lies in the fourth quadrant with respect to the centre of the block. Let&#39;s test all the hypotheses and this theory by using basic physics. <br><br>So if we say that the centre of block reaches the same height at the highest point doesn&#39;t imply that centre of mass of the system reaches the same height.  There is some energy loss due to inelastic collision, but let&#39;s assume it is insignificant as X -Ray shows bullet reaches the same depth. (Will come at it later)<br><br>On applying linear momentum conservation, the centre of mass would have same initial velocities and would indeed reach the same height, which would mean that at some instant or permutation, due to rotation, the centre of rotating block would even be higher than the non rotating one, but we observe that in very favourable cases it reaches at most the height of 1st block. This would imply that the centre of mass stays lower than the non rotating block, but that&#39;s impossible since that would imply that linear momentum is not conserved. So premise of different heights of centre of mass is not possible and both have same initial kinetic energies, so the observation that centre of the block reaches the same height is wrong, and it must be the difference in amount of heat dissipated to account for additional rotational energy, implying different bullet depths (That&#39;s what the video says) <br><br>So my conclusion is, all the three options to the original question are correct, since we are observing the centre of the block, which keeps rotating with respect to the centre of mass of the system, which in this case reaches the same height so the centre of the rotating block will always be within plus minus  (r-h) units of the centre of first block, where r is the offset of centre of block with respect to the centre of mass of the 2nd system and h is the vertical offset.

If you use say a block which is a meter in length compared to what that seems like a 10cm length block in the video, and shoot the block such that the bullet hits as far away from the centre of mass as possible, what that will mean is that for the block to continue with the same upwards linear momentum as that of the block shot in the centre, the bullet in the block hit on the edge would need to have a lot less energy lost due to heat/penetration and sound because in order to spin the block you would need more energy and torque.

It caused the safe door locking rods to strike the cabinet. <br><br>In comparison the last most powerful round did not move the whole door noticeably at all. It did not depress or dent the metal on the face of the door that was struck. <br><br>Having shot perhaps 100,000 thousand rounds and projectiles in my life, I have noted phenomena of velocity, that have almost gotten myself and others hurt. Very unforeseen violent reactions have occurred when only small differences in placement of the round upon a target occurred. After seeing it the explanation is usually a simple one, however unforeseen. <br><br>I believe that is where most of the effect is being creating. The wood is absorbing much of the motion of the round upon destruction in both cases. <br><br>Because the wood is giving, and obviously the spinning wood gives way or moves more than the wood that does not spin. The wood is equalizing the effect to some extent. <br><br>Consider shooting an aluminum soda can with a high and low velocity round. The low velocity round, can put a hole into the can and a hole out of the can and throw the can off a shelf. A higher velocity round can leave the can solid upon a shelf after putting a hole into the can and another hole as it exits the can. <br><br>The variables are too great to take any exacting conclusion away from this experiment. <br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>William McCormick", "comment_date": "2017-05-05T01:46:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "elnino rosario", "comment_text": "take a clay like material instead of wood .. or even soft material!!!! so that the penetration is visible..... you can even take thinner bullets", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T06:58:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucky Rabbit", "comment_text": "i just noticed derpy at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLYoyLcdGPc&amp;t=1m33s\">1:33</a>", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T01:14:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vishva Kumara", "comment_text": "use larger bullets of Styrofoam ans a less powerful gun to make the penetration longer and measurable in difference..", "comment_date": "2017-05-03T18:59:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bal\u00e1zs G\u00e9za K\u00e1d\u00e1r", "comment_text": "I think the rotating blocks generating lift.

Balsa wood also has a fairly uniform soft texture, so it should be able to be replicatable between experiments. Using metal plates on the front and back of the block will give it extra mass to cause the moment of inertia to be increased. This will increase the rotational energy, while decreasing the lift height so as to allow the rotating block to spin away from the bullet faster, causing it to lodge in the block sooner, and thereby penetrate less than the block shot in the center. This would seem to me to be the best chance of finding out if it is the penetrative depth that correlates with the spin rather that some other force acting upon the block. This could also be tested more by shooting blocks in different places and finding a linear equation that predicts the rotations per second by measuring the mass of the bullet, the initial velocity as it exits the barrel of the gun, the distance of the impact from the center of the block, and the mass of the block. it would need three shots minimum on identically set up blocks of same mass, bullets that are measure to be exactly the same weight and have the same amount of propellant, and then replicated three or more times with different mass blocks to measure as a variable in the equation to account for the inertia in heavier blocks. <br><br>In this setup, I predict that the heavier the block, the faster the block will spin due to the moment of inertia on the side that was not hit as there is a larger mass to lift than the lighter blocks. Granted, there should be equal inertial force on blocks of different masses, but I have an inkling of a feeling that the rotations per second may be reliant on whether the block is able to transfer the energy through the Mould effect, thereby increasing the rpm by using a &#39;whipping&#39; action by driving one side up while the other side stays motionless. <br><br>Please let me know what you think of this, I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this.", "comment_date": "2017-05-03T17:29:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Doug Vallette", "comment_text": "Thank you for this video sequence!

Wood was used. even if a piece of wood cut from the same 2x4 can have different densities, grain patterns, and overall mass. <br>2. Ammunition and firearm (my area of interest). The type of round used looked like a .22 caliber. All ammunition is inconsistent to a certain degree, but 22&#39;s are known to be more so. If a semi auto rifle was used, the gas blowback used to open the bolt is also inconsistent. <br> Now of course there wasn&#39;t any creation of energy lol. I simply belive the kinetic energy that was transfered from the projectile was dispersed in different ways. when shot in the center, the energy has room to evenly move throughout the block giving vertical and slight rotational motion. The block shot to the side had the same force but  though instead of the majority of energy dispersing evenly throughout the block over the same time,  instead it was distributing energy through 2 axis. I can only think of 2 possible reasons for the hight being similar. the first, as gravity, air density, teperature etc... remained constant, and everything else was somewhat consistent other than exact locations of shot placement, and items i meantioned earlier. having additional time in the vertical position would likely yield different results. or perform the experiment at a location that would allow the blocks of wood to reach terminal velocity, and measure the time it takes for each block to hit the ground and extrapolate the result from there. the objects going higher would hit the ground last.<br>the only other thing I can think of is caused from the magnus effect. but I&#39;m not sure if it works with blocks of wood.", "comment_date": "2015-09-12T09:06:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Askalin Jaskalander", "comment_text": "Can it also be due to bernaulis principle or Magnus effect", "comment_date": "2015-09-11T11:35:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IkaSensei", "comment_text": "Omg, I was right!

The problem here is that there could be some difference in the amount of energy spent splattering the projectile all over the place. That might be hard to measure.<br><br>To measure differences given the current set up (wood blocks), how about measuring the volume of the hole the bullets create. The bullets might not travel straight in the wood, they could tumble. Whether tumbling or not, some energy in the bullet will be spent creating the hole in the wood.

I would measure what I put into the hole - so start with say 100 cc of liquid and find out how much liquid is left when the hole is filled.<br><br>If you used water, the wood will absorb some part of the water, so some liquid that won&#39;t be absorbed would be good. The geek in me would suggest mercury, but that&#39;s pretty nasty to handle. An oil might not absorb as quickly as water.

The force is vertically upwards since the axle-supporting surface is flat and horizontal, and the point of application of force is offset from the vertical line passing through the center of mass of the bullet-block system. Well, of course the axle applied an equal and opposite reaction on the supporting surface the exact same time, but we don&#39;t have to worry about that; when analyzing a system, we have to look at force applied ON the system, not by the system.<br>There are two things going on here, which I believe, like other things in this video, are enlightening..<br>1. This force applied by the supporting surface on the bullet-block system alleviates any momentum conservation that does not count the supporting surface (and the surface stands and the earth and so on...) as a part of the system for which the conservation has to be applied. Not even the linear momentum conservation that we easily applied to compare/calculate height to which the blocks rose. This force is what takes the block higher above than our own intuition would allow it to rise.<br>2. The force is also the reason for a torque on the bullet-block system. However, as our intuition would have it, the torque is oriented so that it would rotate the bullet-block system clockwise. But the bullet-block system actually rotate counterclockwise, as seen in the video! That means, if it were not for the supporting surface, the bullet-block system would rotate much more rapidly, since then there would be no clockwise torques to slow or down!

NOW, in the &quot;off center&quot; shot a moment was created focusing energy that lifted the block, and the potential energy stored by the opposing half of the off center block was transformed into kinetic energy by the force of gravity. Had the other side of the block opposite of where the bullet hit been kept from moving in the downward direction then the test may have had a different outcome.

In a way that was true, but it wasn&#39;t the energy of the bullet that added this energy. As the block was lifted off the ground to it&#39;s resting place it had gathered potential energy. So as the bullet side was lifted the potential energy on the opposing side of the block, having no restriction transformed it&#39;s potential energy into kinetic energy as gravity pulled it down.

Now, if the side opposite of the side impacted by the bullet were supported and the force of gravity providing a moment, then it would be interesting to see how high the block went.<br><br>Next, I guess you would have had to notice that the center of the rotation was NOT at the center of the block.

And in fact, if the bullet had hit at he very end of the wood then almost exactly half the weight of the block, and it&#39;s potential energy from gravity was converted just into the spinning forces.

Since kinetic energy is \u00bd*m*sqr(v), even a small change in v will have a profound effect on energy. A rifle and a bullet is extremely crude way of conducting such a scientific experiment.

The key difference is that more work is required to slow the bullet in the first case (when the bullet hits the block head-on) than in the second case. And, assuming similar internal shear forces within the block, the bullet will be lodged deeper when it hits head on versus when it hits near one of the sides. This difference in work/internal heat generation arises from the fact that when the bullet hits head on, the block is prohibited from rotating because no net moment is generated, meaning that the bullet must be slowed to the actual linear velocity of the center of mass of the block. However, when the bullet hits off-center, the bullet only needs to be slowed to the linear velocity of the block PLUS the Omega-R velocity of its distance from the block&#39;s center of gravity. This means that the kinetic energy that the bullet loses is actually different in the two cases (it loses less energy in the rotating case).\u00a0 The two systems (rotating and non-rotating) actually end up with two different final energy levels, even though they began with the same energy level and have identical linear kinetic energies. The bullet travels deeper into the non-rotating block, and so more of the initial kinetic energy is dissipated into heat. Less energy dissipation occurs in the rotating block, which is why the presence of its nonzero rotational kinetic energy does not violate conservation laws.

The lift(or lack there of) compensates for the amount of energy used. where as shooting in the middle means a more constant or even draw on the amount of momentum it taxes from the bullet to provide lift its more equally heavy on both sides which is why it doesn&#39;t have to spin to reach its height(again, or lack there of).
