More accurately what must be happening is that when Ben tugs the string, it stops the downward motion effectively crashing the spool and string into each other. This sudden exertion causes friction which binds the string to the bottom of the spool. That spot on the string then turns with the spin of the Y-Yo going up the back side, over the top, and then down the front -- which then causes the spin to be going up in relation to the string. So when Derek goes on to explain that if you watch closely you can see when the string binds to the spool, that isn&#39;t correct because he&#39;s filming from the wrong side. The moment he describes is when the string coming to the front loops back on itself to start the upward journey, and is a full 3/4 turn after the actual catch takes place.", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T16:54:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rory McLeod", "comment_text": "Dang that was tight.
