Highly unlikely, agreed, but still a possibility.<br><br>Personally, I have never felt comfortable and natural with Einstein&#39;s postulate that light travels at the same speed in all frames and the idea of a light clock. One simple reason has been it is not a naturally symmetric postulate - how do we even know clock goes slow and which one goes fast - resolution of that would require reference to a normal absolute clock or frame of reference. I may be wrong, and I know there exists an complex and non-trivial explanation to the previous, but again, it is a postulate not a law - and postulate is just a fancy term for a baggage of assumptions. So, it can be contested, like am doing right now - and I am doing this because it is not totally mathematically elegant construct, and requires so much of fine print explanation. <br><br>It all depends upon what is defined as what, and what are recognized as rigid and which malleable. If we were to revisit everything with respect to an absolute time and an absolute clock, we might have a different understanding of nature, whether it helps in our immediate needs or long term needs would be a different matter altogether, but it is good that people are realising that science in it current form is not capturing reality as it is, but high fidelity projections of reality from various different perspectives and trying to sew together a story which is consistent, and helps in making predictions in the future with higher and higher certainty. And the scientific process is about discovering new perspectives and capturing new projections which have higher and/or more general fidelity with lesser exceptions or breaking points. <br><br>In science, we seek broadly seek causation and ability to predict with formulae (What makes apple fall to the ground? And now can we predict and predetermine all falls with greatest precision?), and in religion/traditions we seek correlations (It is ok to eat apple, people do not usually die by eating apple. It is ok to believe in God and use this construct (sound like postulate, aha moment!) to live a pious and moral life, like my family or the pastor did by believing in God. Maybe it is all ok, for all the people to choose their own set of belief or postulates, as long as they are not imposed upon others with coercion.) <br><br>Both causation or correlations sit on thin ice, and have their own breaking points under their own weight. What is the right way to know what is better for doing an enquiry about nature and/or living a life? Who am I to judge? What do I know? Who does? You do. <br><br>Did not want to hurt your scientific or religious sentiments. Or did I? Ok, I wanted to hurt both you by an equal amount. Peas. Sorry for being a dk - but this is what I feel.<br><br>PS : When you have time do try to reflect upon : what is more important to be scrutinized, the logical conclusions or the assumption based on which the logical conclusions are made. When things break on the limits, it is usually when assumptions do get challenged, lead to a new set of assumptions which lead to a new logical interpretation of the reality, with its own breaking point, which get discovered later.", "comment_date": "2018-12-03T23:04:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "selador11", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t light speed slowing down?
