It needs the magnesium found in the soil to create chlorophyll. It also uses other minor ionic metals that could not be found in... the air, or in light. The first process in photosynthesis uses water. It breaks a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen (the oxygen is then removed from the plant with all due haste; as it is a deadly toxin to a later part of the process.) If the plant did not have a supply of water, the plant would be unable to complete the first part of photosynthesis, and it would die. The first part of photosynthesis also involves light.

The process autotrophs use to create nutrient materials is called photosynthesis. It involves taking the CO2 we breathe out, combining it with solar energy and water. With those 3 components coming together, the autotrophs create nutrient materials(chlorophyll, starch, etc.) and release oxygen, which is one of the gasses we use in the breathing process, typically the inhaling. So what I&#39;m saying is, the heterotroph and the autotroph are in a symbiosis, with the heterotrophs exhaling CO2, which the autotrophs use to create O2. Back to the trees, that chlorophyll they create is usually stored in their plants, but unfortunately they create more than they can store in the plants so they store it inside them instead. That is a part of how trees get their mass, because there is a lot of water flowing through the stem which is necessary for the photosynthesis process to occur, and it&#39;s also the way trees get minerals and nutrient materials from the soil (Root &gt;&gt; Stem &gt;&gt; Branches &gt;&gt; Leaves).

I have been wondering where trees get their mass for years, I never thought of CO2 for some reason.<br><br>I have a similar question: How can a grassy field maintain its life year after year indefinitely? You would think that having all those little grass plants crammed in together like that, they would use up all the nutrients in the soil and die off. If they live off the dead grass from the year before, how can that be sustainable, surely some nutrients are being lost constantly.
