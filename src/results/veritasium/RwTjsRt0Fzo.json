But the positive particles are most likely ions.<br>* cold plasma light is mostly due to recombination.  It is wildly incorrect to say that the plasma glows because of its temperature.  This is true of black bodies that are in thermodynamic equilibrium which is totally not the case in a cold plasma like the one you have here (electrons have huge energies and ions are barely above room temp)  (I did the Wien&#39;s approx estimate anyhow, and assuming a cold plasma electron temperature of 2eV, you easily have radiation in the ultraviolet, invisible to humans... anyways, I don&#39;t think the black body formula applies) In high temperature plasmas you have Breemsthralung radiation from the collisions of electrons with ions and that is very broadband, including the visible. Yet this radiation is very small compared to line radiation which is why you see light here.", "comment_date": "2019-02-19T08:48:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L P", "comment_text": "Anybody here?", "comment_date": "2019-02-19T08:25:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Taylor", "comment_text": "This was 7 years ago....<br><br>And now the follow up was posted 7 hours ago.

The first thing we tried was a lit candle.  Because we didn&#39;t care too much about the oven itself we allowed the balls of plasma to sit against the ceiling of the chamber as they formed. <br><br>  Although the results we got were encouraging, it was actually not that easy to ignite a plasma directly from a paraffin flame. In addition to the heat damage we noticed some soot had also been deposited on the oven&#39;s ceiling. <br><br>  After that we tried pieces of aluminum foil in various shapes; sheets, crumpled balls, two pieces separated by a small gap, etc.  The arcs drawn between aluminum objects were blue-white and very sporadic. They were also confined the surface of the foil, not producing detached plasma.<br><br>  After that we tried just lighting small pieces of wood or charring larger pieces with a torch this produced the best results.  It seems to be easiest to form carbon plasma from materials with a lot of free carbon like charcoal.  Water solutions of ionic compunds did not do anything interesting. Dry binary salts may melt but I wouldn&#39;t count on plasma. <br><br>  I have heard that if you heat a section of a piece of glass and place it in the oven before it has a chance to cool the increased conductivity of the hot area will draw the most RF energy and continue being heated further until you eventually melt the entire object. Although I have never done this with a microwave I have accomplished it using an arc drawn from a neon sign transformer.  Hot glass and quartz are indeed electrically conductive. I have, in fact, welded broken glass back together by drawing an arc through the crack between them.  Starting out with the electrodes on either side of the crack a hot spot is formed at the boundary and then as one is moved along the crack in one direction and the other in the other direction, the entire joint becomes conductive enough to concentrate the current and dissipate enough heat to melt and fuse.", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T11:07:10Z", "likes_count": 50}, {"comment_by": "Ashley Terer", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve tried it, now I can&#39;t stop.", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T16:39:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "theshamanist", "comment_text": "I looked this up cause I put a grape in the microwave and it scarred the crap out me", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T12:21:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AVA FlamezZ", "comment_text": "spam", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T04:41:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AVA FlamezZ", "comment_text": "plassmanutz", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T04:40:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AVA FlamezZ", "comment_text": "gigidi", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T04:39:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dash711", "comment_text": "Im not gay or bi but Derek looks great whether or not he has or doesn&#39;t have a beard", "comment_date": "2016-06-16T00:20:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hecho En M\u00e9xico", "comment_text": "theres gas in grapes?", "comment_date": "2016-06-14T14:59:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syed Raziuddin", "comment_text": "learned a new word today.............", "comment_date": "2016-06-14T09:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "onehit pick", "comment_text": "In my micro, the plasma was sustained for as long as I left the microwave on (&gt;20 seconds) and was trapped in the top.
