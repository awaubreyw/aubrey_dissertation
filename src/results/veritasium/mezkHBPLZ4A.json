So, maybe wind (or forces that cause wind) should be the fifth force?  <br>I believe electron attraction might be holding the AGs to the Earth.

For one, that would be more related to electromagnetic force due to like or different charges causing them to attract. Such Formula for this is very very similar to Newtons Law of Graviation. In the most strictest sense however, gravity is the effect that a body of mass has on the universe, IE spacetime. The gravitational constant is the universal constant that a body of mass has on the universe, or rather how much it stretches it. For example if you have a blanket with a grid lined pattern all around it, with all of it being equal distance. Introducing a mass or a pull on the blanket will cause the distance between the fibers to stretch which is why in black holes, the mass of it causes time to slow and space to expand. Similarly, if you do this with a blanket, such similar effect will happen visually. There is always a force acting on the universe if a body has mass which is called gravity. However, in the most relaxed sense, gravity is a cause of the mass of the planet along side the centripetal force that the earth exerts.
