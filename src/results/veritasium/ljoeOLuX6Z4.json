What we even know, and are continuing to learn, in regards to the incomprehensible amount of &quot;uknowns&quot; still just blows me away. The mathematical discovery of Neptune by  Urbain Le Verrier is the first example that pops into my head. When I first saw the Hubble Deep Field image and then watched the 3D simulation separating the image to scale,  and in comparison to its distance to our own galaxy, I must&#39;ve sat staring at my screen unable to say or think anything but &quot;............uh....wow.....uh.....How do people see this and just say &quot;Wow, cool&quot; and aren&#39;t changed even a little bit. Astronomy really did more to help me be a better and more understanding person than anything else in this life. We are so insignificantly significant in terms of the sheer scale of the Universe, and our CURRENT understanding we  MAY be the only conscious lifeforms (doubtful) - the fact we even still wage war and can&#39;t take care of our one and only Home and Eachother really just becomes so sad to wake up to each and every sacred day we get. We&#39;d rather Nero decree the one celestial body that harbors life (again, as far as we know) under Mutual Assured Destruction than begin to establish a future in which both Planet and Inhabitants are cared for for the insignificantly significant existence we get (as far as we know) 1 shot at. When all is said and done, in the end, leaving the world a better place in which you found it is to me, the closest answer to the question of &quot;Why are we?&quot; we have been asking since we started casting our gaze up to the stars in search of meaning. Idk how we ever got so lost as a species that being a better person each day to each other and our home is regarded as irrelevant if you don&#39;t believe in a certain theology. I&#39;m 100000% certain no matter what we meet when our time is done, being a decent human being is regarded more highly than the name you believe in through the name your pray through. It was never meant to be like this.  How did we just become &quot;okay&quot; with establishing an existence in which we spend the majority of it preparing for the end of it. We got so focused on trying to build a life that we actually don&#39;t even live. Imagine telling mankind in hindsight of all the wonders of the Universe in which we reside, and convincing everyone &quot;Ya, but we established an existence in which we spend the majority of it lwaging war, living in poverty, in which tax cuts to those who have accumulated more wealth than 90% of the world&#39;s population are more important than making sure people don&#39;t go to bed hungry. Living and dying in the same little corner of the planet you grew up in because we &quot;don&#39;t have time to just.....&quot; due to the virtuous suffering we decided to admire and establish as the &quot;norm&quot;.

I am for awhile, I go back n fourth out this world into the real universe which you would call simulation which everything is the real world. That I control and Made, I came back from 2143 and I am here to stop the holy war, and World War III about break out and then Robot war which in history from AI and then finally Alien war from hollow earth inside this earth is aliens with this same machine that is here. Thanks I would like to send you my visual of my thoughts to show you what I want to make. mass emp machine to shut off all robots in 2141 if world needs to shut them down due to AI, How long to make massive EMP for space&gt; I can send you my visual", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T05:39:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CiurkitboyN", "comment_text": "They all look like faces", "comment_date": "2022-02-22T00:44:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Sutton", "comment_text": "2 supernova per galaxy per century?

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed.

Is it other gravitational lenses that focuses the light back down in our direction for hubble to see or is that just the normal behavior of light to just go up and over that lens?", "comment_date": "2021-09-12T00:03:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allison Palaganas", "comment_text": "I only watch these kind of videos not because I understand it but I need to sleep", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T16:05:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Odious One", "comment_text": "(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljoeOLuX6Z4&amp;t=6m26s\">6:26</a>)  The universe is saying &quot;Have a nice day!&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T15:57:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MonkeyOnABicycle", "comment_text": "I just need to wait hundred thousand years to see that", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T04:37:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moises Aspres", "comment_text": "Geez, everyone I know, myself included, seems so stupid to me...it blows my mind that there are humans among us smart enough to map the characteristics of a gravitational lens.

Als we naar een stelsel kijken met 50% roodverschuiving kijken we naar een stelsel dat atomen heeft die een 2 maal zo grote diameter hebben en daardoor een lagere frequentie uitzenden als we dan volgens de Constante van Hubble even aan nemen dat dat licht er bijna 7 miljard jaar over gedaan heeft, om ons te bereiken, betekend dat, dat we in bijna 7 miljard jaar zijn gehalveerd in diameter en ons klokje 2 maal zo snel is gaan lopen, als je dit alles op de afstand Aarde Zon toe past blijkt dat we 10 meter per jaar ons van de Zon af bewegen en het dan lijkt, dat daardoor de ijstijden zijn ontstaan.", "comment_date": "2021-08-01T10:36:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin willemse", "comment_text": "You do have redshift, but the question is whether those galaxies really move away from us, it could also be that our atoms shrink and cause the redshift, the best evidence would be if we look at the Moon, which is removed they move away from the Earth just like galaxies, if you apply Hubble&#39;s Constant to it you arrive at 2 cm per year, but they thought 100 years ago that the tidal forces are responsible for that, but that doesn&#39;t seem right to me , if the tidal wave that causes the Moon on Earth only pulls the Moon harder and the Moon would get a smaller orbit around the Earth, then that wave would be slightly ahead of the Moon because the Earth rotates in the same direction as the Moon and if the Moon would revolve a little faster around the Earth, that is not what we observe, we see the Moon moving further and further away from the Earth, there is only 1 explanation for this and that is that our atoms shrink, then it seems that the Moon is moving away from the Earth while the Moon is actually moving closer to the Earth, but the shrinking atoms are a greater force than the attractive force of the tidal wave, the force of the tidal wave is compensated by the force on the other side of the The Earth created a tidal wave and would pull the Moon towards the Earth from a height of a few millimeters. The Moon then revolves more slowly around the Earth, because when atoms shrink our time runs faster.

One of the \r<br>most heated debates relates to the action between two bodies distant from each other (the \r<br>gravitational attraction), and to what extent Newton involved God in this case. Practically, most \r<br>of the papers discuss four types of gravitational attractions in the case of remote bodies: direct \r<br>distance action as intrinsic property of bodies in epicurean sense; direct remote action divinely \r<br>mediated by God; remote action mediated by a material ether; or remote action mediated by an \r<br>immaterial ether. The purpose of this paper is to argue that Newton categorically rejected the types \r<br>of direct action as the intrinsic property of bodies, and remote action mediated by a material ether. \r<br>Concerning the other two types of action, direct through divine intervention and mediated through \r<br>an immaterial environment, Newton has repeatedly stated that he does not know the exact cause \r<br>of gravity, but in both cases, he has directly involved God, directly in the first case and as the \r<br>primary cause (the environment/ether being the secondary cause) in immaterial mediated action. \r<br>But since recognition of direct distance action could have given some credit to those who thought \r<br>gravity could be essential to matter, and hence to atheism, Newton never openly acknowledged \r<br>the possibility of such an idea. Towards the end of his life, Newton leaned more toward a remote \r<br>action mediated by an immaterial ether. In the argumentation of this opinion, I turned to the works \r<br>of Andrew Janiak, Eric Schliesser John Henry, Hylarie Kochiras and Steffen Ducheyne.", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T04:36:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MZ TECH", "comment_text": "Issac newton on the action  at a distance on gravity: with or without god", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T04:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dabiiiid", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who thought betelgeuse was spelled as beetle juice?", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T04:09:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach Young", "comment_text": "Newton to Bentley, 1693", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T04:00:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Lloclla Cardenas", "comment_text": "this just remind me, what are we in this vast universe?", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T03:26:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "hercules71185", "comment_text": "I think you should try to defeat the youtube algorithm.

With the three earlier letters as his guide, Bentley makes the following estimation of Newton&#39;s understanding of the possibility that gravity could somehow be an essential feature of material bodies:</i><br><br><i>&quot;And as for gravitation, tis impossible that that should either be co\u00e6ternal &amp; essential to matter, or ever acquired by it. Not essential and co\u00e6ternal to matter; for then even our system would have been eternal (if gravity could form it) against our atheist&#39;s supposition &amp; what we have proved in our last. For let them assign any given time, that matter convened from a chaos into our system, they must affirm that before the given time matter gravitated eternally without convening, which is absurd. {Sir, I make account, that your courteous suggestion by your last, that a chaos is inconsistent with the hypothesis of innate gravity, is included in this paragraph of mine.} and again, tis unconceivable, that inanimate brute matter should (without a divine impression) operate upon &amp; affect other matter without mutual contact: as it must, if gravitation be essential and inherent in it.&quot;</i><br><br><i>In reply to this letter, Newton refers back to this second proposition, making one of the most famous of all his pronouncements concerning the possibility of action at a distance:</i><br><br><i>&quot;The last clause of the second position I like very well. It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact, as it must be, if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe innate gravity to me.</i> <b><del>That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.</del></b> <i>Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left open to the consideration of my readers&quot;</i>", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T16:23:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Wilkie", "comment_text": "All is vibration, the qualitive reciprocal of what precision mathematical Intuition identifies as a &quot;trivial zero&quot;, and is self-defining unity-tangency of Singularity, or Spheroidal-Toroidal 1-0 duality of zero-infinity positioning, Unit Circularity, in this holographic Modulation function, time-timing cause-effect.<br><br>The apparent acceleration of expansion of information from remote e-Pi-i sync-duration timing interference positioning resonance such a triviality related to integration-deratives of zero-infinity positioning S-T &quot;atomic&quot; holes in superposition spin-spiral logarithmic shaping/ timing.

To result the calculation in a faster expension, you must take both things in consideration, but all popularizers only explains it with the distance, not with time. Could you please make a video someday that explains the calculation between time and distance of galaxies that are receiding away because they are red shifted? Here is what I suppose: The older (further) galaxies are more red shifted than younger (closer) galaxies because in the past (further away), the universe was expending faster then today, so the universe expension is slowing.

But if it were to turn out that a significant portion of type Ia supernovae result from collisions between two white dwarfs instead - which could result in a whole range of potential luminosities due to the combined mass being able to significantly exceed the Chandrasekhar limit - then wouldn&#39;t that break their utility as a standard candle and everything that depends on that, including measurements of the cosmic expansion rate?

I mean Just one example is our Sun(which makes up 99.86% of our solar systems mass) is approximately 93  million miles away (which is 1 Astronomical Unit, from center of earth to center of sun) and light takes roughly 8 minutes to reach us and the Sun converts 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596 million tons of helium every second! in a constant battle of equilibrium with gravity that it will eventually lose.  Now lets take Beetlegeus for example, as shown is 548 Light years from Earth (Light year is the distance light travels in 1 Earth year= about 6 trillion miles) which is incredible when you realize that outer space is just 62 miles away, Although there is no official solid boundary for where space begins, the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line sits at 62 miles above sea-level and is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties or for aerospace records keeping. But its not just that but the fact A neutron star( Neutron stars are formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses and can spin 600 times/sec. The very central region of the star \u2013 the core \u2013 collapses, crushing together every proton and electron into a neutron) is about 20 km in diameter and has the mass of about 1.4 times that of our Sun. This means that a neutron star is so dense that on Earth, one teaspoonful would weigh a billion tons!  Even to the fact that Quasars are the brightest thing in our universe and that stars you see at night could have &quot;gone out&quot; millions of years ago to the fact that supernovas are incredibly powerful, as a matter of fact the most powerful explosion puts the \u201csuper\u201d in supernova. A blast about 4.5 million light-years away has released about 10 times more energy than the sun will emit in its entire lifetime, making it the most powerful supernova ever spotted, named &quot;SN2016aps&quot;. Not only is SN2016aps the most powerful supernova ever spotted, it is the longest one we have found. We found this more than three years ago, and we\u2019re still observing it \u2013 usually we only can track a supernova for maybe a few months, and thats not even scratching the surface.", "comment_date": "2020-10-21T01:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fuseteam \ua9c2", "comment_text": "wait <i>gravitational</i> time dilation for <b>light</b> ?!<br>.........<br><b><i>hOw</i></b>", "comment_date": "2020-10-21T01:18:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Z0L0N", "comment_text": "BAH!

I would just like to remark a small thing. The main reason why we see the SN appear at different times is not the Shapiro delay, that is, not because time flows at a different pace in a stronger gravitational field (that effect does exist, but is not relevant in this context). The delays are simply due to the different length of the curved paths that the light follows from the different images of the SN. As shown very clearly in the graphics in the video, some paths are longer than others, so light takes longer to reach us. In a sense, it&#39;s surprising that the time differences are so small, as it took around 10 billion years for the light to reach us, and the individual flight times only differ by 20 years or so.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:52:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "p p", "comment_text": "ok my mind is fu*ked for tonight", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:50:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Dowse", "comment_text": "Looks like Arthur C Clarke got it right when he wrote:<br>&quot;It&#39;s full of stars.&quot; in 2001: A Space Odyssey<br>That lensing effect must make a tricky job even trickier!  \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:50:16Z", "likes_count": 53}, {"comment_by": "Truce", "comment_text": "a video every week from veritasium, dream", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:49:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fernando Takeshi Sato", "comment_text": "another excellent video, damn Derek is on fire!", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:49:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atharva Johri", "comment_text": "you&#39;re amazing.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:49:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Jensen", "comment_text": "Kind of funny how you suggest lensing means space is not like glass, even though most ordinary lenses are made of glass. <br><br>Great video though.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:48:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lotus_Flowerrr", "comment_text": "ME R  C   H!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:48:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u062e\u064a\u0631 _ \u0623\u0645\u0629", "comment_text": "\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0645.\ud83d\udc9b<br>\u0646\u062d\u0646\u064f \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0650\u0641\u064f \u0628\u0639\u0636\u064e\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0654\u0628\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0650\u0646\u0651\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628\u064e\u0628\u062a\u064f \u0627\u0654\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u062a\u0644\u0642\u0651\u0649 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u064e\u062e\u0635\u064d \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0648\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0631\u060c \u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0642\u0649 \u0623\u0633\u0623\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645  \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0628\u064a\u0636 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0634\u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0642\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u062a\u0633\u0628 \u0648 \u064a\u0634\u0641\u064a \u0645\u0631\u0636\u0627\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0631\u062d\u0645 \u0645\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0648\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0623\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0639\u0637\u064a\u0643 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0647  \u0648\u064a\u062f\u062e\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629 \u0628\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0644\u0642\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u0636\u0627\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0631\u0636\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629  \u0623\u062a\u0645\u0646\u0649 \u0644\u0643 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0621 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0655\u0646\u0634\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0650\u0641\u0651\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0635\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0641\u064f\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u064a\u064f\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0631\u064f\u0648\u062d\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0648\u064a\u064e\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0628\u062a\u0647\u062c \u0642\u062f \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0633\u062e\u0651\u0631\u0646\u064a \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u062a\u064e\u0628\u062a\u0633\u0645 \u0623\u062a\u0645\u0646\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0646\u062c\u064e\u062d\u062a\u064f", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:47:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rokas Rerroca", "comment_text": "So ultimately for us to &quot;see&quot; where we&#39;re going as we travel through space we need to master seeing &quot;through&quot; gravitational distortions?

If he&#39;s right about his hypothesis, then his finding would invalidate the big bang theory. It would be interesting to see this channel Veritasium make a video on Halton Arp findings.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:12:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Segala Nicolas", "comment_text": "Many thanks again for your great videos", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:12:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiberiu Musat", "comment_text": "The title and thumbnail are really bad, wouldn&#39;t have clicked if I didn&#39;t know veritasium.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:12:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wakata", "comment_text": "This is too much for a human brain , this is absolutely beyond amazing ....", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:11:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jobuda10", "comment_text": "Amazing video! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23walkaway\">#walkaway</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2020\">#Trump2020</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:11:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kasper Plougmann", "comment_text": "So, all the starts that I see in the sky are not individual starts but a lot of them are duplicates?", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:11:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vahagn Yengibaryan", "comment_text": "Damn BeetleJuice really has a mega star with his name.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:10:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "guns and kithes", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljoeOLuX6Z4&amp;t=1m48s\">1:48</a> For real , Ive never regretted my short life span THIS FREAKIN MUCH.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:10:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Center of Gravity", "comment_text": "You&#39;re saying that the stars are repeating in the sky because the light is bending?", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T21:09:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcel van der Putten", "comment_text": "The observable Universe is maybe the Same stuff over and over again from different angles and time?
