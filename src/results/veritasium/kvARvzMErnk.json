The good stuff is wood that is very soft, spongy and light and dry. It resembles driftwood a bit, but much softer, kind of like the springyness of packing foam. It will literally burn like a cigarette. All you have to do is hit it for a bit with your magnifying glass to get a small ember going, then add a bit of wind from a breeze or your breath, and presto, fire, baby. The stuff is so good at it that if you have any real wind, it WILL catch fire with just a tiny starter coal growing fast and then igniting. With a little luck you can find large chunks of it everywhere in an uncleared woodland, and just add some to your pack or whatever to keep you well stocked for starting several fires on just a reasonable block about 3&quot; long. Break off a little piece, start an ember on it, and blow on it hard till it ignites.<br><br>When I was a kid, I was an f***in&#39; artist with magnifying lenses and fire, lol.
