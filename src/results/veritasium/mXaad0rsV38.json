I have heard that it&#39;s possible to structure water back into it&#39;s natural form in nature of hexagonal molecules small enough to enter every cell in our body to hydrate &amp; also clear out toxins, and that this natural hexagonal structure is what enables water in nature to form crystal snow flakes in beautiful patterns, if frozen even in a freezer, but that municipal water treatments, add so many harsh chemicals to kill viruses &amp; germs, that they destroy the natural hexagonal molecular structure, instead forming much larger globular molecules of water, too large to penetrate most cells. Dr Moto&#39;s group in Japan proved that under a microscope. And, at their mountain top cabin, the natural spring fed water produced hexagonal crystal shapes like snow flakes when frozen in very thin layers. Municipal city water in Japan, could not produce hexagonal patterns frozen in thin layers. A German researcher, many years ago, observed similar properties of water, and the much greater health effects of naturally structured water from nature, compared to highly treated municipal water, and came up with methods to swirl municipal water, similar to the way that water is swirled with a vortex in nature, in streams, by piping systems that similarly swirl the water, creating a vortex inside the pipes, similar to the way streams do, in a better designed plumbing system both for homes, and for the water supply for commercial crop growing, which has been implemented in industrial farming in Austrailia, with no 90\u00b0 turns in the pipes. That method restructures water back to It&#39;s natural structure of hexagonal molecules, much better absorbed by animals and plants. I recently found out we could restructure our drinking water by simply stirring it in a glass until it forms a vortex, or similarly swirling it in a bottle before drinking. I would like both of you to orchestrate another experiment to discover whether natural streams out in nature in Australia swirl horizontally as they gradually move downward to sea level, (looking from above to below as they do for showing hurricanes and cyclones), clockwise as cyclones in the southern hemisphere do, and if streams in the northern hemisphere swirl in a counterclockwise fashion as hurricanes in the northern hemisphere do. It would seem that they would follow the same patterns, and therefore we ought to swirl our water, similarly counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere as nature does, to restructure it. I&#39;d suggest utilizing underwater lights &amp; non-toxic natural dyes to test streams in nature. Don&#39;t natural water currents in nature, synch in some way with the air currents like counterclockwise hurricanes in the northern hemisphere and clockwise cyclones in the southern hemisphere? <br>Could I be that the power of our swirling is capable of restructuring water to the natural tiny hexagonal molecules capable of entering any cell, say, if we always swirl the water clockwise in our glass or bottle, regardless as to which hemisphere we&#39;re in, as in that case we are acting like a planet acts on it&#39;s water, and being the over riding planetary force on our particular glass or bottle of water.

I wrote this on another blog site but was unable to publish it so I&#39;m dumping this off here for more study and comments.:<br>Wow, my father was a physicist and I remember something about the ??? effect and that it spins one way in the nort.. bla bla.. But I think I have discovered the truth of the matter, now that I know it is open. <br>   My observations over a long time and many long showers with all sorts of settings of the shower, my body and even guiding the water to flow a certain way.<br>   Now I was raised on a sailboat sailing as a 6yo a 24ton dry and about 43 tons wet 56ft Cutter 68ft double diamond rig mast and a 7.5 ft draft. It has been around the world twice before we lived aboard for close to 6 years both Atlantic and Pacific and north and south of the equator... (and for shits sake I went through the now outlawed initiation on an aircraft carrier at sea to become a &quot;Trusty Shellback&quot;) at any rate... gee should I somehow evidence other than this that I may actually have &quot;discovered&quot; revealed to me the true answer?..<br>  So I&#39;m in the shower yet again and recalling how certain other times I have seen the water persistently went one way and other times the other... testing each condition out with my hand held showerhead with various streams, can direct in numerous ways front side and even backwards on the centerline of the tub to see uninfluenced stream at least from the start... to thoroughly verify the effect or lack thereof. So, this morning at 5am in Maryland(outside DC) and this time it is going counterclockwise... so I do my experiments and indeed it favors the counterclockwise direction, even after forcing it to go clockwise it would require constant coercion to keep it going else it would spin the counterclockwise direction.<br>   Now being raised on a sailboat I&#39;m more aware of the sun, pressure, moisture, smell etc... i&#39;ve been called the weatherman because I am able to fairly predict the weather.. kinda helps when you windsurf in storms... So I am a bit more aware of various &quot;spheres of influence&quot; such as the sun, moon, tilt of the axis, magnetic fields, sun bursts, pollen, pollution, temperature etc... So from being on a sailboat I tend to know &quot;instinctively&quot; which way is North... so drum roll please.. at 5am in the summer time (the ark of the Sun is high and wide)and from the east... sun rises in the east... but it sets in the west.. so have you got it yet? the pull of the sun in the early am in summer time when it will be almost directly overhead meaning that it will be due east and due west, it flows one way at sun rise and another at sunset due to the pull of the sun.. So I tested it our tonight and yup clockwise.<br>    If you take into consideration that most tests are done in the daytime probably in the afternoon to evening hours it invariably spun in that direction, but few are up at 4am when it is pulling from another direction.. So I will continue to verify and my suspicion is that it will dissipate as the winter approaches and the sun is consistently in a smaller arch and thus the pull relative to the tub will be constant no matter what time of day or night. <br>   So this makes sense too.. my problem with the ??? Effect of the spin of the earth is like arguing that if you toss a ball in the air it will land in a different spot and always in the direction of rotation or if you are on a train going 100 mph verses 500 mph the effect will increase in the direction of the train... <br>   BUT if you account for the pull of the sun on everything acting like a constant drag since clearly the earth is not spinning or not spinning in relation to the sun so that eventually the water and all atmosphere will bulge towards the sun and stay that way, but instead is always trying to fall to the sun pulling on it so that pull would equally try to accelerate the other half of the time except the tilt of the axis causes a pull to the south and pull to the north creating a wave like activity so you have a constant wave generator... Oh and let&#39;s not forget the influence of the Moon in all this... so next experiment is to see what the results are as the moon and the sun align and oppose. Appose causes high tides because water is a liquid but when they align it causes riptides because huge amounts of gravity is exerted on only one side of the earth at one time so everything is rushing to get there, but again cannot ever catch up. <br>WoW how amazing perfect clockwork there is to cause all the effect to create this incredible paradise... What if we already are here but the evil has told a lie and made &quot;Heaven&quot; a place to get to, so that the effect is that we are not there....Here...  I say we are already here, we just need to manifest a better one for ourselves and others by command (ask and believe) not order but command with full authority, just as we have over our creations but have lost our knowledge for prosperity by believing the lie of lacking. Abundance is Abundant! and all created and given to us... the most amazing gift ever... thank you Creator!!!! <br>  So in closing .. thank you all for participating and sharing without getting nasty... well most of you.. it is wonderful to hear others thoughts  on various phenomena.. such as ourselves. Seriously have you ever conceived of the most contradictory creature? We are inherently social creatures and yet those who have the least amount of social interaction exhibit the most rejectionable attitude and antisocial behavior. Scientists claim is to discover what already is in the endeavor to explain it better and yet once they think they have figured it out nothing else will do. Religionists who believe in &quot;God Almighty&quot; belittle &quot;God&quot; into a box of their making and say God can not use &quot;evolution&quot; in creating and maintaining the universe for us and at the same time will want to stone you if you believe &quot;God&quot; grants you miracles on a daily bases...and scientists who admit that miracles do exist refuse to put it into their calculations... flat earther&#39;s continue to ass-ert the earth is flat when they have no real evidence of it ignore the most obvious evidence that it is not and the anti flat earther&#39;s refuse to believe there is or has been a giant conspiracy.... etc etc..<br>  Wow talk about diversity.. that is one thing we can all agree on..

I&#39;m not a big fan of scishow and Hank, but the coriolis effect and the toilets&#39; flush doesn&#39;t have that much relation. It&#39;s true that coriolis effect does affect the water bodies when it comes to hurricanes or cyclones, or a big stable perfect cylinder-shaped tube. However, in normal toilets that the average human being use isn&#39;t so large and &quot;flat&quot; and stable. Coriolis effect is so small. The earth rotates per day, but the water that swirl in the normal toilets spin much, much faster than that. The Coriolis force does impact the direction of the flow of water, but only minutely. Only if the water is so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may indeed determine the direction of the vortex, like in this video. However, this is not the myth tells. The common myth insists that the water flow from a flushing toilet swirl depending on the very hemisphere we&#39;re at.

I&#39;ve been a hair stylist for 30years in the northern hemisphere. Now on to the good stuff. Hair rarely grows straight out of the body, in other words not at 90\u00b0 from the skin. It grows out on slight various angles. When many hairs grow in the same angle in an area they are referred to as a growth pattern. Some growth patterns have names such as a &quot;cow-lick&quot; or &quot;whirl&quot;... Men have a much higher occurrence of whirls. Generally they are located in the center top portion of the head referred to as the crown. Whirls are also usually found on the pectoral muscles of a mans chest.

As you are a physicist (I am just a hobbyist), I wish that you had a link to a website with the mathematical calculations to support your demonstrated effect.  I did some calculations using my location in Los Angeles, CA USA.  Assuming a six-foot diameter pool, I calculate the differential speed between the edge of the pool and a drain located in the center of the pool to be 2.234 x 10-3 mm/sec, or approx. 8 mm/hour.  Therefore, a molecule of water at the edge of the pool would &quot;miss&quot; the drain by 8 mm if the outflow through the drain was slow enough for the molecule to require one hour to make it through the drain.  My calculations do not take into account the viscosity of the water, which I believe would act as a counter-force to the Coriolis Effect and therefore reduce the amount of distance that the molecule missed the drain.  Additionally, I believe that this distance would be further reduced my calculations do not take into account the vector resulting from the Coriolis Effect and the momentum of the water molecule as it moves toward the drain, which would further reduce the distance that the molecule of water moving from the edge to the center would &quot;miss&quot; the drain.  Any mathematical feedback would be greatly appreciated.  As a side note, I assume that if the pool straddled the equator so the drain was exactly on the equator, the water on both sides of the pool, furthest from the equator would move clockwise and counter-clockwise to the line of the equator, where the forces would be cancelled, and then move along the equator to the drain.", "comment_date": "2017-03-20T18:20:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lol", "comment_text": "I find it really hard to belive that the earth&#39;s rotation could have such a big effect on such a tiny pool.
