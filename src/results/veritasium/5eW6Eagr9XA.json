IS TO GROW YOUR OWN , make your own. fix it yourself. FORGE THE HARTHSTONE AND SOLDER JOINTS and weld frames and build that small peace of heaven with gods gift to man or woman. COMPETENCE? no....ABILIFIDELLITY and going for  A HIKE AFTER YOUR GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT. HOMES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING PEOPLE EVER HAD. WE DONT NEED TO BUILD MORE&gt; WE NEED TO PROVIDE A WAY FOR EVERYONE TO COME HOME AND THOSE PEOPLE I MET who are LIVING in A state of constant FEAR OR WORRY. ARE NOT THE PROBLEM AS MUCH as A symptom of our inability to see what each of our missiion here is CLEARLY. I DO NOT ENDORSE ADS FOR ANY ONE THING&gt; I PROMOTE THE SUM OF EVERYONE TO BE. A PART OF THE WHOLE LOVE THAT LIFE is made possible because of. AND NOONE LOVES THE SAME&gt; but we got to start loving each other no matter what at a bare minimum. AND ITS NOT WAGE SLAVERY, IF you figure it out like  i saw so many do....I WANT TO TO LIVE IN A YELLOW HOUSE BOAT. and I wouldnt trust it would float. i move my home and it goes with me where i go .

BUT THE SCIENTISTS TOLD US ABOUT ALL OF THIS LONG AGO&gt; AS EARLY AS THE SEVENTIES WE HAD GREEN PEACE&gt; AND LARGE BOATS HUNTED THOSE WHO HUNTED WHALES FOR A LIVING&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION...PETROLEUM....THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL THO. SO WHILE WE DISAGREE ON HOW. WE ALL KNOW WHY...WE ARE JUST CONSUMERS and WE NEED TO MAKE MONEY...THATS THE LEVEL MOST PEOPLE ARE LIVING AT TODAY BRO. SO whats is real to them is that they need to feel good about going to work and seeing themselves as important and a real expert on any one thing at all. is good enough. for most men. SO WE WANT TO SUPPORT GOOD FATHERS WHO MARRY WOMAN AND THEN WE HAVE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE WHOLESOME AND FOSTER FARMS MORE THAN CREATE ARROWHEADS AND PRAISE GUN OWNERSHIP. WHY? BECAUSE WHAT MAKES PEOPLE HAPPY MORE THAN ANYTHING IS FEELING AND KNOWING THAT THEIR LOVE AND STUGGLES IN LIFE MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE WHOLE AND ITS NOT PERFECT AT ALL&gt;so NO MATTER WHAT SCIENCE SAYS and yes STEM IS AN ACROnym for science technology engineering and math.....HOWEVER DO WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD NEWER AND BETTER THINGS ALL THE TIME? NO WE NEED TO FIND WAYS OF KEEPING AND MAINTAINING PEOPLES ABILITY TO BE GOOD STEWARDS TO THE LAND IN WHICH THEY ARE LIVING. SO....the best way to do that is to educate people to understand the problem. AND THE PROBLEM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IS HUMANITY, and its WILLFULLNESS TO THINK IT KNOWS WHAT ITS DOING.   EVER CREATE A LIFE? HOW? NO IDEA DO YOU. BUT TOGETHER YOU AND YOUR WIFE SOMEHOW MADE IT HAPPEN DIDNT YOU?&gt;  I DONT KNOW FOR CERTAIN BUT I AM MAKING A  PROBABLE GUESS&gt;  and i think you talked about your son before. NOT SURE...anyways I LIKE YOU ALOT AND HAVE WATCHED YOUR SHOW FOR A LONG TIME&gt; BUT THE ONLY WAY WE GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE...is not by thinking so much about the problems we have today. which were and will always be multifaceted and more complex than necessary but by finding simple soltuions to them and we are doing that all the time. THE WORLD DOESNT NEED ANOTHER PET ROCK NOR DOES IT NEED MORE ALTERNATIVE FUELS&gt; what people and young men and those who are poor need. ARE STABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TO REST AND CREATE ..WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE ARTISTS NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. MORE WRITERs. MORE MUSCIANS more street magicians. MORE HUMOR&gt; more  understading of each other. and those that our truly humble do not live alone in single family residences and every room is furnsihed with expennsice gifts and the best of everything. THE SOLUTION IS NOT IN WHO MAKES THE BEST OF ANY ONE THING&gt; ITS GETTING EVERYONE ON BOARD WITH AN IDEA THAT IS ONCE AGAIN CHANGING THE WORLD AS IT DID many MILLENNIA AGO. IF NOT LOVE then what is the alternative....rain dances? gene therapies or engineering prenatal babies to create actual supermen. WE HAVE BEEN DOMESTICATING LIVESTOCK AS WELL AS HUMANITY FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS&gt; or actually more like 25k years. BUT HOW do DINOSAURS live to be 65 million years olD? and the druids did all that work because they were superstitious? why was it called the JAMES WEBB and did we really gain for humanity more than HUBBLE THE TELESCOPEbecause  HUBBLE THE MAN was my heroe. and i drove up to where his telescope was in the loft above the city how diffferrent that time was 130 years ago or so....or was it 90...either way. WHAT I AM SAYING IS YES THE UNIVERSE IS AMAZING. but thips place this life. all of it we have been given and we know water is the primary solution that allows it to be. SO THEN FRIEND WHAT ARE WE OTHER THAN. WATER THAT  when properly mixed with salts and a variety of aminos somehow got a twist in it and that twist copies half of itself and usingthe same kind of powerhouse in plants to produce energy to clone its self in a way that is complementary to the host of all the cells. and when that happens what is happening is some how some way life is giving a middle finger to the third law or perhaps alll the laws of the thermodynamics. IF WE DO NOT CONTINUE LIFE AS WE THINK WE KNOW WHATS GOOD&gt; ITS LIFE THAT IS GOOD&gt; WE SHOULD AIM FOR HARMONY and only then will we rest assured on the ephemeral shores of tranquility.  DOINATE YOUR BRAIN TO HUMANITY......please go downtown and help feed the homeless. and do it more than this ...you have made alot of people get interested in learning and science. BUT YOU ARE NOT GOD ANY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IS&gt; AND YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED&gt; god gave you a gift. TO BE GIVING....SO DO IT! HONOR IS MADE BY BEING A LIGHT AND PLUNGING YOURSELF INTO THE DARKEST of places. I DID. and I helped GOD save the world. YOU CAN TOO...I BELIEVE YOU DO.....but less science brother for making. and more for fixing the problems its found a way to make a mess of em...DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IM SAYING TO YOU  SON?", "comment_date": "2022-09-15T03:10:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HeartSings SacredSongsUntold", "comment_text": "i eat chessmen. cause im a cookie momster! no seriously its a disease. and im just trying to avoid big surgery to my briam.

So the &quot;truth&quot; in my view is that stock pickers can achieve a very small positive additional return, but the fees they charge to fund investors are for some reason outsized so the investor ends up doing worse than investing in a passive fund.

He thinks a lack of experience is the issue. The issue is the dominant political ideological framework by which people understand the world is incredibly simple, filled with lies, misinformation and originates from a political basis rather than a factual one. This dominant ideology infects every aspect of life, because it informs anything to do with politics and economics. This is why they&#39;re consistently wrong, because the beliefs they hold are the ones convenient for the powerful in society, rather than beliefs stemming  from true scientific investigation of the world and how it operates.

You accept lower returns in the good times and a lower overall long term return in exchange for smaller losses in the bad times. This is useful if, for example, you&#39;re retiring. You might not live to see the returns on a long term investment, and you need at least some of the funds in the short term so heavy short-term losses aren&#39;t acceptable. So you put your money into a hedge fund to protect it against inflation while also keeping short-term losses to a minimum.<br>From this point of view, the basket of hedge funds seems to me to be doing pretty well.

Nothing human is ever random, because random itself is the result of intentionality at some point, with some purpose.

I liked the video.<br>While I understand the point you are making in this video I would like to point out some stuff that bothers me a little.<br>First, the definition of being expert at something has to be defined precisely beforehand. In this video it seems like you defined an expert as someone that can predict outcomes more accurately than the average given that the problem is in their field. Which is OK for the sake of the video but still disregards the added value pure knowledge and sorted information can have on their own.<br>Second, when comparing a tennis player ball control and a prediction of future events is unfair. What could be comparable is a tennis player predicting the outcome of a match beforehand VS predicting how a student is going to be doing. To me, the most important thing you mentioned is the quantity of variables involved. I think what makes an expert has more to do with the number of variables one can deal with while staying accurate and less about the accuracy of predictions with too many variables. The success rate a pro tennis player has when predicting the outcome of a match after looking only at the shoes the players are wearing and the kind of rackets they have has nothing to do with his expertise in the field. It would not surprise me if, given a problem with a set number of variables, all experts had similar results regardless of the field.<br>So what I want to say is that while I think I get what you&#39;re saying, the way it is presented make it seem that in some areas there can be no expert and thus invalidating any expert input in high variable contexts. While true to some extent the way of phrasing it can be harmful today. In a world where climate change and health hazards exists, should we dismiss climatologists and health specialists when they are working in high variable environments? These people cannot predict accurately the future but does that make their input worthless? Are they not to be called experts because of that? As unpredictable the future is, an epidemiologist telling to wear a mask (low variables) should be listened to even if when predicting the state of an outbreak her/his opinion should be considered in a more critical manner.<br><br>English is not my first language I hope that was understandable enough though :)<br><br>Have a nice day!", "comment_date": "2022-08-19T06:47:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AD Drums", "comment_text": "Way to disincentivize everyone \ud83e\udd23 \ud83c\udfc6", "comment_date": "2022-08-19T06:37:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "harbor melody", "comment_text": "Investing in crypto currency is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority.

I&#39;ve seen chessmasters being for example able to play through a long series of move in their heads to determine whether that is the correct move. So long and complicated that not only would most people be unable to get the ideas for those moves, but they are simply unable to generate the pictures of these positions in their head. Another example is chessmasters being able to play multiple opponents blindfolded at the same time. I would not even be able to remember my own pieces postion on a a single board after just a couple of move. No normal human can play 10 people, without seeing the boards and win, no way. Those skills may not be related to IQ, but they are certainly something more then recognizing patterns or chess positions.<br>You can&#39;t just remember the positions all throughout the games, you have to rigorously check most relevant moves as small details in the position which has not occured before may make the whole difference. Not only that but you have to understand the position, not just remeber what happened in previous game, since each position holds an almost endless number of variations.<br><br>No matter how many games I played, how strong my memory was i would still not be nearly as quick witted, stragetic and least of all as good at visualizing the board as a chess master. Despite having played many chess games,  when playing through more that 5 moves ahead in my mind I will easily get lost unless it is forced moves and will easily miss important detaiils, not because of my lack of understanding but simply because i cannot make the mental picture and check the position carefully.", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T23:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Project NEMESI5", "comment_text": "1.

What I notice is that these people fairly easy learn how to avoid bugs and write code that executes, but are terrible at preventing structural issues (e.g. does this software scale easily or how easy is it to add new functionality in the future). The timely feedback issue seems crititcal here. When trying to write code that executes, the feedback is almost immediate: The software returns an error on running or it doesn&#39;t. The structural problems however aren&#39;t evaluated by any immediate system or even at all (especially for people who&#39;s main area of expertise is actually not software).", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T16:01:58Z", "likes_count": 341}, {"comment_by": "Forrest L", "comment_text": "i wish the board game Go would get more attention in western circles. it&#39;s always Chess...", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T15:35:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chaedu", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA&amp;t=4m22s\">4:22</a> great insight", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T14:41:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oktoberfest", "comment_text": "Did the thumbnail just changed?", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T14:37:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alve Svar\u00e9n", "comment_text": "As a software developer, I really feel that I get better at solving problems using my intuition, and all the 4 concepts you listed in this video matches my experience perfectly.<br><br>Great video!", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T14:36:48Z", "likes_count": 107}, {"comment_by": "Reginald Freeman", "comment_text": "An &#39;ex&#39; is a &#39;has-been&#39; and a (s)purt is a drip under pressure ...", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T14:36:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chaedu", "comment_text": "This is what I needed today as a content thank you Veritasium", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T14:36:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ss Transland", "comment_text": "thousands of physics problems are hard bro, what if every other problem is 10 times tougher in terms of cognitive weight and variables and mixing and fusing them in abstract scenarios?", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T14:35:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ss Transland", "comment_text": "&quot;chess masters as a group are not exceptional at these measures &quot; is a false statement", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T14:30:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_ tissael _", "comment_text": "The best video so far!

Long version short: there are 4 different components to how to learn. There is competence level (incompetent or competent) and conscious level (conscious or unconscious). As you started learning a new skill, you were considered unconscious incompetent - you didn&#39;t know what you needed to know &amp; were unaware of that combined with being largely incompetent at it. As you got better, you moved up to conscious incompetent (where you now understand that you didn&#39;t know what to do and you were still incompetent at doing it). Then you could move up another level to concious competent (at this point, you&#39;re good at something BUT you have to still focus hard to do the task) and then finally, the ultimate level is unconscious competent (which is where you are so good AND practiced at the task you don&#39;t need to think and devote all your brain power to do it AND you&#39;re also competent at it).

Stock prices only move due to trading activity (goes up due to buying, goes down due to selling) so its the actions of active traders that ultimately creates the market average.

Repeated Attempts with feedback:<br>This represents the data you&#39;ve got and its labels, or alternatively actual attempts and rewards in the case of reinforcement learning. Examples are AI &quot;attempting&quot; to classify images of dogs/cats and being told it&#39;s right or wrong. For RL it could be a chess playing AI playing a match and receiving feedback in the form of winning or losing.<br><br>2. Valid Environment:<br>Like illustrated for humans in the video, if the environment is random, AI won&#39;t end up learning anything. However in the button example, unlike the human, and much like the rat, the AI should converge to only choosing the green button. If the input to the AI is the same for each attempt this convergence should happen pretty much immediately. If the input is completely random the AI will still attempt to find patterns like the human, but I believe it should still converge to only the choice with the highest probability.<br><br>3. Timely Feedback:<br>This one isn&#39;t super relevant to supervised learning since it&#39;s assumed the data is provided with labels, no matter how timely those labels/feedback were given in the data gathering stage. For example, if you&#39;re using AI to predict grades of students based on their past grades, you won&#39;t wait for current students to get their grades; you&#39;d simply train on past data that already includes the feedback (which I guess is also possible for humans actually). <br>Timely feedback is more relevant to reinforcement learning. That&#39;s why RL training is often done in simulations instead of the real world: to speed up feedback (and also to limit actual real world damage in some cases, like in robotics or self-driving). An example of this sped up feedback is the famous AlphaStar playing a custom version of the StarCraft game, where instead of waiting for the standard game in real time, it was able to play something crazy like 400 years overnight.<br>However, this is actually just learning faster. The AI would learn just as well if it didn&#39;t have timely feedback, just slower. For humans I guess the problem is that we might forget our thought process and decision by the time the feedback arrives, because our minds are occupied with other things and not focused on a single goal.<br><br>4. Deliberate Practice / Don&#39;t get too comfortable:<br>Indeed if AI comes across certain rare examples, and then keeps training afterwards without seeing similar examples again, it can end up &quot;forgetting&quot;. This happens because the model is continuously optimized for the most recent batch of examples (in mini-batch gradient decent at least), which means at every nudge of its parameters it does not care at all about previous batches. The reason this works is because the batches have patterns in common, and therefore the model will learn these common patterns, and gradually forget anything that doesn&#39;t line up with these patterns. This is a feature, not a bug; if it learned everything, instead of just the patterns, that&#39;s simply memorization, which doesn&#39;t generalize to new examples not included in the data.<br><br><br>Basically, going by this video, if a human can be an expert at something, AI can do it better (if the data is there) \ud83d\ude0c", "comment_date": "2022-08-11T09:33:03Z", "likes_count": 199}, {"comment_by": "naniro1616", "comment_text": "Radiologist here, along with the medical expertise you have the limits of the method.

Epstein cites kahleman a lot in &#39;Range&#39;, and most of those examples are re-presented in this video.<br><br>I dunno. Sort of feel like these sources needed to be acknowledged in the videos. Like stating they were based on them. Or go read them, or something. Sure kahleman is cited once here, but I kept getting the feeling that the channel was passing off the neat packaging of these ideas as its own, rather than based on two incredible books.<br><br>Could be a bizarre coincidence, of course, X 2.

One can of course do slightly better if you wait for longer runs before you start the guessing red, and in that way &#39;improve&#39; your success.

For economic reasons, most glass blowers will develop a product (dont tell them that, thell sware that the 1000th pipe thats exactly the same as the 999 previous pipes is art) and when that happens, the ability to control glass of those artists plateau. However, they usually dont plateau in their career. Because they make the same thing thousands of times with little to no variation they can spend time developing their business and the value of their name. So they may not be an expert glass blower in the sense of their creativity and ability to control glass but an expert glass blower in the sense of capitalism and economic prosperity. I found this video really interesting because ive realized all of these points independently form multiple disciplines where i have a goal of skill development (skiing, mtn biking, glass blowing, cooking, gardening and video games). Skiing especially, i learned skills and drills that ingrained different sets of feelings and movements that are executed as a single act while in a situation that isnt training.

It seems entirely reasonable to say that we &quot;shouldn&#39;t trust experts&quot; in fields where there isn&#39;t 1. repeated attempts with feedback, 2. environment validity, and 3. timely feedback (the 4th point is seemingly obviously true), but this line of reasoning seems to have large gaps in normal considerations of &quot;mastery&quot; or &quot;expertise&quot; and how one would get to such a level. For example, a master composer, who might reasonably be considered a master because their novel compositions deeply reached millions, would not particularly learn to compose by writing 1000 pieces while receiving timely and valid feedback on each one (music doesn&#39;t particularly have &quot;valid feedback&quot; anyways). Nonetheless, said master composer could absolutely learn from other methods, like listening to lots of music while trying to hear different music patterns, or experimenting on their own with only &quot;self-feedback&quot;, or attempting to &quot;understand&quot; other peoples music, or learning to &quot;find their own niche&quot;, etc. (all of which lack the first 3 criteria where the video seem to strongly suggests that even missing just 1 immediately invalidates the practice).<br><br>This kind of &quot;reductionist&quot; viewpoint (of seeing humans as basically just &quot;machine learning models&quot; that need lots of data and feedback in a valid environment) may be true to some extent, but is clearly not the end-all-be-all of expertise or mastery, which for the most part is more of an open question in cognitive and computational learning research.

I have to take exception to a conclusion you drew about radiologists and mammography. The overall miss rate for breast cancer on screening mammography (pts without palpable lumps, etc.), is actually about 1 in 8, 12.5%. Not the 30 % implied. There was a study years ago which may have misled your reasearch. That study found that 70 odd percent of breast cancers could be identified on prior imaging, but that does not mean that the all findings necessarily represented cancer at the time of prior imaging. As an aside for those who may wonder why - If all potential findings on every mammogram were worked up with additional views the overall radiation exposure in the patient population would become unreasonable and the cost would be prohibitive.<br>The suggestion that the high miss rate (obviously, even 12.5 %, is far from ideal) is due to lack of feedback is interesting. Radiologists do get feedback on their performance both in terms of overall stats like cancer detection rate and, to an imperfect extent on individual cases. I think it is that feedback, combined with continuing ed that allows more experienced radiologists to read with greater confidence and usually fewer additional view mammograms than more recently trained docs. In my experience the less experienced docs request more additional views but their cancer detection rate seems quite comparable to experienced docs.", "comment_date": "2022-08-08T22:12:08Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "BaldingEagle51", "comment_text": "According to your definition, yes.

If you can&#39;t beat the S&amp;P, you aren&#39;t paying attention to who and what is driving the S&amp;P to perform these days. Big hint, it is NOT the other 490 companies. The best competitors, in the industries growing the most, who manage their operations well are the biggest wave makers in the ocean that is filling. And simple math on stocks tells you with an 87% certainty, when to buy and sell, so you know when a stock is overbought, oversold, or is in a long term down trend. You can ride every wave, and avoid nearly every low, with virtually certainty, leverage your gains, 150% per year is EASY... once you KNOW: stock brokers will NEVER tell you the truth where they invest THEIR money, and the simple math is right in front of you; in fact, already calculated for you. <br><br>AI algorithms can&#39;t pick better than me, because they only know what they are told. They don&#39;t know why. They see a stock go down? They see a buying opportunity because they are told to. When certain metrics are met, sell, even if it is a good company. 90% of stock trades are handled this way now. So only the top 5 to 10 companies get rewarded, and seldom punished. They ASSUME that the winners will KEEP winning, which becomes a self fulfilling prophesy, but they can&#39;t see who will win based on FUNDAMENTALS. Which is based on simple but interpretive math, based on competition. <br><br>No one cares if you are the strongest competitor at dressage, a daft competition for silly rich people who want to judge horses &quot;dance&quot;. It&#39;s not important. Too small a pool, no matter how rich the spectators. EVERYONE cares when you are the strongest competitor at soccer because it is the world&#39;s richest sport. Pick the biggest ocean, the best competitor, ride their waves. Double your gains every year (good competitors do), use leverage to double those gains. If you are as good as you think, you will amplify your gains. If not, you&#39;re not as good as you think. PRODUCE, or die. <br><br>My hedge clients got the first 35% of their return, commission free, because I can&#39;t legally &quot;guarantee&quot; a return. After that, we are equal partners. My money goes where yours does, and we split it 50/50 after that. 70% return nets me half of 35 or 17.5%, they keep the other 52.5%. But, for those gains, I DESERVE a huge commission because you could NOT do that on your own (and I won&#39;t work for free by &quot;only&quot; doubling your money every 2 years). At 120%, my cut is 42.5% of the gains (120-35=85 /2= 42.5). I don&#39;t get paid to lose. I only take my commission when you cash out, not before: we are in this together. I only get paid if you make out like a bandit, doubling your money every year (rule of 72). PRODUCE (returns), or die. Cut your losses. I already minted the 500 millionaires I set out to do, in only 4 years; and then I cut them loose. I got them the number for retirement we agreed to at the beginning: time to &quot;retire&quot;. Retire, does NOT mean you stop working. It means from now on, you don&#39;t have to do ANYTHING if you don&#39;t want to, including work. You are free. Don&#39;t mess up your freedom. <br><br>Some were greedy, and still wanted me to make them more money for them, some even tried to blackmail me to do so. Don&#39;t message me, I&#39;m not EVER taking any more clients after how I was treated by greedy scum. Retired at age 30 because you need to recognize when you&#39;ve won at the casino, walk away while you still can; it&#39;s later than you think. Just saying: it&#39;s so easy, this millennial can do it. From homeless after college, to retired .01% in 7 years. My degree was not in finance because: it&#39;s not hard. <br><br>Either you work for others, or they work for you. One is a slave, the other a master. Only ownership can make you rich, which is why most people never do. They don&#39;t own their life, their job, or their assets. Most people don&#39;t even know what an asset is. Some don&#39;t know how to afford more than one house, but EVERYONE can own stock. It&#39;s cheap and easy. Not everyone can be the boss, but everyone is a master of their own fate. Number one profession for millionaires? Not doctor, not lawyer: JANITOR. Why, tells you everything you need to know. If they are any good they start their own business, if they are any good at that, they hire others to WORK FOR THEM, don&#39;t try to act rich because... janitor, and they invest in their money machine: their business, themselves. All the keys you need to succeed. Doctors and lawyer feel the need to &quot;act rich&quot;, and don&#39;t invest in themselves because: they already &quot;made it&quot;!<br><br>Make your money work for you, make your house work for you, make your kids work for you, make your car work for you. Or... YOU can keep working, for money, rather than it working for you. Be a slave or a master. You can (in 50 years) get rich by working for others, but never wealthy: generational wealth, that your kids can tap into. You have to enslave some one or some thing (or both) to get wealthy. Your choice. Liabilities, or assets? Debt, or cash. You can only go one way or the other, not both. And you are either heading towards being promoted, or you are headed towards being fired. Breaking up, or getting married. Which are you? You already know which.

Showing me where I need to focus my attention. When I have the time to spare. The trick to that is you have to find a rhythm. You have to be in sync with the information coming in. There are patterns to it. You will learn the patterns and you will be be mentally preparing yourself for the bombardment of intimidating information coming in.

And so we can say that the past event before earth creation has ended and non retrievable ( i guess).<br>- Looking at the sky from the perspective view of a viewer located on earth in the present time, will make him see any object at that time when the event happened taking in consideration the distance that light has to travel, for example: event1 happened at t1 in d1 located 1 year from earth, so viewer on earth can see this event at t1+1year.<br>Considering the above, if i am thinking logically, there is no way to see the event that happened before the creation of the earth, because those events lead to earth to exist.<br>But scientist says that they can see the beginning of the universe by looking deep into space. How is that possible?  The only way i can think of, to look at events that lead to earth to exist is that there must be something faster than light ( maybe the progression of the creation of the universe), that made earth exist and so the light from the beginning of the universe can arrive to the viewer on the earth later on to be able to see it.<br>I hope to get a scientific explanation on how this is possible.

If you rate the expertise of driving as the ability to get from A to B without crashing (which for most of us is the entire point) then extra experience absolutely does improve your expertise. The data on accident claims, especially those involving injury, is extremely clear. A driver aged around 20 is about 3 times more likely to be involved in an accident than someone aged around 50, which is typically the point of peak performance. This in part is due to older people being more careful, but not entirely - we see the same effect based on driving experience as well.

They pass predictions through the filter of their highly emotive politics which impedes their ability to analyze objectively. They want the opposing political force to be the villain in their predictive models and their own politics to be the hero in the narrative. Most fail to appreciate that nature does not line up perfectly to their simplistic political models. <br><br>Consider the case of climate change, Rightwing pundits tend to  produce predictive models that either claim it doesn&#39;t exist, isn&#39;t  a big problem if it does exist, or if a big problem claim government intervention still isn&#39;t the way to solve the issue. On the other hand, leftwing pundits produce economic/regulatory models that claim varying degrees of government intervention is necessary. Both these views are based on assumptions on how the combination of pollution, atmospheric physics, industrial innovation and large number of other scientific and technology factors play out. Not only is neither of these two political factions typically academically equipped to provide a scientific opinion on the issue but even among scientific experts no single person is. The issue is too complex for a single mind to predict with certain outcome. What we are really doing is  risk management based on current available evidence that is subject to change.<br><br>Perhaps tomorrow some genius in private industry invents a scalable and profitable way to carbon capture by turning it into fuel for ICE engines. That would mean government intervention wasn&#39;t necessarily so the rightwing model was right. On the other hand, perhaps the IPCC panel had far too moderate predictions due to pressure from rightwing polemists. Say temperatures rise by an average of 10C in the next century instead. Not only would government intervention be necessary but a significant chunk of the planet would become uninhabitable.", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T17:21:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zach Olivare", "comment_text": "The bit here about chess piece memorization (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA&amp;t=1m45s\">1:45</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA&amp;t=3m35s\">3:35</a>) here is nearly word for word recited from \u201cThe Power of Habit\u201d by Duhigg without a direct citation.", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T17:21:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sabed Hussain", "comment_text": "This video is a visual summary of the book Peak by Anders Ericsson and Rober Pool...Please give credit where its due", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T17:15:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Kirk-Coughlan", "comment_text": "He said aparthied \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, it\u2019s pronounced apart(emphasis on the r and t)hayt", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T17:10:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary T", "comment_text": "This video reminded me of the book Atomic Habits \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T17:09:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Douglas", "comment_text": "Why when you read &#39;experts&#39; say, in a news article, realize its mostly like BS with an agenda.", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T17:03:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Crondis", "comment_text": "I feel like there is another thing missing: desire/passion. Who is an expert in physics or chess or gymnastics and straight up doesnt like it or didnt like it at some point?

And I found that the general desires of some directly conflict with becoming an expert in anything: <br>Some people want randomness, spontaneity, unpredictability, a lack of repetition. I personally get bored with repetition. I think some people&#39;s passions won&#39;t allow for some of these to happen:<br>Desire for comfort, Diversity (non-repetitive), Softness (not critical, not having much feedback so as not to be too wrong, rigid, stiff, competitive), Chance/Randomness (like the casino or stocks, the random can be exciting and fun, a non-valid environment can be desirable for enjoyment). <br>I am not an expert in anything, because I desire comfort, I hate repetition, and I don&#39;t really trust certain areas of feedback in the few things I do like. I am a meditator, but I don&#39;t trust someone to analyze my meditation and give me feedback. Additionally, if I do a work of art that I love, I don&#39;t really care if an &quot;expert&quot; approves of it. The things I like usually have feedback that I give myself, and is not external. But then I don&#39;t necessarily make things or do things that impress others. <br><br>Just what I thought in response to this.

For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

You seem to look at stocks like paper bouncing around, actually your not right if the stock went your way or not. As Buffet would have said, you get real feedback on your investment by looking at what the business itself produced. Looking at stock performances to decide if you were right or wrong is different from checking the quarterly earnings report to confirm if you were right or wrong. If you look at financials and try to make estimations you can get feedback quarterly! This is exactly why we can argue Buffett is an expert to a degree.<br>My second comment is, the purpose of a Hedge Fund is not to outperform the market but provide risk-adjusted returns. So you can not say the large capital in active management should rather be in passive management. Your solely looking at the last 10 years or of data when markets set new highs.

The Newspaper heard of an old printing press tech ( Non Degree Engineer) who had 30 plus years of experience working on printing press&#39;s. Fianaly the Newspaper called the old printing press tech.

The old printing press tech billed the Newspaper $15,000 for his time and expense. The old printing press tech spent a total of 25 minutes to fix the problem. The managers at the Newspaper were very upset with the charges to fix the printing press. When the managers confronted the old printing press tech about the bill, they were mad about paying $15,000 for less than  half an hours work! They asked the old printing press tech how could he charge them $15,000 for half an hours work! The old printing press tech responded with &quot; It was 10 minutes to find the problem, 15 minutes to fix the problem and  32 years of experience to learn where to look for the problem!

Namely, has the west aided and abetted China\u2019s organ harvesting industry?\u201d explained the article, \u201cOr, in more human terms, if Yang had stuck around in Beijing to have her living heart cut out, might that surgeon have received relevant training from a British university, or even the NHS (National Health Service)?\u201d\r<br>\r<br>A Supply Chain\r<br>One known fact is that that global demand for organs vastly outstrips legitimate supply. Professor Martin Elliott from London\u2019s Great Ormond Street Hospital said organs are often desperately sought. This led to an organ tourism market worth about $1.7 billion a year. A Japanese woman even paid $5 million for a liver, the article stated. \r<br>\r<br>These transplant \u201cagents\u201d are available in many countries and health insurance companies in Israel even used to offer help to clients finding such agents in China. Although such incentives are understandable, \u201cwhat is less clear to the casual observer is how in a couple of short decades China managed to become the organ transplant centre of the world.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Wayne Jordash QC, founder of Global Rights Compliance, tried to find the answer. \u201cAt the beginning of the 2000s the PRC leapt from a follower to a leader of transplantation technology,\u201d he said. \u201cTransplant tourists and Chinese citizens were reported to have access to a matched organ within weeks or months, in comparison to other countries where patients could be on a transplant waiting list for years despite well-established donation systems.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>The next question is the source of the ample supply of these organs. The Chinese authorities said in 2009 that two-thirds of organs used for transplantations were taken from death row prisoners. \u201cBut that simply didn\u2019t stack up. From 2000, the number of executions following a death penalty sentence declined, while the transplantation system grew exponentially,\u201d explained the article. \r<br>\r<br>That is why people turned to Falun Gong, a meditation system harshly suppressed by Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \u201cMass arrests followed. Since then the number of Falun Gong practitioners who have fallen victim to forced organ harvesting are, conservatively, estimated to amount to hundreds of thousands,\u201d wrote the article, \u201cAccording to Sir Geoffrey Nice\u2019s China Tribunal, 60,000 to 100,000 transplantations took place annually between 2000 and 2014, with Falun Gong practitioners serving as the principal source.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Several years after forced organ harvesting was exposed, China said in 2010 that organ procurement from executed prisoners would end in 2015 and be replaced with voluntary donation. \u201cBut experts don\u2019t believe that for a minute. They point out that the number of organs used in China for transplantations greatly outstrips the number that could ever be garnered from voluntary donation,\u201d wrote the article.", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T02:38:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yootooberkev15", "comment_text": "Is this a reupload?

Over long term the market may return more but the historic volatility and implied volatility are higher and risks higher losses. A hedge fund has much lower historic and implied volatility in it&#39;s returns so the highs and lows are evened out. It is really just a way for rich investors to secure their money in volatile market conditions. If they were worried about making more money then they would bite the risk and put all of their money in an index.

It took me several hours of learning many scripts, listening to many youtube videos (beyond 10.000h probably) and attending the lectures. <br>At one point i even stoped walking to the lecture due the repetition itself.<br>But that would only proof you, that i am solely an idiot. <br><br>But let me give you a different perspective.<br>Learning is achieved, when the student asks himself the question and answers his own question thanks to the given materials.<br>Learning is more or less a thought process, that is translated in language. We think. We feel. We dream in a language. By having these thoughts, traumas or habits in our self, we can all express ourselves, where we like to address the own field.<br><br>I have played for more then 20 years chess (started in my childhood), i have failed High School one year and repeated that year for my A-levels to score better.<br>During that time i experienced a phenomen that is unknown to many.<br>One is, that i could see with my logical reasoning the subject again, instead being overly taught by the teacher. Second is that it is way easier to express yourself and get the given dynamical social feedback. <br>I was referred as &quot;Smart&quot; meanwhile i was just a spoiled brat, that liked chess, played many hours of computer games or watched Animes.<br>My mother and father sended me during the kindergarten to a chess club and as well my mother asked me &quot;1+1&quot; with fast iterative question. <br>Both of my parents had no education and were immigrants in germany.<br><br>I could help during that repetition dozen of students, expressed them also my feelings (from Animes or from my personal trauma) and scored better. But when the next year of A-Level came, i had to study, like any student as well and my scores droped. People would normally say laziness. That is natural. But no one regards the countless nights, when you speak with your parents in the same language about &quot;advanced&quot; topics. My father died early and was abusive. <br>My mother couldn&#39;t speak german and worked outside.<br>She filled once in the week the fridge with foods, while my sister and i lived lessifar. <br>The same experience occured to me later after my failed study, when i changed the specialization. So i had to take mostly all of the subject in different regards.<br>During college i learned many things and i participated in a NGO for many students abroad. (Erasmus)<br>I organized events and led the association. I even learned more about myself during that whole time. Meanwhile my grades weren&#39;t the best and i choose the another specialization in electric engineering. Previous Engineering was in some way interesting and stiff. Now it is as usual with the new contents and reasoning interesting..<br>I started to tinker for myself. Took a part time job. Financed my whole makerspaces. <br>Randomly i met a kid in the university.

His premise was that the age cutoff (i&#39;ll be &quot;remembering from memory&quot; here, so the dates/leagues etc used for illustration purposes only!) throughout a player&#39;s youth was September 30th and therefore any kid born shortly after that would be older (hence bigger,stronger,more mature) than an otherwise equal kid born just before that cut off date and therefore have quite an advantage. Almost one year&#39;s growth from 11 years old to 12 can be huge. The bigger and stronger kid would then impress more, be chosen for better teams, get better coaching, play against better opposition, play in more serious and meaningful games, practice more often, and this would compound year after year.<br>He then showed this to be true using mock &quot;play by play&quot; of a major junior game in the Western Hockey League calling players by their birth date instead of their names. It was really well done well and brought home the point he was making. He used real players, their real birth dates, from a real game. And showed how over 60% of the players were born in Oct-Jan, 30% from Feb-May, and less than 10% from June-Sept.<br>I swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.  I was intrigued and looked into other sports with specific cut off dates but found no pattern and became curious. Was this just a &quot;hockey&quot; thing&quot;? I then kinda realized it was odd that Mr. Gladwell pick two teams from a major junior league and not the main professional league (the NHL) so i picked a team at random in the NHL and found no striking correlation, then looked league wide and there wasn&#39;t any. Well, maybe the cut off dates didn&#39;t apply to non Canadians in the league so eliminated them. Still nothing.<br>I looked another comparable league the Ontario Hockey League and again the data didn&#39;t back up Gladwell. So i lastly went back at all the teams in the WHL the same season he used, and only two were heavily rostered by Oct-Dec babies, the two he chose!!!<br>That f ing cherry picking sob i said to myself!<br>I them looked into a couple other claims he made in his books, and found similar things.

Short term memory can only hold up to between 7-10 units of information at a time, so if you have a phone number that goes like 1234567891, you can&#39;t memorize it like that in short term memory because evey single number is one unit of information.

Deliberately practicing and failing at the technique I was after. At some point it would all click, I could suddenly sweep pick a certain scale with relative ease. You cannot stop there. You must continue that new thing learned and play with it to keep it challenging.

It hurts my feelings a bit to hear you compare traders to gamblers. In my case it can&#39;t be further from the truth.  When I look at the market all I do is look for patterns. Take Harmonics for example and Eliott Wave theory....the human physiological element that plays out through these beautiful (math based) patterns in the market shows us this. I think that because the market is heavily manipulated behind the scenes it makes &quot;experts&quot; appear like the weatherman(woman) when they talk &quot;generally&quot; about  the market. We all know that most of the experts in this field (and others) are just paid talking heads.  The experts in the market are the ones who make a living trading (not managing), the ones who know the patterns, the ones who are patient for a setup, and the ones that cut through the &quot;expert&quot; opinions.

If you teach an ADHDr something in one environment, and then change that environment, they won&#39;t be able to recall it. or have a very long time till they are able to recall it.  This becomes especially true with Math as many ADHDrs cant remember the rules of math as they move from one form of math to another.  Take for example learning division, fractions, and ratios. All are based on the same concept, but are broken into distinct areas.   Or, take learning math for fractions and then ask someone to use them in baking.

There are 214 radicals and they&#39;re like puzzle pieces that can be arranged in different ways. The radicals can have a semantic meaning and a phonetic reading. The former will tell you the theme of the word and the latter might tell you how to pronounce it since most characters using that matter radical arrangement are often homophones.<br><br>One way to remember kanji in the beginning is to create stories out of the radicals. \u58ca\u3059 means to break, destroy demolish and is made of \u571f earth \u5341 ten/lid \u7f52 net (just Eye rotated 99\u00b0) and \u8863 clothes.

It&#39;s not at all helpful in this video to repeat this number as if it were true or any accurate measure of time needed for expertise.  It&#39;s not a real number.  It&#39;s bunk science, one of those intellectual myths that needs to die.<br><br>The original research from which that number was drawn was not scientific.  It was a survey of people at varying levels of musical accomplishment, which the researchers already labeled from the start.  There was no prediction and test of that prediction.  There was no study of people from similar starting places showing relative improvement compared against practice time.  It was just a survey of people already labeled &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;novice&quot; or &quot;elite&quot; and &quot;amateur&quot; that asked them to self-report how much they had practiced over their musical lifetimes.  Even as a survey method, it was deeply flawed.  Want a shining example of an &quot;expert&quot; study that utterly failed because the experts running it didn&#39;t give themselves a research model with any meaningful, immediate feedback?  This is it.<br><br>When Gladwell took this research, misapplied it, and promoted a 10,000-hour rule, he was intellectually irresponsible.  The survey didn&#39;t show any such rule.  Gladwell took an already flawed survey and stretched it into something horribly other than what it was.  It was pop psychology that sold well and pushed Gladwell up the NYT bestseller list, but the 10,000-hour rule was a lie.<br><br>Subsequent research has suggested that expertise can come at a very wide range of practice hours.  (One study found anywhere between 728 hours and 16,120 hours of deliberate practice.) There&#39;s also strong evidence that even extensive practice time and the four factors discussed in this video aren&#39;t enough---identical twins show similar aptitudes that fraternal twins do not, suggesting that at least some part of ability is genetic.  Individuals are not all made equally.  No amount of chess practice with feedback in a valid environment, etc., will bring me anywhere close to Magnus Carlsen.  I could become very good at chess, and I can enjoy the game a lot, but even if I practiced well ten times as much as Carlsen has over his lifetime, I&#39;d still not be able to beat him.

The appearance of hues, chroma, and values is an orderly system that can be modeled in your mind, and predicting the behavior of light on form can be made your second nature. so that is the Valid Environment. The Deliberate Practice is satisfied by pushing yourself with the content presented to you from life , you can try to get more detail, more accurate, more quick to a result. Painting from life always has another challenge for you to explore. The Many Repetitions is probably always the most straight forward, in this case you just keep trying your best to get it over and over.<br>     My issue is the Timely Feedback - producing a painting or drawing can take a lot of time and you don&#39;t always get feedback for every mark you make, sometimes you must make many marks or even finish the image to get meaningful feedback.

Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

Now when we practice, we move our fingers in the way that we know is right. It is Intentional, even if it is uncomfortable or unfamiliar at first.

I repeat, the goal of a hedge fund is NOT to beat the market, but to provide SOME returns no matter the market conditions. It&#39;s in the name; they hedge risks. In other words, should a financial crisis occur, a hedge fund must demonstrate some growth (above zero, obviously) while a passive investment such as the S&amp;P500 would decline. Hedge funds don&#39;t exist for the ordinary folks, they exist for a very small subportion of people/companies that need a specific asset class which would not be affected by the broader market conditions as much &amp; yet generate some returns (i.e gov. bonds are also super safe, but their returns aren&#39;t great). Should a crisis come, they don&#39;t take a loss on that investment &amp; have money for other purposes if they pull out from the fund.<br>That being said, hedge funds are often terrible at hedging; and there is also a small minority of funds that provide crazy outsized returns (i.e the Medallion Fund with like 50-60% annual returns for the past decades).", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T07:41:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Onepiece barca", "comment_text": "That anand zapata <br>That&#39;s how my games ALWAYS open so...

This is the best news you\u2019ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It\u2019s not a 12 step program, and don\u2019t think, as many do, that you just have to be a \u201cgood person\u201d or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.

Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ.

Regardless of what you&#39;ve done or what you&#39;re going through you CAN make it through Jesus. <br><br>If you have any questions let me know UXQ9ErQ0IZpGGN9NOnZY8CWja1940ISXEfiNYlG_IPi30mm6eIOjZzUwvfbOX2dz&amp;utm_Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the struggles and madness in this world today, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>Christ says in John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have\u00a0[perfect]\u00a0peace.

I found this for myself while getting feedback on a novel from editors and fellow writers - most things they pointed out were contradictory and often correcting a sentence to the liking of one expert meant displeasing the other expert. So you get to a point where you can get feedback that is frequent and timely but vastly inconsistent. You see the same thing in Goodreads comments: comments praising the exact aspect of a novel that someone else criticized or straight up contradicting each other, like one reader saying the plot is too slow and the other saying it is rushed.

But in things like art or music, the feedback isn&#39;t concrete, as how good something looks or sounds isn&#39;t set in stone. There are smaller things certainly; as a musician I can get feedback from how smoothly I play something, but the overall structure, the pattern of notes that I create in composition or improvisation, isn&#39;t a defined goal. For a beginning musician, that goal may be in learning to play in key, or learning what notes lead naturally into others, but just as often the best pattern for a composition may involve stepping out of the bounds established by playing in key. For painting, you could on one end get feedback on how realistic your painting looks, but if you&#39;re aiming for a style that doesn&#39;t prioritize realism, or creating your own style, there&#39;s not a clear marker of success. It&#39;s not an invalid environment like gambling, but there&#39;s still a level of subjectivity that makes it harder to clearly quantify expertise. For instance, just because someone can play something extremely fast, the melodic structure of their playing may be too repetitive or not match the other players if there are any.

The perfect example are police officers, who can be trained on &quot;extra&quot; information which are not just unnecessary but can also lead to undesired performance. But the outcome can be misconstrued as expertise. In fact, our definition of the best police officer, who think on their feet, tends to be biased. We see this too as overfitting in ML training, where &quot;extra&quot; information (Internet dataset) generalizes the model in the wrong direction. Valid environment in this case wouldn&#39;t be enough, repetitions/feedback can exacerbate bias, and one can deliberately practice with bad habits. Structured data set that outweighs bias is also needed. And this is subject to whether the &quot;game&quot; has perfect information. Training in chess (perfect information) is different from training in blackjack (imperfect information). A pure blackjack player can be an &quot;expert&quot; based only on the 4 criteria, but is considered an amateur compared to an analytical player who also applies statistics, which helps to structure the data set, and an effective filter of learned biases.

Hence the name \u201cHedge fund\u201d as they are hedging against risk. Hedge funds usually have a huge upfront investment amount into the 10\u2019s to hundreds of millions. These people are looking for maximum growth, they\u2019re looking to preserve their money and prevent it from decreasing. Hedge funds deliver on that need by buying securities that go against their primary investment. I\u2019ll explain this better with an example. Let\u2019s say there are two people, person A and person B. Person A has 10k and Person B has 1million. Person A wants to grow their money as much as possible while Person B wants to grow their money, but with less risk. They both invest into the S&amp;P 500 but person B takes another added step, they also invest into an inverse index like the SQQQ for example that mirrors the market (if the S&amp;P goes up the SQQQ goes down). Person B only invests half the amount he put into the S&amp;P into the SQQQ. Now in the hypothetical situation the year has ended and the Market (S&amp;P) has gone up 10% that year. Person A\u2019s investment goes up 10% while person B\u2019s investment only goes up 5%. This doesn\u2019t look like a very good decision by person B until you look at the opposite scenario. Let\u2019s say instead of going up 10% the market falls 10% that year. Now person A has lost 10% while person B has only lost 5%. This is what hedge funds do. They minimize the possible risks for their clients while still maintaining as much growth as possible. Their clients have very different goals than your average investor and in turn produce different results. To become a hedge fund manager for one of these huge funds you are incredible at your job and could easily beat the market if that was your goal. But it\u2019s not their goal and the hundreds of millions these top hedge fund managers make just for hedging against risk is far more than they would make if they chose to try to beat the market.", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T04:49:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Crissyfox Does Stuff", "comment_text": "I am a truck driver and one point you made in the video about deliberate practice is something I notice daily.

So you literally have to process sounds faster than the brain can recognize them.

Did want to elaborate a bit on the Tetlock research though because not all experts were the same in predicting sociopolitical events!<br><br>What Tetlock noticed, broadly, is that experts tended not to do amazingly (as you noted), but there were substantial differences in performance between 2 reasoning styles. He called these &quot;Hedgehogs&quot; and &quot;Foxes.&quot; Hedgehogs tended to look at events more simply: They tended to identify broad, singular causes, make more specific predictions, and were more certain in their beliefs. Foxes, in contrast, considered more complex causal pathways with multiple factors occurring at once; they were less specific in their predictions and more likely to identify contingencies in their predictions (if X then Y, but if A then B). Consequently, Foxes greatly outperformed Hedgehogs over the course of the original study. (Tetlock has even been studying so-called Super forecasters--people who consistently get these rare, complex events right--and has foind far, far more fox-ish tendencies than hedgehog-ish ones). <br><br>To me, this shows that the social world can be predicted (to a point at least; some events are Black Swans).

The optimal strategy is probably to have the primary care doctor prioritize identifying and eliminating the most common explanations, and simply refer patients to a specialist if it turns out to be none of them (which is basically what we see them do already).

However, if I giver her a modal (not tonal) piece by Bela Bartok she will have some problems since the training she did was for tonal compositions. Bart\u00f3k himself realized piano players were &quot;restricted&quot; by the tonal system and published a series of books for piano students with the intention to free them from the major/minor straight jacket.

Some 20 years ago she decided to learn a set of techniques to teach very small children about music - not the notes but the sounds, silence, noise, high and low pitches. She sudied the Kod\u00e1ly method - developed in communist Hungary during the 1950s by a linguist who was friends with Bart\u00f3k, Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly. Kod\u00e1ly used some information from linguistics to develop his method and created, among other things, the mano-sofa (a way to do solfeggio using hand signs that was used - incorrectly - in the Close Encounters of the Third Kind film). In a way, both Bart\u00f3k and Kod\u00e1ly decided to press the red button when they went opposite of the stablished patterns.<br><br>There are areas where expertise exists but the subject is so non linear and noisy even making predictions is impossible.

I learned about Chess, and got to formulate some of my thoughts around expertise and medicine. I do have a quibble though with your comment about experienced doctors vs medical students on two accounts:<br><br>First, number of years is less of a factor compared to what those years were spent doing. Many rare diseases and conditions are such, that if you see a single one in your career you will be able to diagnose it in minutes. I will provide an example I&#39;m fond of this later in the comment. The more time a doctor spends early in their career doing varied tasks and especially overtime, the more learning they&#39;re subjected to through varied and complex patient encounters.<br><br>Second, the inverse of your conclusion is true today. Medical students tend to avoid overtime and any kind of &quot;uncomfortable&quot; work like being on-call. They tend to see interning and residency as necessary evils on the way to being a &quot;real doctor&quot;, as such, they will most likely be objectively worse doctors.<br><br>Okay, example:<br>15 year old male skis down-hill and hits a tree leg-first. The tibia breaks in two parts and the parts become dislodged. He goes into shock, and within an hour or two he is finally at the ICU. The patient is lucid, in pain, and the diagnosis is obvious. The patient is put under anesthesia into a medically-induced coma, the broken bone is realigned, the parts screwed into place, and finally the patient is weened off of the anesthetic and other medications as part of routine surgery.<br><br>The patient fails to recover. The doctor knows that this is trouble and seeks out the local neurosurgeon who is on-call. The neurosurgeon immediately orders a chest CT. The CT shows white dots everywhere in the lungs. The neurosurgeon concludes that these are fatty acids from the bone marrow, which have seeped into the bloodstream, and which the blood thinners (given for surgical purpose) have allowed to get everywhere, including the patient&#39;s brain. Once the blood thinners were weened off, the fatty acids coagulated, blocking blood flow in critical parts of the brain. The patient makes a full recovery. Why a CT of the chest? Because coagulated fatty acids don&#39;t show up well in the brain through CT, and an MRI would take too long to perform in this context.<br><br>This neurosurgeon had seen just one such case in his life, decades ago, while interning in another country. Fact is without this experience the patient would&#39;ve likely suffered severe brain damage. This was not a textbook case, because this series of events just doesn&#39;t happen normally. Especially in smaller healthcare centers.<br><br>I submit to you that the meme/stereotype of medical students catching rare conditions that &quot;experts&quot; miss, is an example of young, excited, passionate will-be doctors interning in complex care wards, whose chief doctors are less passionate about their craft, to whom it&#39;s just a job. I further submit to you that this stereotype is dying, as young doctors today are far less interested in the craft and art of medicine, and far more interested in the glitz, the income, and the status brought on by the title M.D.<br><br>That being said the video is excellent. It gives voice to many people who&#39;re worried about &quot;experts&quot; whether in economics (Europe&#39;s Lost Decade), epidemiology or population health (COVID-19 response or lack thereof), or world politics. People who at the same time follow with great interest &quot;non-experts&quot; - people with education, background and passion, but who&#39;ve been snubbed by the established institutions.<br><br>Hope we can come together more as a world community, and support experts with expertise, not merely titles.", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T01:56:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "General JellyRoll", "comment_text": "If you\u2019re not falling then your not trying anything new", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T01:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allen Xiang", "comment_text": "These four principles are also true to good AI training.", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T01:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sully Chowder", "comment_text": "So basically experience makes an expert, experience that is likely to be repeated or needed in the future.

Each day, out on the boat, I watched those blue lines and red lines and triangles and half-circles and purple dashed lines actually move across the sky, uninterrupted by trees or hills. I got to be quite good at recognizing and predicting the weather \u2013 better than the professionals who did it while sitting at desks. I was out in it every day. <br><br>I paid special attention to hurricanes because I found them interesting. When Hurricane Katrina was moving north parallel to the Florida east coast, a category 1 storm, and predicted to hit South Carolina, I was in Myrtle Beach. I had the Weather Channel on and with more than 10 friends listening \u2013 fishermen who pay attention to the weather \u2013 I predicted Katrina would stop, turn west, cross Florida, and swing around and hit New Orleans. None of the meteorologists or computer models predicted Katrina doing <i>anything</i> like that.

Its usefull for people with a lot of money that waiting for a good opportunity to invest it. If you invest in stocks and get offered a great deal on an asset (ex. a company) while the market is down, you have to choose between selling your stocks at a loss or missing that opportunity. A hedge fund secures against this and reduces the loss in this scenario but thereby limits its profits if the market goes up, so the performace shown in the video is as expected.

I think this kind of content is great because it raises awareness in possible shortcomings in cognition, which for me is the use of &quot;active cognition&quot; or the conscious mind in solving problems and decision making. I&#39;m lazy. I&#39;ve had similar experiences with music as well, once I learn a fun music theory concept or a new song, it&#39;s really hard to not just do that same thing over and over again, the reward for feeling competent at that particular thing is powerful. I think the same concept applies to video game speedrunners as well. The people who top the charts in a game like Super Mario 64 are the ones who are willing to actively grind (with an engaged conscious mind) tricks that are not fun to do at all, but those tricks and movement techniques can really bring your time down and skill level up. I think that this awareness can cause people to be a bit more reflective on their on decisions and how they allocate their time, which I think leads to a better outcome overall. I&#39;d also like to bring up the point that although Buffet&#39;s strategy worked out in this particular bet, it seems to me that the hedge fund strategy would be a better option if your goal is to reduce risk of major losses, as having a team of traders/investors ready to adapt to wild financial conditions (such as 2008 financial crisis) would perform better than index funds in the short term (maybe you&#39;re in retirement or something and don;t want your assets to evaporate), which may just spiral down to zero. Even your data at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA&amp;t=8m43s\">8:43</a> seems to support this claim, the volatility of the hedge fund is clearly less than the index fund.

It&#39;s really cool to understand what it really is that makes an expert.<br><br>That said, I feel the need to defend the economists, journalists, policy and security experts. It&#39;s not these experts aren&#39;t knowledgeable or are deliberately screwing up (although recently, some are doing it on purpose). It&#39;s just that that the economy, elections, and geopolitics are extremely complex systems where one situation is almost never exactly the same as others. There are simply too many factors in these systems to take all of them into account. So the only options are to either ignore them since they had no bearing on similar events in the past, or better yet, try to recognize all of the as many of the factors at play as they can recognize, evaluate which ones seem to be important in the moment, and guess how a similar event in the past could play out under these new conditions. But of course, no one will always be right. <br><br>But that said, a policy expert failing to guess the correct end result isn&#39;t the same as a regular Joe Schmoe guessing wrong. An expert might be correct on 80% of the path towards a certain outcome but just miss the final step, but the average person might be just completely wrong. And the average person can guess the end result correctly but likely can&#39;t correctly explain WHY that result occurred, whereas the expert would likely know where they went wrong in their prediction. <br><br>IMO, I feel like it&#39;s kind of dangerous to say that the average person who might only read the news every once in a while knows just as much as a policy expert who has dedicated their life to the study of these complex systems.

They still lack the experience to determine the actual likelihood of the hypothesis being true and thus are more prone to the default over exaggeration of the layman. Of course they wont be as oversensitive due to the fact they are aware of more negation factors that rule out certain hypotheses which gives some resistance against confirmation bias. But ultimately for the very rarest of scenarios the lack of experience can potentially be an advantage, this will by nature occur very infrequently, but when the truth is on the edge of normal experience it can help else we do tend to narrow the scope of possibilities to those we have experienced over time. I for example will openly admit that I&#39;d probably never manage to diagnose a modern equivalent of the math bug the intel processors once had. I literally have zero experience of this actually existing and I&#39;d probably reach for difficult to confirm or rule out nebulous sources like RF interference before considering the chip may be defective by design as it is so rare.

His combined knowledge of the formations, tendancies and such of the various defenses he faces has become somewhat obvious to him as his longevity and mastery of the game has continued. Now at age 45, with 7 rings, 20+ years of professional game play, &quot;legendary&quot; reputation for game play footage reviews, and more. <br>Not just the G.O.A.T. but an expert!<br><br>2) I played pool at an elite level in my younger years. Often opponents would ask me to &quot;call the 8&quot; at the start of the game. This meant that I would need to tell them what pocket I would be shooting the 8 ball into, thus winning the game. As my time on the tables increased over the years, I realized the game became simpler as the tendancies of the positions of the balls became familiar to me. It made shot selection and strategy much easier.  It was other &quot;expert&quot; players that would discuss this &quot;familiarity&quot; with me, as if we had discovered the secret of life, or the cheat codes within the game. <br><br>3) Memory is a component of intelligence as the chess expert and the 24,000 decimals places of Pi demonstrate, however it is the sub-conscious brain that allows experts to use what the lay-people call &quot;instinct&quot; and to make decisions at an unconscious level that takes them to &quot;expert status&quot;.

When I started, all I saw was numbers. The more I played, the more it looked like an incomplete recognizable pattern (easier to process)  instead of a puzzle. Being an expert in something is literally selling your soul to that cause, the only diff is many can live with that decision and it&#39;s better than actually making a deal with the devil; with any transaction comes a cost (time) and benefit (skill). This brings me to the point that being an expert is not neccessarily the best way in life even tho you might love it so much and at the same time not wish for better because being good at multiple things is always better than being an &quot;expert&quot; in just one. I think alot of people struggling with focus or what is called ADHD isn&#39;t as the media makes it seem because as long humanity has existed, these types of people have lived and excelled in society. I see it more as people being too bored/losing interest with a particularity ( school, work, sports etc..) and not necessarily the ability to focus. Because when presented with constant changing activities in a shorter period ( 2 to 3 years), they significantly perform better at the multiple streams when evaluated than when they are given just 1 particular activity for the same amount of time. In the latter they tend to peak, then plateau and then ofc decline not only in capacity for that activity but also in the overall interest towards that activity. So if being an expert is your thing (10+ years of the same thing while constantly maintaining interest), well go ahead and do your thing. We can&#39;t forget the financial benefits that is rewarded to expertise in demanding fields which is always a bonus. And so If you&#39;re struggling with focus on a particularity, try switching it up or completely. It&#39;s perfectly fine to move on to something else once every couple of years as long as you can afford the cost of changing. Expertise in some sense can be a dedicated form of slavery, and so I try to always follow purpose which is not set by me but by my creator. There is not a particular way to life, but one in &quot;purpose&quot; can be agreed to be the pinnacle of the physical human existence.", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T19:48:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "qwerty 123", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t believe the video with Magnus guessing the second game wasn&#39;t staged - there are literally thousands GM games going from this position", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T19:48:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ichad c", "comment_text": "In the arts and creative industries, getting proper feedback is a real challenge.

Question, though. Do you think that anyone could be the next Magnus Carlsen (for example)? Let&#39;s say you trained a young child to play chess and that child put in the exact amount of training and effort (with the 4 criteria you mentioned) as Magnus, do you think he&#39;d be even half as good? I&#39;d have to think that there are some genetic factors helping Carlsen out here. I mean, he regularly plays against chess player with as many (if not more) hours of qualified practice than him. At 13 he was a grand master and beating players well over 2 or 3 times his age. I get that there is a difference between being a competent expert vs one of (if not) the best in the world at something. However, I feel like the problem with focusing so heavily on this perspective - as well as with Gladwell&#39;s book, is that the standard used to be an &quot;expert&quot; at something is really just being one of the absolute best to ever do it. It&#39;s one thing to be a really good, even accomplished, musician and another to be Beethoven. For example, Gladwell cites the Beatles in his book, not other talented bands from around that same time, like The Everly Brothers - even though in most respects it could be argued that The Everly Brothers were better technical musicians - and they certainly had an influence on the Beatles. Surely there has to be a large social and cultural element that leads to a &quot;right place at the right time&quot; reason for success in many cases as well as genetic abilities that play into excelling at something.", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T19:06:37Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "sogerc1", "comment_text": "The other problem with managed funds is that these experts constantly take their cut from the fund itself lowering it&#39;s gains.

Basically, I&#39;m talking about the common, everyday way you can&#39;t remember something until the memory has been triggered. We do this all the time, but I think the easiest example is musicians. Many  performers, regardless of hours of practice, will still not be able to perform a piece without the sheet music, much less be able to transcribe the piece from memory. However, if you let them look at the sheet music, they are suddenly familiar with every note, every phrase, and they could point to things they couldn&#39;t transcribe and give insight on the way those phrases are supposed to sound and be played. <br><br>Lots of scifi will lead you to believe that every bit of your human experience is still in your brain and with the proper tools or psychotherapy those experiences can be unlocked. That&#39;s obviously a fairy tale, however there is something esoteric and almost <b>magic</b> about the way that we store and recall information so that we can interact with a foreign system in a familiar way, so that the performer is familiar with how to play the notes in a passage without them being committed to working memory.<br><br>Another example - remembering the lyrics to a song after hearing the first few bars<br><br>the way a lookup table that you use frequently feels familiar, but you still need to reference it. &quot;What is the output for 16 again? oh that&#39;s right...&quot;<br><br>The way you can&#39;t blindly recall all the videos you watched today, but if you look at your history you can give insight/feedback about each one.<br><br>My brain does this several times a day and it&#39;s the closest thing to magic I&#39;ve ever seen.

It tells how those 4 criteria came together for me once, and how I started to improve in a competition.<br><br>A while ago, I started playing Brawlyhalla, and I was hoping to play it competitively(I quit it). It&#39;s just a fighting game. If you fight well, you win.<br><br>*It was a regular environment*, because results were decided with clear game rules.<br><br>In something like my first day, I was pressing keys almost completely randomly, and hoping to do something that works. At the same time, I had an experience in my life: in a new situation, reflexes will not work. You may panic and try other reflexes, but they will also fail you. What you should do in such a situation is to calm your brain and try to get quality information about the situation, and derive the action plan using much more general knowledge, like laws of physics instead of how to hit a volleyball; for example.<br><br>So, this knowledge I had was in my mind. In something like my second day, I slowed down. Yes, not trying to hit the opponent or running away may not help in a fight. But I started *practicing deliberately*. And I got my *timely feedback*: I noticed how some strategies were giving very good results, while getting too excited and going back to random key presses were pulling me back very quickly; even in a very good situation.<br><br><br>After a few days of *somewhat many repetitions*, I was really climbing the ladder; tier by tier. The improvements in my gameplay was very clear, and I was only losing momentum when I get too excited or tired or etc. In my early days of deliberate games, I even felt like I was way above that tier, instantly. It was like I had dropped from a very high tier, while I was that tier&#39;s player a day ago.<br><br>Sadly, I was always getting too sweaty while playing that game. So sweaty that it was becoming unbearable for me. So I quit at something like 1200 ELO, or something. I still cannot play fighting games like that.

Being content with what I already knew. <br><br>But stopping there would mean in a relatively short amount of time afterwards, I would no longer be an expert as the information falls into the recesses of my mind. To consistently be working to better yourself seems exhausting, I struggle to imagine how someone could do it their entire life.
