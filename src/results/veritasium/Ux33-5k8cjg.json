And that should happen pretty immediate leaving it with nothing elts to burn as the chain of gasses get spent it should not take 10 billion years to do that you would think it would be pretty damn immediate if nothing is feeding the sun with more energy (gas).So to say something that massive and hot shout burn that all up at once but what do I know.", "comment_date": "2022-09-20T10:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ric Stiles", "comment_text": "Derek, like most science-minded people, the questions never stop popping up.

So how is it that the earth or anything around the sun at that size exists or is at least said to exist 4.5 billion years ago? <br>I think this is a legitimate question.", "comment_date": "2019-07-14T03:19:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N R", "comment_text": "Pfffuuu", "comment_date": "2019-07-13T15:20:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morteza Karimzadeh", "comment_text": "So is the Sun depleting?<br>will it be depleted completely someday eventually?", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T07:12:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juho Kaartoaho", "comment_text": "So sun is basically same as me as in I convert my mass to energy to live, except my fat ass just keeps lobbing in more fuel to burn.", "comment_date": "2019-07-10T06:20:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chakshu Chauhan", "comment_text": "Most of the folks are so dumb \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2019-07-09T05:58:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyladron", "comment_text": "Veritasium, answering the questions you never knew you really wanted the answer too", "comment_date": "2019-07-06T06:18:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vincent DESJARDINS", "comment_text": "doing these videos (plus being objectively charming) seems like a great way to pick up girls ! cute blonde developed an interrest in physics she never suspected ...", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T09:19:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Konr\u00e1\u00f0 Arth\u00farsson", "comment_text": "Along with the proton-proton chain, there is also the CNO cycle, in which it also forms a helium nucleus from hydrogen, but involves Carbon, Nitrogen and oxygen.", "comment_date": "2019-07-02T07:14:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Alex Powers", "comment_text": "So my dumb question for the day is how many kg of H2 are required to run a sun for billions of years, and does the math support the theory based on the apparent sun&#39;s volume?", "comment_date": "2019-06-30T19:01:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Replay Zone", "comment_text": "I hope this was my science teacher", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T10:01:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanisha Khandelwal", "comment_text": "I wish u were a science teacher in our school", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T05:34:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanisha Khandelwal", "comment_text": "Wow", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T05:34:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BobIsNotAPerson", "comment_text": "Now what is a positron and a neutrino?", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T04:39:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Smooa", "comment_text": "Cringe", "comment_date": "2019-06-21T02:11:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mu", "comment_text": "what the heck were we being taught in school then ??", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T17:22:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mu", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux33-5k8cjg&amp;t=0m33s\">0:33</a> steve jobs younger brother....", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T17:13:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ram Raj", "comment_text": "When we burn the wood we get co2 in sky r white smoke.why don&#39;t sun product co2 in space.", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T10:33:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rangsina Timung", "comment_text": "This is the most interesting video I ever seen..<br><br>I really enjoyed watching this video.

Then those so called facts become the justification for more new theories and models and so on. Later, if the first fact turns out to be false, the whole system threatens to collapse. So people start lying to defend those false facts in order to avoid admitting that we have wasted x many decades on false science.<br>So maybe just  please mention it next time if something is a just a theory.", "comment_date": "2018-04-12T14:31:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cybersupernova", "comment_text": "isn&#39;t c stands for speed of causality and speed of light is itself limited by that", "comment_date": "2018-04-11T20:51:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mafarmerga", "comment_text": "And the next cool fact is that the energy released in the form of visible light travels through space, hits a molecule of chlorophyll and this energy is used to fuse carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions into carbohydrates.

Though it might appear to be wonderful but still it is his game only. For instance when some Giani Ji talk about Gurbani, it seems we are very close to Waheguru but when sometimes some of them use their brain to clarify further but they also end up to create confusion also. For instance all the Avatars inclusive of Guru Gobind Singh said that God can create and destroy many universes within a moment which is absolutely right but further clarification in most of the cases when we come down to human beings that an engineer can do design and cannot make buildings till he gets material from outside and many other instances given like this for carpenter,masoanry,carpenter et el which brings the whole thing as said by the avatars to zero level though it might be thought as very good example by Giani Ji, because he has forgotten the basics of God itself otherwise they would have not said so as who have made human beings or human beings are compitiotrs of God . God is omni-present, perhaps we have yet not believed in its true sense as God energy/God is present everywhere and our eye black lese is made up of 50 arabs pixels and each pixle is nothing but a God particle and God is present there too and in each atom of oxygen,metal,plant,human beings and each and every smallest particle of our body (DNA) and whatever is happening in our body/brain,plants,animals,dust,metal, water ,air etc in the whole universe is due to him, then what you talk about the human beings/kings etc is just meaningless and your whole life you have spent saying the similar things which shows either you are simply working for money or you do not have understood Gurbani which is not correct otherwise you would not have explained it. Why I am emphasising it also as you were also saying a few days back that Waheguru naam jahaj hai instead of Nanak naam jahaj hai which have twisted the Gurbani due to lack of knowledge of the poetory who have changed many words of Gurbani and people like you also say like this it is not acceptable as committing mistake is one issue but repeating the same thing intentionally is very serious as saying Mitti Musalman KI as Mitti Beiman Ki and such things are not acceptable to God thoug it is again a part of his game and behind every step of his game are certain lessons. Either really you have not understood the basics of poetory or are scared to talk anything about it as silence is golden which is not true here as only truth is important.. I had to write this as it is my duty to get the things right if unknowingly certan things have happened. When Arjuna saw that many ants have been killed under chariot run by Lord Krishna, he former felt happy and told krishne you have killed many ants and you have also committed sin, then Krishna said I am not responsible for that as I did not know it and you are responsible for it as you had seen it and so you are liable to sin. But who will tell arjuna that God in the avatar of Krishna is also playing some other game and the act of Mukti for ants for which the God had written script crores of years before.. Similarly the incident of one women saying Guru Hargobind singh ji &quot; tum papi mein bakhshanhaar&quot; which was just opposite but Guru Ji had forgiven it as God/Guru are concerned with that is in our mind/soul and here also it is a game of God to convey certain message to others as whatever we are speaking is only God speakng which we do not know and we think we?I am doing it and that is why Sai Baba once said which was then surprising to me also , answering to a question of a 22 years old boy who asked where/who is God and Sai Baba said you are God and I am God but the difference is I know it and you do not know it. Thus whole universe/universes are a part of God even stone/sand/plants/human beings/air/water,heavenly bodies,avatars,aliens,angels and whatever we are seeing is just not a tip of the iceberg and the real things are much ahead of it.<br>n while passing through the plain areas. The water of this river is very pure at himalayas as it is free from impurities like dust, chemicals and bacterias and when it reaches the plan area it gets contaminated due to harmful chemicals pour into it alongwith other various impurities and thus the quality of water in the river gets deterioted and it is further worsen by the time it reaches the ocean. It is not much difficult to understand that it is same river where at the starting point the water is so pure and good for health and thus it gives us life but at the contarary to it, it takes life when contaminated near to ocean. now GOD is te great soul ( or sum total of all the souls) which in its purest form can take a shape of even a God particle i.e. electron,proton,photon,neutron et el but it can do anything within a even fraction of a moment i.e. it can creat crores of universes and anything else which even we cannot imagine. let us talk about this universe and prior to that such situations might have happened unlimited times which only God knows. Then GOD just created God Energy and deseminated in it in the form of the various souls and performs all the activities/functions and whatever is happening in the universes is as per the order/direction of God only. God energy consists of magnetism which can produce,move and destroy anything but all in a logical manner in a scientific way as per the wish of the God. God energy generation is not a one time affair as it is a continuous process. God energy/souls are invisible to our naked eyes mainly but its effects are visible at many places wit/without microscopes/telescopes. For instance black energy as observed by the scientists can produce/destroy the material/substances but it is true for the whole universe even on earth also that it is God Energy only as per the directions of GOD that produces every materialistic things,Whatever we are seeing in an atom/cell etc is due to these energies only which are moving,prodcing/ destroying . A laser beam is also a part of God Energy like electricity and gravitational force like crores of other such <a href=\"http://energies.do/\">energies.Do</a> not be under any misunderstanding that the earth is pulling everything towards its center due to gravitational force rather it is a pushing force which is a combination of two energies i.e. North-South magnetic energy and radial magnetic energy. In religious terms God energy is OM/ONKAR , EK NOOR and ither/flux r nature et el. And the whole universe is connected completely through these energies. Even ideas to our brains are coming from other super souls as our soul has an abode in the brain at one gram sized mass which drives our body and this is also known as mind,third eye, tisri ankh etc. God energy forms our body and runs our body system on a continuous basis and all the activities are done by it only which we think as if we are doing it and so those who have known it has said NOTHING to themselves as God is doing everything. This universe is just a small game for the God and whatever is happening to us is also happening to God as it is happening to God energy too. This universe is working on a very small motions as far as for GOD it is concerned as he can do anything within a moment. Most of the universal mysteries will be clear to you once you know as to how these energies function/move this universe. For more details you can visit my 13 videos on youtube under &quot; God energy by satnam wadhwa&quot; if you feel like and this is not the only birth for us as it is very lone journey of souls which are very very powerful but what we know as human beings is just nothing though we might be boasting of it too much. And God is omni-present,omni-potent but will appear to us only when we will reach the level of truthfulness when cheating,greediness,looting,cleverness etc will go from our life and all this will happen when God will wish it and never forget our journey and we are getting/losing as per that only and it is applicable to all of us but we might be at different stages of it and getting and losing accordingly as God is not partial to anyone.<br> <br>Like<br>Comment<br><br><br>DO YOU KNOW THE THEORY OF COLOUR FORMATION IS NOT CORRECT COMPLETELY --- We might have heard about that the Sun light has seven basic colours which is not correct correctly and even we do not know as to why / how these colours are formed from the white / yellow sun light or from other sources as we are yet not aware about the basic theories of God energy which forms this. This is true that different colours have different wave lengths or in other words if we can change the wave length then the colour of the light wave can be changed. But what is the wave length really and most of us are not clear about it . As we think that Sun rays are coming to us in wave form/sine wave and starting point to end point of it in length is called wave length but in reality the sun rays are coming in circular / rotary form and one cycle of motion forms wave length but it is also equivalent to the former. When these rays fall on any other thing and change its direction the size of the circular changes and hence wave length changes and so the colour changes. Similarly when the light rays pass through it the wave length of it changes due to the slanted side of the prism as the light rays coming in will have to move the different distance within the same time due to the same force of sun rays and other side being slanted, the rays move with different speeds inside the prism and hence the size of circular diameter of the rays changes and hence th", "comment_date": "2018-01-14T15:01:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Satnam Wadhwa", "comment_text": "GOD ENERGY -- OVERVIEW<br><br>It is all being done by God energy i.e. creation,maintenance and destruction of anything in the universe i.e starting from God particles to galaxies to the universe and further too. This energy is there everywhere i.e in the empty space as we see and even in the space between neutrons and electrons too and in fact the electrons are moving due to this only like earth to solar system to galaxies to the universe. And what we are seeing is just a small part of the whole thing and in the absence of God energy theory which is the real science and the science we call it is a small part of it as the real happenings are not visible to us which are more complex and mysterical. Do not be happy to know that voyagers are moving just as it is by your energy arrangements as the fact is the whole solar system is being moved by these energies in a logical manner and same is true for reaching to moon,,,,mars, ISS and everything inclusive of black hole and we are also in the similar powerful energy but it is all logical/scientific way as why we are surviving as only a very very small portion is being released to run our body/brain otherwise you can understand the energies power in oxygen/hydrogen/liquid fuels/ nuclear, uranium etc to name a few and what level of energy is released from it as they have been made from these energies only by forming atoms due to two energies protons/neutrons and electrons by moving in a particular way as God energy is a basically magnetic one which can produce any number of God particles and it is all happening in a controlled manner. This is the same energy which on concentration act as a laser and can destroy anything within a moment. Thus the whole universe can be produced and destroyed by these God energies within a moment only. Electricity is also a part of God energy which is not visible to us and it can do wonders and can run the train too and same thing is happening in the universe and gravitational energy is also the similar energy which is running the earth and producing everything on earth and we are also functioning due to that only. This is a long story and everything cannot be written here and for more details you can watch the 13 videos on God Energy by satnam wadhwa and clarify your doubts. Things will be very simple after knowing these facts with animated film which will clarify all your doubts which otherwise you will not know with only your ways as your are concentrating only on the electric train and are forgetting the electricity in a simple way. Frankly speaking we have yet not understood the basic principle of generation of electricity as from where the energy is coming through the magnets and why it becomes electricity and why again electricity can become magnetism and if we make crores of researches on the individual items or take lakhs of Ph.D degrees or get thousands of Nobel Prizes, even then we cannot find the truth behind the working of the universe till we understand the theory of God energy and I do have answers for all those mysteries which we are trying to find out since inception of the universe which is with a very humble way I am saying as I feel bad when the scientists/ other people are making a lot of efforts to search the truth but are going in the wrong or imperfect directions.<br><br>God energy theory will prove Newton and others as wrong................... as the God energy is working on a totally different principle. Even solar system has sun working independently and earth and other planets are working and moving in the orbits which is a part of the whole solar system where interplanetary space has equal or even more powerful energies which are keeping the planets at the same distance forever. Think at least now as to how the voyager has gone to the outer space of the solar system and do you really agree that the energy sources provided in the voyagers are really adequate to take it too far away and it is still continuing and these energy sources are only adequate to give some energy to voyager in the rotating solar system to other orbits just like it is done while reaching the Mars and it was done in Mangalyaan of india without any real knowledge of functioning of interplanetary motions due to God energy which is moving and is responsible to carry the Mangalyaan from the outer periphery of earth unit to mars&#39;s outer periphery and it is applicable to voyager too but it had to cross many planets to reach the outer periphery of the solar system which also proves the rotary motion of the solar system otherwise even Mangalyaan and voyagers would not have gone to mars and other planets/outside the solar system respectively. My dear friend do not think that the space which seems to be blank/empty is just powerless/energyless but even most of it is more powerful. Your most of the theories are just funny only .These energies are being produced continuously and this is how sun is giving us energy continuously and it is true for the whole universe and nothing is happening in an accidental way as everything is controlled and has a certain purpose even the electron/proton/neutron/photon and do not forget that it is only a neutron which causes bomb to explode in uranium in a fission process and spirituality ,science/physics/chemistry etc all have come from God energy which is one of the options of the God as it can use many such other options to create universe or similar spaces and it might be true that before the big bang God was like an electron or smaller than this and with one idea it has made the many universes and even before the electron like size, God was spread like any other universe for million and million of years and like this God was something else or other prior to this for many many times. God;s miracles are much more beyond God particles and there are some other worlds which are beyond our imagination. This universe is a small game for him and it is every where or omni-present and talks to the purest human beings too.<br><br>Until and unless, we understand the theory of the God Energy we cannot understand the functioning of the universe. God in its original / purest form is nothing but the sum total of all the souls which are present everywhere through the God energy which is created by the God and it is present everywhere and is being produced on an ongoing basis. Whatever is happening in the universe is due to God Energy + Souls = God. God energy is the same thing and known by other different names and we have not yet understood them too clearly which are for instance Ek Omkar / Om / Ek Noor / Magnetic flux / ether et el. The creation of God energy only resulted in big bang creation or in other words this energy only made all the visible/materials/heavenly bodies, set them in motion in a logical way and is responsible to provide their maintenance and destruction too. It is happening since its inception and still is going on and we are only in a position to see a small part of it. God energy is basically a magnetic energy which can do anything i.e creation of materials through the God particles i.e. protons/electrons/neutrons/photons etc which form atoms to molecules and thus materials and God energy has all the properties we see everywhere i.e. memory,consciousness, super power and it can destroy anything too like a laser beam which is also a part of God energy. Thus for the formation of any substance there is a need of minimum two energies just like one is proton/neutron and other is electron and it is singlr type of energy which act as a laser beam when concentrated. Thus the working of the universe is dependent on the God energy and its quantum,speed , direction are basically responsible for making the universe and all it happens with the order of God through the various souls. Some more instances will clarify it in a better way. What is visible to us i.e. hardware is all created by the invisible energy i.e. software which is working in a logical way / real scientific manner as it is the real science which we have yet not imagined and most of us arre confused about the happenings in the universe..Things are much more complex than as it seems to us which you will know soon. Nothing happens freely in this universe and everything has certain purpose as even a single God particle is not produced by the God/God energy without any use and this is the control of God. The creation of this universe itself is a small game of the God or is one of the options available with God.<br>With due respect to all as everything is happening due to God energy/God as all the souls are also like God energies and are more conscious and can travel anywhere within no time, our findings like law of motions,time travel, Newton and Einstein and others theories are not exactly correct as everything is being done by God/God energy in a logical way and that is yet not understood by us. And the confusion prevails which is a part of the game of God and it will give knowledge gradually otherwise it will have to close/wind up this universe. It is true that whole universe is full of powerful energy which are moving with different speeds in different directions and can produce and destroy anything within a fraction of moment. So time travel is also due to these energies<br>To understand the working of these energgies let us take a simple example as everything in the universe is happening due to these energies only or whatever is happening to them is being transformed / tranferred to us too and example is say there are different qualities of roads made up of clay/cement concrete etc with rough or smooth surfaces and a lot of different vehicles are travelling on it say cars,lorries,tractors,buses, light or heavy commercial vehicles. So if someone has to travel from one point to another and the time taken will depend upon the various factors i.e the type of vehicle or speed of it, route of road, quality of road etc are the factors which will affect the time taken and the similar", "comment_date": "2018-01-14T14:53:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr Aakash Rajput", "comment_text": "Where did you find your goats.Actually I don&#39;t know, all question which do you ask ,beacause I am 8th standard student but I try to understand", "comment_date": "2018-01-14T06:58:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Reese", "comment_text": "sponges are the fundamental mechanism behind nuclear fusion. that&#39;s quite enlightening.", "comment_date": "2018-01-14T03:58:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rays rays", "comment_text": "Very easy, I think I knew it when I was 12 years old", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T12:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Merrill", "comment_text": "He got way too much fun when the balls collided", "comment_date": "2018-01-03T07:22:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kenneth McKenzie", "comment_text": "inside the sun matter is ripped apart. quantum physics remembers entanglements, keeping the sun from being too hot to maintain its state of collapse. as the particles reach the chromosphere, they are reunited according to entanglements. that is why the chromosphere is so much hotter than the surface of the sun. if all the matter reactions happened inside the sun, it would expand to the point of non-function. sun as battery.", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T15:02:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spidy Games", "comment_text": "When sun relises energy it lose mass than my question is one day it has no mass left do you mean that???????", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T09:13:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roko3131", "comment_text": "...was the earth a piece of the sun?", "comment_date": "2017-12-26T19:27:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Refuge G", "comment_text": "THICKOS", "comment_date": "2017-12-21T04:04:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saleha Iqbal", "comment_text": "From where do you get all these stupid people?", "comment_date": "2017-12-16T18:57:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhishek Patil", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux33-5k8cjg&amp;t=3m40s\">3:40</a> XD", "comment_date": "2017-12-15T12:44:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashen Gamage", "comment_text": "This Is great asking questions from people it is so funny and educational.", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T11:28:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bradley Allen", "comment_text": "&quot;Hate*...light.&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-12-04T03:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Helena Saldric", "comment_text": "I knew that c=speed of light.

The suns ratio of surface area, compared to its volume, causes ambient radiation to slow as it approaches the sun. As ambient radiation slows, it can create massive gravity, a lot of heat, and light. <br><br>We know once again that gravity is just a pushing force. We know that large objects appear to have gravity associated with the area around their location. So we must suspect that the planet creates a less repulsive force than the space above it. <br><br>I was taught, the planets surface because of the small surface area compared to large volume, creates a bottle neck for ambient radiation. Ambient radiation bound for the planet, is slowed as it approaches that bottle neck at the surface. Inside the planet the ambient radiation is accelerated in a shortage of ambient radiation. It is this small difference of abundance of ambient radiation on the surface and shortage in the planet that creates gravity. This process is very much like an electrical circuit, anything caught between the planet and space, is pushed to the planet. <br><br>The proximity to the planet causes an object near a planet, to become abundant with particles of electricity. Ambient radiation is just particles of electricity so you get repulsion towards the planet. The only mystery that I doubt we will ever solve is why particles repel one another. <br><br>With the sun you also get heat, from this bottle neck of ambient radiation at the surface of the sun. The sun should go on forever without some kind of unforeseen incident. Ambient radiation is the power for all things, light, heat, ultra violet, and explosions. Matter itself is actually power less, it has no potential energy When caused to become high in voltage, matter can then move, be heated, and give off light. However the matter has no power. Matter is like a sail, ambient radiation the wind. <br><br>We live in a perpetual motion universe. <br><br>If you stand near a large plastic bag of oxygen and acetylene, right before it is detonated, there is an artificial gravity created. That pushes your body into the bag of yet undetonated gas. As the bag detonates it gives off a bright white flash, very similar to the sun. Before the light from the explosion there is a large amount of Ultra Violet radiation that is created towards the bag of yet undetonated gas. <br><br>The earths surface is abundant with particles of electricity, from the bombardment of ambient radiation from space. This causes the surface to raise in voltage, actual voltage. This voltage which is higher than the voltage of clouds or space, is conducted to the surface of a cloud. The cloud in some cases, like a rain cloud, cannot pass the current through the surface of the cloud. And an ARC (Anode, Rectified, Cathode) is created at the surface of the cloud. Just like a welding ARC rod, melts and reciprocates with a ray back against the flow of the power supply. In the case of the cloud you get lightning. <br><br>It is all an electrical effect. Nothing is ever lost, no matter has ever been destroyed, no energy has ever been used or lost, it is just redirected, moved, or altered. No two particles have ever touched one another. I can pass a lie detector after slapping someone in the face that I never touched their face with my hand. But I grew up in a very different place, with the science, Hitler, Truman, and Churchill did not want the world to know. <br><br><br>Sincerely. <br><br>William McCormick", "comment_date": "2017-04-22T03:54:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Lemmon", "comment_text": "fusion ppl.", "comment_date": "2017-04-22T03:14:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bulbadox", "comment_text": "its astounding all these students are dullards.", "comment_date": "2017-04-21T16:35:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shyam butani", "comment_text": "showcasing dumb people... don&#39;t know what c is in e=mc2....!! wtf", "comment_date": "2017-04-20T15:11:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mustafa Emre Basaran", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t intend to be rude, but why do you only include peope whose responses are incorrect.

There is no O2 on the sun. O2 is needed for something to burn. Another thing it needs, is fuel. CH4? Can&#39;t be there. It is just like in Chernobyl. The nuclear reactions are exothermic reactions (Not sure if that is the right therm. It is &#39;exotherm&#39; in dutch). The heat it produces makes it so hot that it becomes Plasma. It is slowly &#39;burning up&#39; though. Eventually it&#39;ll loose all it&#39;s energy. But it is so big that it will take a long time before it is out of energy.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux33-5k8cjg&amp;t=2m03s\">2:03</a><br>H+. Everything is made up of H+. I thought it were unstable atoms like U and that that was how they lost energy. But now I remember that it is H+. I&#39;m thinking that they will become a proton together and loosing the energy by making an electron in a wierd way. Or they become neutral after they send away an electron. Maybe they change their speed to energy we can see. But that does not explain why it is an exothermic reaction...<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux33-5k8cjg&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a><br>E=mc^2<br>Energy=mass x (speed of light)^2<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux33-5k8cjg&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a><br>H+ and H+ makes H2(2+). A little bit of the weight it looses is conferted to e-. More then one e- are made during that process. I was talking about this before.<br>H2(2+) + 2e- -&gt; H2.<br>That isn&#39;t helium. It is just H2.<br>I fall back to my second theory I had on your question at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux33-5k8cjg&amp;t=2m03s\">2:03</a>. H+ and H+ collide. They loose energy and make some e- during the fusion. The 2H+ will become N (neutrons). The 2 Neutrons will attract two H+. Making it He2+. That with the electrons make He.<br>He makes life possible.
