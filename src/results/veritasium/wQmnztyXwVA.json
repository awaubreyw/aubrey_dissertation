It is true that radiation is harmful and damaging in quite a few ways but the two different types are negative in different ways.<br><br>For example: Ultraviolet (UV) rays are the main cause of sunburn and most skin cancers, however the ozone layer (where there is 2-3x the oxygen particals) can obsorb this radiation.<br><br>Infrared radiation is the main cause for heat. It passes through the layers of the atmosphere  and hits the soil of Earth. It is then somewhat obsorbed by the soil and then reflected back into outer space.<br><br>Both types of radiation come directly from the sun in electromagnetic waves where it is then formed into visable and invisable light or radiation.<br><br>Therefore radiation is bad in a way, however it is not always the cause of cancer.

If we would presume all of this, your last reason why it woudn&#39;t be able to go faster than light was this: The atoms, or better yet, the electrons that keep everything together are moving at the speed of light, and if the tip would be moving FTL, the electrons woudn&#39;t be capable of holding it together. Now think of a car which is moving with 100km/h, the air inside is stationary(as far as it can be) to the rest of the car. While there would be a difference in speed for the tip and something a meter closer, this difference woudn&#39;t be the speed of light and as its all inside the container(of the rod) the electrons woudn&#39;t be ripped away from eachother.<br><br>Somewhere there, I must have made a mistake, could you point out or explain where that faulty way of thinking lies, excuse me if I wasn&#39;t clear enough^^.<br><br>-Jelle<br><br>Ps, If you need another idea for a video, could you do one on all the states of matter, I know you have done one bout the 3 states.

It turned out there 7 times more radiation outside than inside. I thought everyone knows this staff till I saw this video... The other thing I would like to be in this video is how does radiation actually damage our cells. It wasn&#39;t clear that the damage actually come from ionization. When exposed to high doses the ionization causes quick death to our cell, not the damaged DNA. Radiation poisoning has nothing to do with mutation - it causes death much quicker!!! Mutations and damaged DNA are bad things caused by ionization too. They may cause cancer or just cause cell death in long run. But those things may happen even without radiation due to some extra oxygen in our cells, or some free radicals. Radiation just increases likelihood of those radicals to appear. Under high doses concentration of those radicals increases to so high number so they literally destroy the cell, without giving it enough time to mutate and cause cancer.

This is true with high-level radiation that doesn&#39;t outright kill you, but we simply don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true with low-level radiation.

Maybe they&#39;re right. The other camp believes that the reason we aren&#39;t detecting them is simply because they are not happening at all, or if they are happening, they&#39;re buried under other, much more substantial causes of cancer.

People seem to not understand some basic scientific principles, such as radiation not always meaning harmful waves. Light bulbs emit radiation, anything above 0K emits radiation. \n\nAnother large area of scientific lack of understanding involves the term &quot;chemicals.&quot; I often overhear people claiming they won&#39;t consume certain foods and drinks because they are &quot;full of chemicals.&quot; Well what do you eat?
