However, this immune system suppression may also lead to more cancers.  Interestingly, UV tends to <b>increase the innate</b> immune system, useful for bacterial infections. And while long term UVA exposure is associated with Accelerated Aging/skin cancer, even low doses of UV are associated with keratinocyte/non-melanoma skin cancers.   But on the flip side, UVA appears to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of CVD.     Most surprisingly, however, is that while short high exposure of UVB can lead to menaloma skin cancers, it may help with weight loss.. DESPITE the fact that UVB prevents the HFHSD-induced Uncoupling-Protein-1 in Brown-Adipose-Tissue from activating.. so the weight loss must be due to something else (UV-induced cytokines like IL-33, NitricOxide, Hydrocarbon signaling in the Liver, etc).<br><br>BTW, Chris Masterjohn mentions how ultraviolet destroys riboflavin (as does losing weight/exercise)!

Australians have figured out that it is not the exposure to UV rays that causes aging and cancer, it is the random and infrequent exposure that is the problem. Allowing the body to naturally produce vitamin D from exposure to UV rays on a frequent basis over time will provide a natural protection from developing cancer and reduce photo aging. Putting on sunblock prevents the natural production of vitamin D. If you are going to use sun block get some sun first, depending on your skin pigmentation, you may need more exposure than others but the key is the frequency of the the limited exposure.  Also there is a natural sunblock that will protect you from the inside out. Astaxanthin which is a carotenoid, protects the skin from both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Consuming this fat soluble antioxidant over time will give you better protection than titanium oxide which is the active ingredient in most sunblock products.

However, I&#39;d like to see a more wholistic approach including on the one hand the benefits of radiation which are Vit D production and regulation of circadian rhythms. On the other hand I thonk you should illustrate the machanisms that prevent these damages occur - antioxidants from fruits and vegetables as well as how to boost immune function and cell health by diet and lifestyle. As I see it the reasonable exposure to UV radiation (time limited oder with sunscreen) per se is a good thing and does not cause cancer if the bodies own protective measures are working properly.

Then explain to us how the slaves survived spending all that time in the sun without being covered in skin cancer? Then explain how there is no skin cancer issues in countries where the people can not afford or even use sunscreen. Do Mexican have a skin cancer issue? What about people in India?
