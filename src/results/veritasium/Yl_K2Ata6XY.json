One, is size. Tiny wild strawberries are loaded with flavor, but commercial strawberries are gigantic in comparison and have less flavor and nutrients. People will avoid any fruit with even a tiny bruise, so peaches and other fruit are picked before they are ripe, still hard, and harder to digest and receive the nutrients (unless you are a ruminant).<br>People also like sweet food, so modern breeds are loaded with sugar.  The article mentioned the new \u201cPeaches \u2018n\u2019 Cream\u201d hybrid variety of sweet corn (now the only variety available in most markets) which has high sugar content, but almost zero nutrients. You\u2019d get more nutrients from a Snickers bar.<br><br>But the main reason food is less nutritious can be summed up in one word: shelf life. (OK, two words.)  Fully ripened, soft, juicy peaches have a shelf life of &lt;two days at room temperature. No store will stock produce that they end up throwing out in two days.  Modern breeds of produce are bred for long shelf life, and the easiest way to do this is to breed all the nutrition out of the produce and pick it before it ripens.  Nutrients are just as beneficial to germs (bacteria, fungi, mold, insects, &amp;c.) as they are to humans, so the germs thrive on nutritious food, quickly rotting it. Milk and eggs are highly nutritious foods, so they won\u2019t even last a week, even when refrigerated. But California Iceberg Head Lettuce has no nutrition at all, so it will last in the produce bin for a month. That\u2019s why your supermarket stocks it. <br><br>Old (heirloom) breeds of fruit have more nutrition and superior flavor. Old varieties of apples such as Russets and King (also called Thompkins King) are wonderful in flavor and crispness, until they spend a week in the grocer\u2019s bin where they quickly dry out.  <br>We don\u2019t get protein from vegetables, Derek. We make our own protein from the amino acids they contain, and as Mr. Glen Oble, my high school biology teacher taught us, amino acids are typically colorful, so food with natural color is generally more nutritious.  <br>But the average customer is reluctant to try a weird-looking fruit or vegetable. The varieties the Times article charted as high in nutrition were purple carrots, purple potatoes, blue corn.  Americans would rather buy high-sugar, normal looking food.<br>The most nutritious and readily available vegetable according to the article?  Dandelions!  And the old Lebanese immigrants in the neighborhood here can be seen in vacant lots picking them.  On a daily walk, I\u2019ll pick a dandelion flower and snack on it \u2014 but not the bitter green part: that must be cooked.", "comment_date": "2022-09-09T06:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Gonzalez", "comment_text": "Stop labeling fat as bad.

Those fertilizers do nothing for soil health worms and other good creatures can&#39;t live of this, and without them the soil gets compacted = why farmers need to till the soil but this will kill of even more worms creating this bad cycle where the soil just gets more and more compacted. Plus since they don&#39;t add new organic material except those small bits from the last crop that gets tilled down the soil just gets worse and worse. Organic farming is a bit better but it&#39;s not as free from chemicals as one would think and some organic fertilizer is not better then conventional when it comes to washing away and not leaving anything for worms and such to live of and they might not add any organic material either so the soil can deplete even there. <br><br>In a home garden you can add grass, leaves and other materials to the beds so it can release some nutrients over time but mostly feed worms they will airate the soil bring organic materials deeper and worm poo is really nutrient rich, my own mature older beds that gets constantly improved are super soft to dig in thanks to the worms, the soil is also really heavy because it can hold so much water it&#39;s completely different from the soil in the fields surrounding my home where the soil is dense but quite light. I also make my own fertilizers just by pressing down a bunch of weeds in a water barrel and then add some water and let the weeds melt, that way you add back the nutrients from the weeds including vitamins, minerals and ofc NPK aswell so its a better fertilizer than those that add just the essential, but it requires a lot of weeds just to cover a small area and I don&#39;t see how it would be possible to scale this up to be doable with how much a farmer would need. <br><br>I would really like a comparison study between someone who&#39;s beds are made like a h\u00fcghelculture or something similar with a lot of organic material, compost and so on compared to organic farming, regular farming  and hydroponics.

One can easily check whether soil depletion is a factor, by comparing crops grown in brand-new fields to crops grown in old fields. He leaves that out completely.<br>2. He also says the farmers are careful to fertilize the soil...but he doesn&#39;t address the major flaws in HOW they refertilize the soil. <br> a. that they largely focus on a few major nutrients, like nitrogen. He mentioned mineral decline in food...do farmers even remineralize the soil? <br> b. And even those who do, is it the same as the naturally occurring minerals? Note that science has recently shown that human beings taking mineral supplements may not be able to actually process and use those minerals like they do when the same minerals are present chemically in food. Perhaps the same is true of some fertilization. Perhaps some or all of the nutrients, because they are chemically a bit different than when they occur in soil otherwise, aren&#39;t as accessible.<br> c. He talks about &quot;still getting big plants&quot;, but different nutrient deficiencies may produce different outcomes. Perhaps there is a nutrient problem that doesn&#39;t change plant size, only chemical composition. <br> d. Not only that, but perhaps the plants ARE smaller than they would be without depletion, because having been bred for size, that lesser growth is hidden behind how much larger they now are genetically.<br>3. He asks about plants not selectively bred, then he skips over the BEST version of this: Heritage/heirloom cultivars. Not only can one find cultivars of plants NOT bred to improve over the past generations, but one can even find old seeds that still germinate, generations later. THAT is the best way to test whether breeding changed things.<br>4. Honeybees are invasive. So if honeybees focus on native goldenrod as a food source, that would be a harmful breeding influence on the plant.<br>5. He mentions the dilution effect solely in context of CO2. A money-maker to focus on, but completely unscientific when one considers that the plants are growing at DOUBLE their rates and sizes versus a century ago MAINLY because of the genetic breeding to MAKE them grow faster. If growing 30% more because of CO2 could reduce their nutrient value, how about growing 100% faster because of their genetics?<br><br>Oh, and how can he not know how to pronounce &quot;produce&quot;?", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T17:04:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mo S", "comment_text": "They&#39;re using chemical fertilizers.

With more and more research published nutrionists have decreased and decreased the recommendations. Protein deficiency was never a problem and will certainly be one of the last problems that will arise in the field of nutrition. Instead many people consum to much protein and even get sick.<br><br>2) Satiety is a lot more complex than proteins = fullness. Studies have shown that low-protein plant based meals have the same amount of satiety/fullness than high-protein animal based meals, with high-protein plant based ones even higher.

Fertilizers are a huge expense in farming. (I grew up on a farm and still live in a farming community). The fertilizers added only cover a small few key nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium are the ONLY nutrients added to most crops). This helps the plant to grow big and fast, but causes it to become less nutrient dense (less vitamin C for example) and more susceptible to disease and pests. Thus, increasing the need for pesticides, which when ingested, causes our bodies to use more nutrients to neutralize the toxins. The faster a plant grows (which Co2 and fertilizers cause) the fewer nutrients and anti-oxidants it will produce as it is using all of it&#39;s energy to grow, but not to maintain health.

Meaning that there are more, bigger, plants competing for the CO2. Especially as that high concentration of vegetation has existed consistently in that same area for multiple seasons, making the air less CO2 rich over time. So high demand creates a supply deficit while demand remains constant. There\u2019s also less CO2 producers on farmland. Animals are kept away from crops, and because all the land is covered with crops, there\u2019s less CO2 producing technology as well. Keep in mind that CO2 producing urban areas tend to be pretty far away from rural farmland.

That is, those countries that spray poisons as well as use synthetic fertilizers create an imbalance by killing off one of the two major microorganisms (sorry, I forgot if it was the Bacteria or Fungi that got killed off) and their plants have a marked less nutrient component than those that do not spray their crops. This also makes sense, because crop poisons etc. were (at least for Europe) really only introduced with the revolution of farming in the post war years (and also started to see the decline of insect life). This is interesting, since we know by now that a gut dysbiosis will create a nutrient deficiency in human beings, so also, it would seem at least, that this is also true for plants.

But there is clear correlation between the rise of pesticides and the rise of autism, Alzheimer&#39;s, cancer, all the autoimmune diseases, arthritis, etc. You think plants out in the wild without pesticides just are feasted upon by insects non stop? Lol, no. If that were the case the entire planet would have been turned into a desert long before modern human agriculture was a thing. They have their own defenses and they can be thought of like the exterior microbiome, the gut microbiome, and the immune system of humans.

Ives", "comment_text": "The place where we are losing nutrients are in our animal foods. The key place this loss is seen is in &quot;amino acids&quot;. There are nine essential amino acids, and the primary, most reliable source for those essential amino acids is animal foods. This means that without those amino acids being obtained through food, our bodies cannot, and will not be able to obtain them or create them in any other way. If you look at the effects of what the essential amino acids do for the body, but then invert their effects, you will end up with a list of symptoms that you would find in &quot;autoimmune diseases&quot;. <br><br>Example: How many people below the age of thirty have arthritis (which is an autoimmune disease)? How many of those people also have another corresponding, more severe autoimmune disease? Arthritis is very common among people with other autoimmune diseases. Based on what I stated before, there must be an inverse to arthritis among the list of the essential amino acids. That answer is Methionine, the only sulfur based essential amino acid. And it specifically is used by the body for joint health, and for joint lubrication, among other uses. <br><br>But you can probably notice that this should not seem to be a problem. But a few facts have not been stated yet. Did you know that amino acids are destroyed when they are frozen? Simply by freezing amino acids you nearly destroy all of their nutritional value. So here are the questions you should ask...<br><br>When did the freezer become a common household appliance? Then compare that to when the term &quot;autoimmune disease&quot; was classified due to its increasingly noticeable presence. When did we start processing our milk, rather than delivering fresh, raw milk? And was there a noticeable increase in autoimmune disease cases, and types around that time? When did the farming industry start feeding chickens plant foods only instead of their natural diet of bugs? And was there a noticeable increase in autoimmune disease around that time? When a fad called &quot;veganism&quot; started becoming popular, was there a corresponding increase in autoimmune disease in children? <br><br>If you do not ask the correct question, you will not find the needed answer.

The fact is, topsoil around the world is disappearing, turning into lifeless dust. The reasons for that are complex and multitudinous, but current industrial agriculture practices, including the over-use of industrial biocides and fertilizer, are contributing to that. To skip over that point is disingenuous.

Plants left in their natural state would have had to store their own nutrients, naturally fertilizing them, along with resting the land wouldn&#39;t effect this natural process much.

But, this video is making me think again about the quality of the information (is this fellow a CO2 nut?).  LET ME PRESENT THE REAL PLANT SCIENCE!  First, plants are very dependent on bacteria and fungi and other micro organisms in the soil.  For example, fungi that surround a plants roots increase what the roots do by 10 to 1000 times.  The bacteria and fungi do most of the heavy lifting for the plant, as they are very adept at sourcing the minerals that the plant needs to grow properly.  Plants produce sugars from photosynthesis (CO2 is needed for this).  A substantial amount of the sugars that plants produce go to feed the bacteria and fungi in the root zone;  sometimes up to 30 percent of the total sugar the plant produces.  Some plants can even change the kind of sugar they produce to feed a different kind of fungi if the plant senses it needs to.  (YES!  The DNA coding in plants is unbelievable!)  With modern farming they use a tremendous amount of man-made fertilizers to feed the plants.  These fertilizers make the plant grow well, but they also kill off the bacteria, fungi, and other micro-organisms in the soil and kill or drive out the earthworms.  You end up with soil that is sterile and needs even more fertilizers to produce the same amount of food.  Read Jeff Lowenfels book on all this, &quot;Teaming With Microbes.&quot;  The bacteria and fungi are far more adept at getting the proper minerals for plant growth than the roots themselves are.  And if they ain&#39;t there then you end up with plants that look good but lack the nutritional value, and a lot of the taste in food comes from the minerals being there to begin with.  Commercial fertilizers are all in salt form.  Salts bind water to themselves.  Bacterial and fungi require water, and if the fertilizers are binding up the water then they are killed out.  The turning of soil into hardpan is a big problem now days all across the country, as farmers are destroying the soil due to their practices.  It ain&#39;t CO2 folks!  Maybe Al Gore or some other goon has paid for the making of this video.  CO2 is PLANT FOOD, and is used to make microbe food.  Commercial growers of cannabis indoors often use CO2 generators to up the CO2 levels from 400 ppm to 1200 to 1500 ppm because the limiting factor in photosynthesis is usually the amount of CO2 that is available.  If there is enough light in the correct spectrums and enough water then you get bigger, stronger, and healthier plants by upping the CO2 and stronger ganja in the end.

Adding nitrogen, potassium and sodium, the main ingredients of commercial fertilizer, doesn&#39;t begin to maintain a healthy soil over decades of use. I remember back in the 1960s old farmers claiming they could not raise as many hogs on a acre of corn as they once had, even with hybrid varieties. In 1975 a professor of agronomy at University of Wisconsin told his class it was cheaper and more efficient to dump their dairy manure into a river and use commercial NPK fertilizer instead. That was the heart of the soil he wanted dumped in the river. The chairman of the agronomy department also had such antediluvian ideas, notably , &quot;We never should have banned DDT.&quot; It would be wrong as well to assume that any great progress has been made since those days, there hasn&#39;t been and won&#39;t be any as long as a few mega-corporations controls our entire agricultural system from top to bottom. We aren&#39;t breeding nutrition out of our food, we are draining the source of nutrition out of our soils. I&#39;m sorry Vertasium, I&#39;m a subscriber, but I&#39;m afraid you don&#39;t know enough about agriculture to be able to see past the glittering surface of things.

I really love this channel and I really appreciate the work of knowledge spreading that you people do. So I wanted to add my humble opinion (as a permaculture and natural agriculture learner) about the arguments that you used in this video. I think this is a very complex topic and this video was way too short and limited.  I don&#39;t want to make a scientific essay here about the topic, it&#39;s just a simplistic opinion comment based on the information, books, articles and experience that I accumulated on the study of Agriculture, in order to expand a bit the view about it. (Sorry for my English orthography and grammar mistakes :):<br><br><br>1. &quot;They&#39;re ensuring that soil gets enough fertilizers and nutrients&quot; That exactly one of the main problems about food production nowadays and that&#39;s why even big industry is going back to ecological and natural processes based&#39; fertilization. It&#39;s not the same that you put 20 grams of pure Nitrogen in the soil than letting agents of nature get 20 grams of nitrogen from the atmosphere, because in this natural way there is a huge number of parallel processes taking place and producing secondary products that goes to different metabolic ways all around the plant and inside the plant. This vision of agriculture was a big failure of glorifying the little knowledge of chemistry that we had one hundred years ago, that saw agriculture as &quot;making a soup&quot;, you just add those ingredients and then you have a beautiful vegetable soup. But nature doesn&#39;t work like that, and has been proven that this vision took our soil to decay dramatically, all the microfauna disappeared with it, plants are more vulnerable to plagues and natural elements (wind, water flows, etc), also the soil&#39;s capacity of holding water falls, etc etc etc . <br>In the &quot;Wicked Problems&quot; theory (Rittel &amp; Webber) expose that a big thing to keep in mind when we face nature problems is that any solution to a &quot;wicked problem&quot; will bring unexpected consequences, so we should stay in the &quot;heuristics of fear&quot; (If applying some new tech or knowledge can bring negative consequences better let keep going further in the study before applying it).<br><br><br><br>2. This could sound conspiracy, but unfortunately science is lot of times pollute by market and money interest. Agriculture and Cattle Raising are two of the biggest industries in this planet, and so they are very pollute by money interest, which blocks the advance of learning in the field. Is not like I&#39;m saying that there is a big powerfull head making horrible plans about what you can learn or not, my point of view is that this big head is more ignorant or trapped in the established system than evil, it&#39;s more that people fall into believing and maintaining the habits of humans that thought them how to do agriculture, because it&#39;s a hard thing to change the way of thinking and to accept that a lot of knowledge that you already learned is wrong. Also we fall in the &quot;lock in&quot; effect, so it&#39;s hard to change a system that is so implemented already. <br><br><br><br>3. That plants are big and look green and healthy don&#39;t necessary means that they&#39;re productive and healthy. Sometimes this actually comes because human fertilizers produce that the plant spends more energy on growing leafs than it needs, and so metabolism gets altered. Fukuoka demonstrated, with his natural agriculture system, that his plants of rice which had smaller leafs than big convencional agriculture producers&#39; rice plants, were, however, much more efficient in rice production, using absolutely no external products no tilling, no machinery, and relying on crops rotation, compost, etc... <br><br><br>4. About selective breeding, I&#39;m agree. Also with GMO there is the problem that we look to improve one side of the plant but we don&#39;t realize that this will change the other side. Is like when psychiatrist thought that to solve depression you just take off this part of the brain without realizing that you are probably affecting hundreds of other functions from the brain<br><br><br>5. Cattle Rising I would say is the biggest problem of food industry. Let say it more clear; Meat is a problem. I&#39;m not vegan and it&#39;s not a preferences discussion. It&#39;s obvious and proven that cattle rising (in the way we do it nowadays, due to the tremendous demand) is one of the biggest problems we have both for the environment and for humankind (if we can even separate those two).  <br><br>I don&#39;t want to make a scientific essay here, so as a resume; you take 10 thousand cows, put them in a little room, they don&#39;t develop right, they get weak, they don&#39;t develop their muscles and systems,  they get sick, you give them antibiotics, they produce metan, they feel fear and depression (which has been proven that they do feel it), viruses mutate (hello A-flu, Influenza, and probably Covid-19), and well in conclusion you have a very sad, poorly nutritious, medicated and polluting peace of meat that if you eat everyday will increase your chance to suffer various kinds of cancer and heart diseases. <br><br><br>6. Also there is a problem about fertilizers, plaguicides, fungicides, and the infinite list of products that farmers think they need for some strange reason that I still don&#39;t understand as a natural farmer learner. They not only destroys the ecosystem around, but also most of times contains substances that are not digestible both for human body and animal os plants bodies, and so they accumulate and produce various diseases. <br><br><br>7. About the CO2 factor, that&#39;s something I had no idea about, and I think it&#39;s really interesting. Just want point, plants need CO2 to develop but that doesn&#39;t mean that they are able to consume and infinite quantity of it as sometimes I heard.

In a nutshell, there is supposed to be a healthy living ecosystem in soil and its also supposed to have trace amounts of almost all elements in it. Over time plants absorb these trace minerals and then we eat them and absorb them. However, if we don&#39;t use proper soil maintenance techniques, and instead we use modern fertilizers, then for the most part we are only replacing the nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in the soil. These are essential ingredients for plant growth, and allow plants to grow big. However, over time, by never replacing the other minerals and elements in the soil, the soil becomes depleted. This is why we need mineral supplements and multivitamins today - because we no longer get them in our food. Thus, you have neglected a major factor in plant nutrition without even acknowledging it properly.     That said, genetic manipulation, artificial fertilizers and increased CO2 do all contribute to larger plants with lower nutrient concentrations, so thank you for pointing that out. However, do please inform people about the great importance of healthy topsoil. Its been a huge part of our history, as cultures who don&#39;t respect topsoil usually suffer the consequences.

So, all you have to do is make fertilizer with different grain size nutrients to increase uptake in an environment with more CO2 you could even adjust the sizes to get more nutrient-rich food from whatever plant grown.

Consider this: when bees are foraging for food, they&#39;re likely going to go to the best source of food first, thus cross-pollinating the plants the very same way we do when we want to selectively breed (except we do it with tiny paintbrushes, and they do it with their faces). They are, by the very nature of life which is to seek the best nutrients and thus chance of continual life, selectively breeding the very crops that they visit, and perhaps without even realising it.<br><br>Thus, though we can reasonably discount <i>human-enduced</i> selective breeding with regards to that weed, I don&#39;t think we should discount bee-induced selective breeding here... Rather than focusing on what&#39;s causing the vitamin deficiency, I think you should focus on where the vitamins are going... you know, matter cannot be created nor destroyed, we live in a world where the fittest survive longer and so forth... is it possible that the nutrients are ending up caught in other parts of the cycle of life that we compete with? For example, we won&#39;t touch the majority of mushroom species, yet they are highly competitive... is it possible that we&#39;re losing protein, for example, to the more poisonous species of fungi?<br><br>I see that Cody is into bees... perhaps he might have some input here... in any case, I can see proof of selection by the ants in my back yard; they&#39;re putting aphids on some plants and ignoring others... hmmmmmmmm...", "comment_date": "2018-08-25T11:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roberto Alves", "comment_text": "But the majority of the protein that we consume come from animals.

That\u2019s not at all what Red Delicious apples tasted like even 50 years ago. They used to taste good, but companies decided to breed for color, shape, and durability instead of flavor because that\u2019s what people bought. And this is continuing to happen. Farms need to breed for certain things to even be able to break even, and the cost of that is taste, and sometimes ripeness. That\u2019s why stuff you buy in a grocery store doesn\u2019t taste as good. It could tie into this too. There\u2019s no way to maintain a farm using old breeds that may have better nutritional value, and keep cost of food/cost of living low.
