One of these is a simple bracket - no moving parts - that has two rectangular magnets held apart so there is a very strong magnetic field between them. A non-ferrous (meaning it doesn&#39;t attract a magnet) plate or fin is bolted to each coaster car to pass between those magnets. They are placed so they never touch.<br><br>When the train moves quickly into the brake run, it creates those electrical eddy currents, resisting the movement of the train, and thus slowing it down. But it can&#39;t really stop the train completely, just slow it down a lot because these eddy currents&#39; strength is proportional to the speed. Too slow, and they can&#39;t create electricity or force. So they add one traditional friction brake to actually stop the train.<br><br>It gets a bit nuts when you think of the implications. One of the big coasters to use this technique is Millennium Force in Cedar Point. Once the train goes over the lift, there aren&#39;t any brakes until the end, and this is a 300 foot roller coaster. It goes fast. But the last brake run has a whole lot of these bracket and magnet combos to slow the train. The only thing that actually stops this train that a moment ago was going 60+ MPH? A single rubber wheel.<br><br>If you take it to the extreme, the cylindrical tower and ring style drop towers operate on the same principle. The magnets and fins swap places, so the magnets are on the ring that is dropped, and the fins are bolted to the tower. When the ring is dropped with all its passengers, there is nothing but a couple guide wheels attaching it to the tower, and it falls in very close to free fall. The only thing that slows this ring down from crashing into the ground from some 200 feet is a braking system that never even touches the ring (!!!). A few pistons at the bottom cushion the last bit of energy, and you are safe on the ground again. And don&#39;t worry about it failing.
