He invented the mercury thermometer, and his scale isn\u2019t as arbitrary as people make it out to be. It was never meant to be a 0-100 scale - this was at a time when decimal systems weren\u2019t used for most measurements, or even currency. He based his system around multiples of 12, which were used in many other measurement systems and which we still use to measure time and angles. So 0\u00b0 = the lowest temperature he could stably measure at the time, and 96\u00b0 = the body temperature of a healthy person (which we now know is closer to 98.6\u00b0). He observed the freezing point of water at 32\u00b0 using that system, and set the boiling point to be 180\u00b0 higher (another multiple of 12), then calibrated the whole thing so that all the degree marks lined up on those numbers. I believe he was the first to calibrate his system around the freezing and boiling points of water, even though he didn\u2019t build it around those numbers from the ground up. And finally, I\u2019m biased on this one as an American, but I also find that Fahrenheit is more useful for weather temperature, since the 0-100 range of F\u00b0 more closely corresponds to local air temperatures you are likely to encounter on earth, whereas with Celsius you\u2019re basically limited to the -20 to 50 range\u2026 which seems as arbitrary to me as 32 and 212 for water.", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T19:40:59Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "RoofTopKorean", "comment_text": "v saucy", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T17:13:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew van Leeuwen", "comment_text": "Uppsala is in games....my van was used there ....and now there is a famous guy from there ....hmmm think I have to visit", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T16:39:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tremon 36", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjht4oAByCI&amp;t=3m49s\">3:49</a> funny, in Spain we say &quot;grados cent\u00edgrados&quot; Up to this day \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T14:46:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wesley Baldwin", "comment_text": "Now do a video on F", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T13:56:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerome", "comment_text": "Hey Vsauce here", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T13:39:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jelly Fish143", "comment_text": "In my opinion, Fahrenheit is the better scale for measuring outside temperatures and stuff relating to how humans feel it and Celsius is better for measuring waters temperature", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T07:51:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don Chonealyo The O'NEAL", "comment_text": "F*** all that I like Fahrenheit I grew up knowing Fahrenheit when it&#39;s 32\u00b0 I feel Frozen when it&#39;s a hundred degrees I feel hot Gru Celsius centigrade and all the others even Kelvin okay kelvins good when you get into the thousands of degrees maybe", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T04:34:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris L", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve TRIED to get it in my head what celsius is, but when someone tells me it&#39;s 30 degree Celsius outside, my first reaction is to reach for a coat, NOT a t-shirt.
