I was driving a 2022 FORD with the self driving feature. It worked great, I was able to nearly fall asleep in the driver&#39;s seat because my task load was almost nil, all I had to do was gently rest a hand on the wheel. That&#39;s sarcasm btw, making it harder for a driver to stay awake is NOT a good thing.<br><br>However I got to a section of highway in northern Alberta where the road lines were about 50% worn off, still easy for me to see, but the car would occasionally lose them, so I was being prompted to take the wheel far more often, but it would sometimes do weird things before it realized it didn&#39;t know where it was. During a stretch of good road lines I passed a rest stop pull out on the outside of a curve. It drove past the entrance just fine and I was playing tourist looking at whatever was parked in the pull out. However, as I passed the exit from the pull out back onto the road the car decided that the shoulder was now the lane, at 100kmh the computer turned the car into the shoulder that turned into a ditch in 100 feet. The car let me turn back onto the road, but it required more than a little force, and the dash lit up red because the car was convinced that I was trying to drive into oncoming traffic. <br><br>Cool feature, but we&#39;re not there yet.

You quote statistics about deaths caused by driver error with the assumption that the tech would not ever make the same error. What is that based on? Even if self-driving vehicles are better, they are surely not 100% better, right? Also, is there an unexplored set of errors that human drivers avoid easily, but that will be common with self driving cars, once they are commonplace? I&#39;ve been using computers heavily since the 1980s and frankly, I&#39;m unimpressed with how clunky, buggy, and unreliable they remain even to this day. Granted, they are better than they were thirty years ago but trust my life to them with a task as complex as driving a car? No thank you. Why would I believe Ford could do it better than Microsoft? Even if these vehicles have a better safety record in experimental tests, my experience does not leave me sanguine about this technology.<br>You mention that planes on autopilot do better than planes with a pilot in control. But I am unaware that autopilots handle takeoff and landing. Am I misinformed? Remember when Capt. Sully had a bird strike and landed his plane in the Hudson River, and everyone got off safely? Can anyone seriously claim an autopilot would have handled that just as well? Would the algorithm NOT instead have calculated that the 150 lives onboard were less important than the thousands who might die if the plane hit downtown, and chose instead to fly into the ocean in an algorithmically-determined act of human sacrifice? Because, y&#39;know, that&#39;s what the programmers predetermined was the ethical thing to do. That&#39;s an extreme case, of course, and involves a passenger aircraft. With cars it would not be so dramatic as one big event; it would only be thousands of small cases until the algorithm was eventually fixed. But since when have the IT experts of the world had to fix a problem with their software glitching AFTER releasing it to the public? Ridiculous!<br>[BTW, why is it every time I see on of these things being road tested it&#39;s on a highway in sunny California with the traffic moving along nicely? Show me how it works on a one lane dirt road in a snowstorm in Montana when a logging truck is coming the other way. Then show me how it works when I&#39;m the driver in that situation and it&#39;s the logging truck that has no human operator.]<br><br>But you left out the real ethical questions, here.<br>1) If there are both human-driven cars and self-driving cars on the road, and there is an accident, the courts will certainly view the tech through the same rose colored glasses as technophiles and assume the human driver is at fault - unless the evidence is overwhelming to the contrary. It will become the default assumption. This means in practice that everyone will HAVE to get a self-driving car as soon as they become common, no matter how much they may like and enjoy driving themselves.<br>2) If I&#39;m in a self-driving car and it hits and kills a kid, who is liable? It&#39;s my car, after all. I SHOULD have psychically seen the peril in the situation and taken over, right? I probably had to sign something to that effect when I bought the thing; any failure is actually my responsibility as the owner of the car. So I&#39;m responsible for something I had no real control over. But of course I can CLAIM that the fault lies with the car. So who gets sued? The dealer? The manufacturer? The programmer? The question becomes: in the chain of people who could be culpable, who can least afford the best lawyers? Who can least afford to lay the groundwork for avoiding responsibility by influencing the governing legislation? Hmm. I think that would be me. Is it not predictable that everyone else would be passing the buck until it came back around to me? Self driving cars will absolutely make you responsible for something that is not in your control.<br>3) There will be pressure from the auto industry for everyone to go out and buy the new, patented, product to replace the stock of traditional cars on the road. Because of course, that will be profitable for them. GM went belly up and the government stepped in to underwrite them; will this pressure from the auto industry NOT lead to rent seeking? Will there NOT be corruption that expresses itself in laws to encourage and require self-driving cars (and absolve manufacturers of responsibility for problems), whatever their hiccups might actually be?<br>4) Most worryingly: Once everyone has self-driving cars could, say, China create a system in which if a person&#39;s social credit score is not high enough their car shuts down? Could the U.S. remotely shut down the cars of everyone who hasn&#39;t paid their auto registration fee? How about their taxes? How about people who post &quot;misinformation&quot; online? What about people on the terrorist no-fly list - should they not be on a no-drive list as well? The ability to algorithmically control the mobility of some undesirable subset of the populace is just a shade problematic, is it not? If the government identifies a dissident, oh, excuse me, I meant to say a criminal, would it be possible to have their car drive them to the police station? Not in the U.S., of course - our government is fully committed to avoiding Orwellian behavior and would never do such a thing, obviously. That&#39;s just crazy talk.

Not to say that you&#39;re wrong, I agree completely with the overall point. Autonomous cars WILL save many lives and we should have them.<br><br>The thing I think you&#39;re missing, or ignoring maybe, is that by pushing driving decisions onto a program, the responsibility for those decisions falls onto the program and not the driver. It&#39;s easy to gloss that over and say &quot;no, the driver is still responsible&quot; but then it&#39;s not really autonomous, is it? If it doesn&#39;t work when no one&#39;s inside, I mean. So you have to program this stuff in. Not directly, of course. There won&#39;t be a line of code that directly chooses who lives and who dies in an accident, that&#39;s a silly diversion. But a strategy and approach to accident conditions must be programmed in, that much is obvious. It will be complicated and in many ways emergent behavior from many different sensors and systems, rather than being &quot;hard coded&quot;. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not part of the program.<br><br>I think getting &quot;on average&quot; safer cars on the road is a greater imperative than fine-tuning autonomous car driving strategy in accident conditions.

My view here is that an individual should be incentivized to get a self-driving car as soon as possible, and with that in mind the self-driving car should prioritize the life of its owner/passengers. This means that any individual is better off with one than without even if no one else has one, and then when everyone has a self-driving car everyone else benefits even more. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but even each individual part is good for each individual. By contrast, if the car is designed to weigh the driver&#39;s life against the life of outsiders, while perhaps the overall benefits for everyone having a self-driving car is greater, it creates a prisoner&#39;s dilemma type scenario where for any individual, they may be better off or at least feel better off relying on their own judgement knowing that they&#39;re never going to sacrifice themself for the greater good.

Maybe it&#39;s not so exciting and romantic that you can tell your children about later, but isn&#39;t it better to think about what could go wrong? I prefer to be more bored and take my time making decisions rather than just storming away. The development of self-driving cars is already fast enough - before 2007 we didn&#39;t even have smartphones (in the latest definition) and 12 years later we&#39;re talking about self-driving cars. Just a little more than a decade! In addition to moral and political guidelines, technological problems must also be mastered. All this takes time. \r<br>\r<br>Incidentally, the introduction of a general speed limit is once again being discussed here in Germany. At first glance, this only seems logical, because if all the other countries do it that way, it must be good, right? Not necessarily. In fact, Germany achieves similarly &quot;good&quot; death rates on its transport network as the comparable Spain, which is known to have a speed limit. In Germany, the motorway is one of the safest roads because there is no oncoming traffic or intersections. Of course accidents - when they happen - are always terrible and very exciting in the media, but the figures speak for themselves: despite everything they are very rare and above 100 km/h it doesn&#39;t really matter how fast you drive. An accident at these speeds almost always leads to death. The individual driving skills, the car&#39;s technology and assistant system are much more important than just the speed. There are still two other frequently quoted theses: avoidance of traffic jams and environmental protection. Well, traffic jams are not caused just by high speeds, but by irregularities and high traffic volumes. Both can be controlled much better by dynamic speed limits and possibly diversions than by a general speed limit. In fact, about 1/3 of all motorway kilometres are already limited - for various reasons. Let&#39;s get down to environmental protection: once we have electric cars and/or those with fuel cells on the roads and these are powered by renewable energy, the issue of environmental protection has come to an end. There are simply no more emissions. Then it doesn&#39;t matter how fast you drive and therefore have to recharge. The problem of environmental protection becomes at most one of individual time. In addition, even today a general speed limit would only save a fraction of the emissions from combustion engines. There are now far worse environmental pollutants than road traffic. It&#39;s like the problem of the noise generated by a submarine so it doesn&#39;t get discovered.

The message to the public is basically what you hear in this video - the technology has real potential to save lives (and, not mentioned, to lower emissions of transportation by decreasing traffic). Those benefits are real, and while it&#39;s certainly a benefit for businesses pursuing the technology, it&#39;s not the main reason. Obviously the main reason is profit, whatever, that&#39;s the motivation behind any business venture. The problem is that most of the profit comes from data collected on the passengers of the autonomous vehicle - data on where people are going and when, most broadly, and this information can then be sold to whomever - retailers, advertisers, marketers, product planners, financial analysts, government agencies, anyone willing to pay for it, and who can then use that information to build profiles about you.

There is going to be an accident involving an autonomous vehicle, and even though it wasn&#39;t necessarily the AI&#39;s fault that the accident happened, and in fact it did choose the least amount of damage or casualties possible, the media will horde it up in the title to say &quot;AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE CRASHES INTO CAR, SEVERAL INJURED&quot; or something of the like. Although it may be safer to drive in autonomous cars rather than human ones, there will be other humans driving on the road as the transition occurs, which would make scandalous media claims possible, and in fact might even completely shutdown autonomous driving. To make it a safe enough system so that this doesn&#39;t happen, is like in airplanes where the more tedius tasks up to the operator, e.g. lift off and landing, and let the ai take over the rest of the drive/flight where it is easier to control. A partial AI transition is crucial, although to the consumer it may seem insignificant, it probably is more worth it than having the blind media just go straight to blaming the generalized &quot;AI&quot; of the vehicle.

But may I remind you we rely on computer systems for literally everything. Like even the flight system to organize which flights take place at which times. And even things like dishwashers, or microwave ovens. So it&#39;s nothing new to rely on computers, and not to mention, people are way too easily distracted, while computers can&#39;t get distracted. They take in data from the components and process it, then choose a result based on how we programmed them. So they are way safer than humans. However! The only problem is, they have to track road lines, and they can&#39;t really see far ahead like humans can, and can&#39;t recognize things as well as us. But that is only a problem because the roads are not made for self driving cars. For example, if every car was autonomous, they could all communicate through a data system and know where virtually any car around them is. Not to mention the roads could be made to have some sort of emitter or something the vehicle can track, so it doesn&#39;t even need road lines to track. So driving in weather wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Also the street lights would not be necessary, and instead could be linked to an autonomous system so everything is synchronized. And if for any reason something did go wrong. The vehicles within the area would be notified, letting you know of an accident ahead, and give you alternate routes. Not to mention if the whole system was connected, the cars would not need such a physical tracking system if all the routes of other cars around yours could be identified so your car knows not to pull into a lane at a certain moment another car is. So currently self driving cars are a mess. But if the whole system was redone (a lot of time and money).

Vault 7 release from Wikileaks already indicates that the CIA may have the ability to take control of cars remotely; imagine if Putin had that power and could take control of the cars driving around Congressmen or their families. Or someone connected to ISIS. Or just some random 400lb jerk in his basement out for shiate and giggles. Or a debt collection agency can simply drive a car from your lot to their lot.<br><br>What is the risk to losing that essential skill - driving - to our society, which is so dependent on goods and services moving around with precise timing? If there is a hiccup in the system (and EVERY computer system has hiccups) that causes trucks to be unable to drive, there is a real possibility that people may die due to lack of critical needs (perishable medicines for the most part) at critical times. The longer society is used to vehicles that drive themselves, the more people there will be who are unable to drive a vehicle &quot;manually&quot; (in this case meaning driving as we know it today, not driving a manual transmission vehicle). As an example of essential skills being lost, most people in the West today could not reliably grow their own food if their lives literally depended on it - the majority of people in the West would starve to death if they were forced to suddenly grow their own food.

Aeroplanes for example have a fairly simple hierarchy in how they operate: They will attempt in order (this may be slightly wrong but should right in main) to not stall, not crash into the ground, not run into other airplanes, and not make sudden movements which may damage the payload. That is a far more simple model than the hundreds of potential risks and threats that face a car, and with the more complex environment, comes more complex moral dilemmas as well. Planes are programmed on the theory that the safest option is to keep it under control and in the sky, and the scale above reflects that. In a car, keeping it on the road is not necessarily safer than off the road depending on the circumstances. A car programmed poorly could result in the death of more people than a human driver would have. And then who is responsible? Is it the manufacturer? the user? the owner? The safety authority who certified it.

Then almost as if god had intervened every single car, whether it&#39;s in that lane or the lanes around them, will apply their brakes and adjust accordingly, the autonomous truck will get the information that something is wrong and adjust to pull over whilst someone comes along to clean up the mess and nobody gets hurt.

What we, as a society, typically value most is freedom, or autonomy. <br><br>Here&#39;s an example: Imagine we had the option to convert our society into a &quot;police state&quot; - universal 6pm curfew, police and government officials could, at their discretion, search anyone&#39;s home/person, detain suspicious people, and incarcerate individuals deemed &quot;high-risk&quot;. Such a society would be undeniably &quot;safer&quot; than any society that currently exists. Violent crime would be nearly wiped out. Yet why does that scenario seem so terrifying? Why would the overwhelming majority of people vote against such a system, even though it maximizes the number of lives &quot;saved&quot;?<br><br>Because it incontrovertibly denies our right to freedom. People would rather be free than safe, and we can look to history example after example of this. Now, I&#39;m not unilaterally against the implementation of self-driving cars. Overall I think they would be a great asset to society. But I don&#39;t think the ethical and moral implications can just be swept under the rug. And it&#39;s going to be a VERY difficult issue to reconcile. The biggest issue, I think, is going to be the &quot;safety of the driver vs safety of everyone else&quot; issue. How does a machine make a decision between prioritizing, say, the life of its one occupant versus the lives of a family of four in the vehicle in the next lane? The car can avoid an obstacle (such as a a mattress) that fell into the lane ahead, which could potentially result in severe injury/death to its one occupant, or it can veer into the next lane, avoiding the obstacle but colliding with the family of four, maybe running them off the road. <br><br>To anyone who says it should just maximize the number of lives, think back to my earlier example.

They almost certainly will be eventually, but elevators and planes are false equivalents for precisely the reason already mentioned in the video: Cars have far more degrees of freedom than an elevator, and the opposite problem (far more obstacles) for planes. It&#39;s safer to cruise on autopilot; humans take over for takeoff and landing. Long before autonomous cars are safer than humans in all situations, they&#39;ll be safer on highways.<br><br>2) I see a lot of people complaining that there&#39;s no moral dilemma to program, but you&#39;re not quite right. The car does not care about morals, but the programmer does and has to give the cars priorities that reflect his or her morals. That is, if someone jumps out in front of a car, does it slam on the brakes and <i>maybe</i> injure the person less, swerve into the woods and almost certainly kill its &quot;driver,&quot; or swerve into oncoming traffic and <i>possibly</i> cause even more deaths, but also possibly merely cause more injuries with no fatalities? This may be an edge case, but with millions of cars on the road, it happens every day. Moreover, there&#39;s the matter of financial responsibility: Can someone injured by a self-driving car (whether passenger, pedestrian, or another driver) sue the company that made it because the choice it made to reduce injury <i>caused</i> that particular person&#39;s injury? The companies designing the cars have to worry about that before they market them too aggressively.<br><br>3) You know what&#39;s <i>way</i> more dangerous than stupid distractable monkeys operating thousand-pound vehicles capable of reaching speeds of over eighty mph? Stupid distractable monkeys operating those vehicles while <i>some</i> of the cars around them are computer-operated. Computers do precisely what they&#39;re told to, and humans don&#39;t. Ironically, that makes computers unpredictable to the average human, because the computer will make the <i>right</i> decision most of the time, but the human might not, which means the human can&#39;t predict what the computer will do. The situation&#39;s even worse in reverse: The stupidity humans sometimes exhibit is beyond a computer&#39;s capability to calculate. This combination is likely to result in a <i>rise</i> in traffic accidents (especially in cities, possibly accompanied by a slight decrease in accidents on highways) during the roll-out phase of self-driving cars. Which leads us to the last part:<br><br>4) That roll-out phase is going to take <b><i>decades</i></b>. People aren&#39;t going to want to give up their control. People aren&#39;t going to want to shell out the extra cash. And that&#39;s just the few people who can afford new cars. I don&#39;t personally know anyone who has ever bought a new car from a dealer. In the US, at least, middle class means buying &quot;certified pre-owned&quot; cars from a dealer, while anyone below that buys cheap lemons from the classifieds (or Craigslist, nowadays) or from skeezy &quot;buy-here-pay-here&quot; used car lots. My car is fourteen years old. I know people who drive cars that are more than twenty years old. If the dealers started selling nothing but self-driving cars tomorrow, they&#39;d be maybe half the cars on the road in ten years. I grant you, that&#39;s partly the point of this video---It&#39;s gonna take a while, so we need to start ASAP---but, given point 3, that means it&#39;s gonna get a lot less safe for a decade before it gets better. Worse, car companies that don&#39;t have good self-driving controls yet (anything cheap, pretty much) will use that fact to make it look like self-driving cars are the problem in their advertising, which will make lawmakers and insurance companies even more leery, which will force manufacturers to perfect the software even more before putting it in cars for sale.", "comment_date": "2017-01-26T00:39:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Callum", "comment_text": "Hey Vsauce I have a question that&#39;s bothering me and I need help finding an answer.

Autonomous cars are great and I totally want them to exist of course, but if it&#39;s just to fix &quot;driver error&quot;, I think they&#39;re being administered for the wrong purpose, as let&#39;s face it, they&#39;re just the next line of &quot;adult toys&quot; for us humans to play with. Safety shouldn&#39;t be the issue, death by driving isn&#39;t a very big issue either, the issue to me is simply whether we want them on whole... do people on avg. want to give up driving themselves or stay in control?

People - even if statistically safer in an aeroplane - feel safer when driving their own car.

Imagine I&#39;m told that my car is about to crash and either I can drive it, or I could have say an expert driver do it (with whom I&#39;m statistically safer). The instinct to take my chances and be accountable for my own outcome is far higher than it should be. <br>2. The motorcycle/ SUV thought experiment... That is a legitimate moral question. It isn&#39;t somehow negated by the fact that the stats tell us fewer overall fatalities will happen.<br>3. If I programme the car and it kills the motorcyclist am I accountable? If it&#39;s a question of AI calculating different probabilities etc. then you have the problem of there essentially being no accountability at all. That causes nightmares both morally and legally. If the car chooses to crash into me and causes damages- who do I sue?! The car company? That seems unlikely. The driver who didn&#39;t choose to do it? Seems unfair.

The left lane is occupied by a car with a family, the middle lane has you the driver, and the right lane has a single person on a motorcycle. In front of you is a truck that suddenly has part of its cargo come loose and is flying  towards you. The self driving car has one of 3 possible actions, it can swerve to the right colliding with the motorcyclist, killing him in the process but saving the driver. Option two is that the car swerves to the left colliding with the car with the family, possibly injuring or killing them but again saving the driver or the car can stay where it is, possibly injuring or killing the driver. What should the self driving car do&quot;<br><br>This is one version of the &quot;Self Driving Car Moral Issue&quot; there are many but this is the one that i hear a lot.<br><br>The solution to this problem is easy. Have self driving cars. The idea is that the car containing you the driver can swerve either way without any danger due to the fact that at the same time the car swerves the vehicles on the left and right side can come to an emergency stop to allow the car to swerve.

Just how bold are the programmers of these cars going to be? Yeah, the idea of autonomous cars sounds great, but i really can&#39;t see them being a success whilst they share our city streets with us mere human drivers, where we all drive bumper to bumper during rush hour, only stopping to let people out of side roads if we really have no other choice. If the city was full of nothing but highly disciplined autonomous vehicles, then yes, they would work well, but until then, i think we are just inviting trouble for ourselves by letting self driving cars onto the roads of our towns and cities. Let alone the dilemmas that are mentioned here in the video. Again, if all vehicles on our roads were self driving, they would be fine, they would all play along together nicely.<br>Another point, one shown in this video, the person behind the wheel is still totally responsible for that vehicle, so he or she should still be giving the road ahead the same amount of attention as if they were actually driving the vehicle. For a start i just don&#39;t think a lot of people will do that all of the time, things will distract them, and the tech built into the car will simply give them a false sense of security, and probably lead them into doing things they would not have done if they were in full control of the car. And even if they were giving the road 100% attention, now they have not only got to try and second guess what other road users are going to do, they are also thinking about what their own car is going to do. And if your car for whatever reason does not do something it should be doing, by the time you have realised it that fact you are probably well past the point where you would have taken action for yourself in the first place. <br>Like with so much else these days, it really is tech just for the sake of it.

I have no problem with self driven cars, they will come in, but there are a few problems and you just don&#39;t mention them in the video. If you had just brought up one possible issue then I&#39;d have accepted this video as objective, but it is pure propaganda. The reason that they can&#39;t be can&#39;t be rushed in is because, although as you say they could save live there is no evidence that a computer would make the right decision. So it might not save lives and it might actually introduce more accidents where a human would react and make the better choice. The example you give is a fairly simple one, a choice of the lesser of two evils. What if there is a third choice to your problem, or even a fourth, say breaking and stopping the car or either partially going right or left, then breaking? The other problem I have is that self driving cars would work fine on freeways or interstates where the car can communicate with other self driven cars or even the road if it is a smart motorway, but not so well in urban areas where there are more random things going on that the self driven car wouldn&#39;t know about. If all cars on the road were self driven then this might not be a problem, but there will be a long time until this is the case and self driven cars might not react like human drivers and so human drivers might cause more accidents as they won&#39;t be able to anticipate what the self driven car is going to do in a certain situation. Add to this the fact that first generation models of many technologies are very primitive and encounter issues that weren&#39;t anticipated, that us as humans take for granted and have inbuilt into us over a million years of evolution. There is also the possibility of self driven cars being hacked by someone with bad intentions, they would need to be incredibly secure and not connected to any internet or 4G signal that would allow the control of the car from a remote location. Also if it is proved safe on big interstates, motorways, autobahns call them what you will, but less so in urban environments will there be some self sensing of switching back to a driver controlled car? There are so many implications and it isn&#39;t just a have self driving cars or not. Lastly what happens if the onboard computer just crashes suddenly without any warning going at high speed, maybe about to overtake another vehicle and the person in the drivers seat is doing something else and not paying attention to the road or what is going on. This could cause many accidents, and not just minor bumps but major incidents with lots of casualties. So I think we are right to be cautious with a lot of testing in as many different locations with many different scenarios before self driving cars are allowed on a large scale or we might just be walking into a nightmare on the roads.", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T23:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reconnaissance Man", "comment_text": "Veritasium you probably won&#39;t see this but I&#39;m doing a school-sanctioned interscholastic project on this topic, and I was wondering what you thought about the part at the end?", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T23:14:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dennis nguyen", "comment_text": "I have this urge to go out and buy a BMW vehicle and other BMW related products...", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T23:13:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "XenoContact", "comment_text": "NO no don&#39;t !

Disappointing.  <br><br>Two things:<br>1. No matter who is driving (person or computer), insurance companies need to charge more when there is an accident, so I see the powerless driver whose car caused an accident getting stuck with the bill. OR everyone who has a driverless car gets charged the same increased price to compensate for the occasional accidents.  By the way, when someone without an autonomous car does something that causes the auto-car to have an accident, who is at fault?  I can see a ton of instances where the human driver did something, then continued on their way not even knowing that an accident happened and that something might have been perfectly reasonable.  The auto-car gets the blame there, sometimes correctly, sometimes not.  There WILL be a long time where auto-cars will share the roads with human drivers.<br><br>2. It seems to me that we have a few driver assists already that will drastically reduce accidents, such as stopping the car when it gets too close to a car ahead that has stopped (or slowing the car so it keeps enough distance automatically), lane drift warnings, etc.  As for going completely autonomous, it seems we could make them required for anyone who has been stopped for driving impaired even once (a serious expense so don&#39;t be a jerk and drive drunk or high). Also, I think we should shy away from putting people in categories such as &quot;too old to drive&quot;.  The driver assistance tech would probably solve most of that problem.  Another one could be to limit the speed of the car to avoid reckless driving.  So I am not saying limit the speed to the speed-limit,\u00a0just avoid crazy speeds like more than 20 over the limit, for example.  The car assist tech would need to account for where that speed might be necessary for a short sprint to avoid an accident.<br><br>So in the end, a greatly reduced accident rate, maybe even to the level of where the rate would be if all cars were autonomous, and where accidents do happen, the human is still responsible. I know this doesn&#39;t account for people watching the road even less because they think their car will prevent them from back over a kid or ramming into someone who is stopped.  But surely we could come up with something where the car &quot;punishes&quot; drivers who don&#39;t pay attention and rewards those who do. :)", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:53:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Sehon", "comment_text": "Anyone else notice that Veritasium has an atomic mass of 42.0", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:53:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roland Kontson", "comment_text": "The &quot;responsibility&quot; aspect takes time as well.", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:52:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subie Mad", "comment_text": "no self driving cars shouldn&#39;t be made a thing faster, it will take away the &quot;magic&quot; of driving and working on cars", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:52:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Amuedo", "comment_text": "You just called potentially thousands of lives a &quot;Tiny Distraction&quot; .", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:51:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rex DiPietro", "comment_text": "I wouldn&#39;t want someone to be able to tap in and control My own car though.", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:51:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffery Rowan", "comment_text": "The main illustration isn&#39;t accurate because an autonomous car would have kept a safe following distance behind the truck and would have time to stop.", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:51:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thewingedturtle", "comment_text": "Autonomous cars should also be communicating with each other so that we are never put in a position where the car has to make that choice.", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T21:49:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Life's great question", "comment_text": "Seeing this video brightened my day.

Right now, price is not a big issue since autonomous cars have to build trust with the general public, hence they have to be much better than strictly necessary. Any accident right now is &quot;very expensive&quot;. That won&#39;t stay this way.<br><br>Eventually, they&#39;ll try to divert every penny they can into their pockets. Security (or lack thereof) is currently the weakest link. How about thousands of autonomous cars that can be remote controlled because of a bug in the software? Imagine a sign change in the weighting functions to optimize for &quot;less distance to others is better&quot; or &quot;go faster as the street becomes more slippery&quot;. Or how about &quot;turn sharp left 3 minutes after the human took back control&quot;.<br><br>On one hand, this software must be open for updates (otherwise, security holes will never be fixed). On the other hand, if manufacturers don&#39;t design a safe + security update process, attackers might make your life extra exciting for a time. And lastly, there will be those people who think &quot;this is my car! I own it! Everything (including the software it runs) is under my control&quot;.

Absolving people of personal responsibility, elitism, the Wall-E-ification of the population and loss of freedom. First: Instead of blaming the people who&#39;s behavior\u00a0causes accidents we are taking away their ability to cause the accidents, that way people can continue to be idiots\u00a0while causing less harm to\u00a0others, because having a population of idiots is much more profitable than a population of intelligent people who understand cause and effect. Second: These are not &quot;cars&quot; they are private luxury pods with a robot chauffer that cost an asinine amount of money. A mechanically maintained rusty old Yugo can get you from point A to point B just as good as a Tesla 99.99% of the time. Any differences between the vehicles, including safety features, are just luxuries, luxuries that cost multiple tens of thousands of dollars just because we have been sold the idea that they are supposed to cost that much. Third: All this talk about safety and in the beginning of the video it features &quot;technology&quot; that\u00a0REQUIRES you to take your eyes off of the road! My Sunday cruiser is a 1971 Chevy, and I can fully operate the &quot;infotainment&quot; system and the climate controls flawlessly all without taking my eyes off the road because they have REAL buttons, knobs and levers that you can touch and feel to know where your fingers are before you push, twist or pull them. But we have to have screens because without them we can&#39;t have the aps that gather all our personal information and we wouldn&#39;t be able to have supposedly personalized advertising constantly\u00a0shoved in front of our faces. And Fourth: Autonomous cars work best in traffic if there aren&#39;t any non autonomous vehicles. Almost everyone knows someone who would willingly pull out in front of traffic to save a second if they were reasonably sure that the oncoming cars would automatically brake for them. So a few\u00a0people behaving badly in old cars could easily justify outlawing all old cars for the overwhelming majority of people who obey\u00a0the law. So my feelings are that if you don&#39;t want to drive, take the damn bus.

Look, this is a science channel, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t engage with philosophically and ethically fraught issues. The problem is, your video pretends to do so at the outset, but then never actually does...that&#39;s a problem.

If I had paid for the next model up, it would have come with automated braking.  Cars are also available that warn if leaving a lane without signaling. <br><br>How much of the &#39;human error&#39; isn&#39;t so much error as the amount of attention it requires to drive a car? If the car is better able to notify us of dangers, we can still use our own abilities to make those moral decisions.  It would be interesting to see the accident statistics for just cars with these technologies. <br><br>My wife and I discussed self driving cars on a recent road trip from Florida to Ohio. We came to the conclusion that someone still has to pay attention, but now they are more likely to be even more distracted. Plus, I happen to enjoy driving. I love making spur-of-the-moment decisions because I saw something on a billboard. On a recent trip to Nashville, I stopped at the George Dickel distillery, something I doubt I would have done if the car had been driving and I had my nose buried in a book or app on my phone. I like making decisions based on traffic input, or taking a different route because I hate driving through Atlanta and prefer going this way. <br><br>And really, how can someone reading a book respond to a warning from a car?
