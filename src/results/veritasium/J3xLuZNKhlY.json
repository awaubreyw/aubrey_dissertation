The fluid is slow in rebounding, so when particles follow from the same source the interference of the previous particle is still existing allowing for the behavior of particles to behave like waves and particles at the same time.   <br><br>Now of course this is just an initial idea based on personal intuition that I had, and I&#39;ve since had more questions that I think would lead to a better hypothesis.  My point though was that it&#39;s really cool to hear about the gluon energy fields existing in empty space and behaving the way they do.  One of the questions/ideas I had was about finding a way to apply fluid-mechanics to the idea of space-fluid and determining the viscosity of space if there was any even though it seems that mass and energy flow mostly(I say mostly because of the influence of gravity) uninhibited through the vacuum of space.  In fact just now I had a thought about why this idea might be completely wrong, but since I don&#39;t know for sure either way I&#39;ll continue to ask questions and see where it leads.

What I mean to say is, the electrostatic field and the magnetic field we are used to knowing about is only a signal (disturbance) transmitting through the EM field, whereas the gravitational field is caused by a gradient in the density of that EM field much as a gluon field.<br><br>Perhaps, if you take the average density of the gluon field around matter (such as a planet), you will find the average density to be higher, thus, slowing gluon-waves (if such exists). Likewise the average density of the EM field around matter (such as a planet) is also higher, thus, slowing EM-waves and time, resulting in a distortion of our perception of what we call space-time.<br><br>In summary, gravity has two forms:<br>(A) the &quot;gravity A&quot; field which is a short-distance gravitational field caused by a gradient in the (time domain) average density of the gluon field. This form of gravity overcomes the electromagnetic force and holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus of a stable atom, and it is what we know as the nuclear strong force.<br>(B) the &quot;gravity B&quot; field which is the long-distance gravitational field caused by a gradient in the (time domain) average density of the EM frield.

And more to the point, the video claims that quarks and gluons are found on the peaks of the wildly varying quantum fluctuations shown here.  This is basically what is happening with Couder&#39;s walking droplets -- they bounce from one wave front to another -- and do so because the weight of the droplets and gravitational energy interact to move the droplets forward through space at just the right speed for the droplet to land on the same part of the next wave forward in the direction of movement of the droplet.

I think new empty space is created by gravity&#39;s field - or the magnetic field. What you are seeing is the empty new space. To be clear there are 2 types of empty space. There is empty space, and there is 2nd empty space which you see here. This is created in the universe any time something moves. Say the earth moves, The space left behind by the earth is new 2nd empty space. This is how the universe is expanding everywhere. This new empty space cannot pass through old empty space. These are at the far end of the spectrum way lower than long waves.  I see it as empty vacuum, Then you have 2nd empty space , These are the vacuum fluxtuations - Basically this is what happend when gravity field of an object leaves an empty space behind. Then we have light vibrating as it moves through gravity waves. from long wave all the way to GAMMA waves, Eventually you have a black hole that absorbs light. Strong gravity eventually changes the shape of light, inverts the cone and releases the light energy as a GAMMA ray burst. The long wave is the front of the light here is it not visible. GAMMA is rear. This what black hole do, similar to a leave shedding leaves, The black hold sheds energy to allow new energy in. With increased black holes we see increased gravity, thus increased empty space, resulting an a faster expansion of the universe. <br>The core here for you to now see is that light has a shape, a layered frequency which can change, There are many types of light shape. Plants green light. Light is ripples, so does vacuum space. There are different frequencies of vacuum space, light, noise. Its all frquency interaction. Light hit gravity, Gravity ripples which affects lights interfere pattern. Here gravity hits vacuum, The vacuum ripples,  Gravity goes where it is going but does ripple. This is what makes gravity bounce like a wave. Gravity waves.  New spectrum is empty space, Gravity, Gamma, visible light, radio wave, long wave, black hole space time, inverted light is released from black hole. This is the long wave signals in the universe. <br>*Inverted light is - Long wave front facing as top layer with GAMMA as rear layer. Normal light has GAMMA is top and long wave to the rear.
