Antivenom is given, as said, as a last resort, when things do go bad...<br>But they do live in cold climates...

Ok, there was a great amount of pain involved, but nothing else. Also there&#39;s that weird story out there of a man who has repeatedly been bitten by different redbacks when using public toilets. He, too, is still alive (or so the story goes).<br>I&#39;m happy to live in an area where no dangerous venomous creatures exist. But for all I&#39;ve gathered, knowing how to act once you&#39;ve &quot;received&quot; the venom makes a whole lot of difference as to how it turns out. Next absolutely weird thing I&#39;ve heard is that bites of young snakes tend to be more dangerous than the bites of the old ones because the old ones have learned to &quot;calculate&quot; the dose of venom for a defensive bite and don&#39;t intend to kill you while the young ones only bite without any control of the venom. That&#39;s so amazing and there&#39;s so much to learn and marvel at.

The first  idea is that the evolutionary pressures of adapting to surviving the colder climates, and the seasonal hibernation or hatching reset of many species didn&#39;t&#39; leave much energy resources or need for many highly venomous creatures. It seems there are plenty of poisonous creatures in colder environments, but that is more of a passive projection that protects a species not an individual. <br>Nor is it as helpful in feeding because of the basic hunting strategies employed in a colder environment.  <br>I surmise that venom turns out to be not as useful in colder areas.

Everything migrated to where it lives; and the migration model fits the evidence. Things didn&#39;t magically evolve and they weren&#39;t restricted from travel in the past just because the land bridges aren&#39;t currently above sea level. we can still dive into the ocean and see the land bridges, we can detect them by satellite and we&#39;ve mapped them thoroughly.

I dare you to stand up for your own intellect and not stand on ludicrous assumptions that were forced on us in an pre-information age of racism, conquest, enslavement, &amp; factory-farming humans. We need to step out of that and follow the evidence WITHOUT stooping to bow to disproved assumptions for the bulk of a video about a migration pattern. [Also, if you wonder why some snakes are successfully breeding out their venomousness, ask yourself the critical question whether written history got it right; that they (along with all other living things) were tampered with, &amp; corrupted; and if natural breeding processes could be responsible for some snakes leaving so called &quot;adaptation&quot;s behind as the healthier breeding pairs are actually those that are simply keeping the fittest, instead of relying on x-men-style extra powers].

Because most venomous animals mainly hunt coldblooded prey. In warm regions the blood of coldblooded animals is... well err... <i>less cold</i> which makes the chemical reactions venom is based on take place faster and with greater effect... Meaning prey dies faster and the hunter can avoid their prey escaping or even wounding them more often.<br>2. Tropical rainforests and coral reefs occur only in warm climates and house a huge chunk of the worlds species in general (venomous or not). <br>3. Venom usually evolves to effectively hunt only a handful of very specific prey species; venom is often a specialist survival strategy.

So i always felt semi safe, but we do have ticks carrying both lime disease(~30%of the ticks are carriers) and tick born encephalitis(i think this one was either 6 or 0.6%) and some ticks carry both, so it isn&#39;t like we are safe which is what i used to think as a kid. Another very interesting thing is that the malaria virus has been found in some parts of the country but we can be happy that we do not have the right mosquitoes that can carry it unless climate gets worse. otherwise you&#39;d get malaria in the north as well.

I have a theory for this, and I believe it would have to do with success rate versus opportunity. A bite doesn&#39;t always mean a kill, since the prey still has a chance to get away (it will still probably die, but may be inaccessible). Venomous species usually only have one shot since they have to take time to build the venom up again, giving them a smaller window of opportunity versus something like a constrictor that can just go hunting again. Prey that escapes or having to defend itself takes away from that window of opportunity, giving other species a chance to hunt when the venomous snake cannot. Using their one shot to defend itself also leaves the venomous snake more vulnerable to predation since it cannot defend itself. In short, venomous species can have a higher success rate, but their window of opportunity is much smaller.<br><br><br>I guess this means danger noodles are more complicated than we thought.

There&#39;s more biodiversity in &quot;Tropical&quot; places, hence there&#39;s more variety of everything, even venomous animals.

Because it&#39;s the most stable climate with temps that only fluctuate ~ 14C (25F) in the entire year, vs temps that fluctuate  ~45C (80F) outside the tropics. That increased biodiversity compounds the evolutionary effect by increasing competitiveness among species forcing them to evolve more aggressive traits. Invasive Fire ants for example are from the tropics &amp; they are highly evolved outcompeting all ants outside the tropics in climates they can tolerate.  Some animals have venom because they&#39;re fragile. Snakes that eat insects dont need venom. Burrow hunting snakes that eat rodents, cant constrict in the burrow, so they may use venom to kill the rodent as quickly as possible before it deals a deadly wound to the snake. A jelly fish must kill a fish instantly because if the fish flinches inside the jellyfish it can kill it.

For places like Hawaii it\u2019s likely the ecosystem wasn\u2019t diverse enough to warrant the evolution of venom. Example would be something along the lines of birds, a snake really doesn\u2019t need venom to kill a bird, so any snake that evolved venom wouldn\u2019t have a particular advantage and most likely not pass down its genes. In fact I can see a disadvantage since to create venom requires energy. It\u2019s all about the calories.<br><br>   To continue what my first sentence, the people to ask would be the chemists and physicists. Looking at a compound\u2019s formulation, it\u2019s obviously and endothermic reaction ( it takes heat and energy to create). If you\u2019re a wolf in the Arctic for example and trying to survive, it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense to have a continual process stealing precious calories when eventually evolution produces something requiring less, say, sharp teeth...<br><br>   As for the biologists saying there is no pattern, that is complete nonsense. In North America for example there is a specific line where nothing north of the line produces venom ( at a macro level, not aware of microscopic organisms and such). This line is slightly north of Washington D.C. , and they have it nailed down pretty well and exceptions are extremely rare, all essentially strays but never more than 100km or so north. For those curious, the animal is a rattlesnake, which isn\u2019t particularly venomous comparative to others of the same species found in California or Texas for example.<br><br>   As for Australia, going off the word of the biologists and how the snake was introduced makes sense, it also doesn\u2019t break the trend for poison being in warmer places.

My conclusion is that in a hot place like Australia, moving around is detrimental because it wastes energy and means you&#39;re in direct sunlight. That&#39;s why there aren&#39;t a lot of big animals. In a lot of the places where these venomous creatures live, most of their prey are lizards and other cold blooded animals. This means that if you&#39;re a snake, or spider, or whatever, then you not only want to exert as little energy as possible yourself, you also have to make sure that when prey comes by you don&#39;t fail to kill it. This makes powerful venom a huge advantage. If you&#39;re venomous but your venom isn&#39;t very strong, then the creature you inject will get further before gong down. Furthermore in hot climates heart rate is lower, so the venom will move around the body slower, and needs to be stronger as a result. I think the heat means that running after prey is not good for a predator, and it&#39;s not good for the prey either, so both have evolved away from that.

Saliva could also increase the snakes chances for dehydration as well. So venom might be only as expensive to make as saliva, but snakes produce no saliva, there are of course mucosa in the snakes mouth that need moisture, and that is just plain moisture most likely from the tissue itself. Saliva and venom, venom stays in glands until it is needed, saliva wouldn&#39;t work nor would it be of any benefit for the snake, I&#39;m afraid.", "comment_date": "2019-05-14T21:01:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oculus Angelicus", "comment_text": "Being Canadian AND Australian, you should know that Alberta Has venomous Rattlesnakes.

Defining &quot;venomous&quot; in relation to humans means ignoring that relationship, for no real reason; as you mentioned with the funnel-web, lots of &quot;deadly-to-human&quot; venoms seem to have that characteristic entirely by accident, as the creatures possessing said venom don&#39;t count primates as major prey or predators.

Rattlers&#39; much stouter bodies (compared to the sleeker forms of non-venomous N.A, species) allows for greater heat retention during the cold of desert nights, and together with an energy-saving ambush strategy, and fast-acting venom to reduce  energy costs of subduing dinner, all combine to meet the challenge of extreme temperature fluctuations. These conditions almost preclude non-venomous species in these regions, but this v to non-v ratio quickly reverses  moving further north and east. I&#39;m guessing this is because greater vegetative  cover reduces day to night temp. swings thus removing those severe activity  restrictions for prey and predator alike.

But, maybe it&#39;s not as simple and obvious as I think it is, so I&#39;m going to put my explanation here before I continue watching, then I&#39;ll go on to see if I&#39;m a smarty pants or dip sht :). Here goes: warmer climates produce more life, period. They are much more conducive overall to life itself - for instance, leave a piece of meat out in 40 degree F weather, then try 80 degree F - you&#39;ll quickly see how much easier it is for organisms to reproduce (by how quickly the meat rots, which is simply decomposition by way of micro organisms) and therefore, more vegetation = more food = larger populations that thrive = more opportunity for evolution = greater number of species = more fine tuned skills needed for survival = greater number of species that have very specialized ways of competing for food and succeeding. Now let&#39;s see if it&#39;s that simple... On to watch the rest.<br><br>Ok, so after watching, it seems maybe the original hypothesis that there are more venomous species in warm climates may not even be true. Though, I do think that my hypothesis still stands - there is certainly a greater diversity of life in warmer climates and I think it is for all the reasons I stated. I think the venomous question is probably the same...

Certain birds in North America have evolved shorter wing spans allowing more agile flight and in turn allowing them to take advantage of highway overpasses for nesting. The birds with longer wing spans kept getting hit by cars. This has been confirmed by examining the bodies of birds killed in this manner near these nesting sites. The birds with shorter wingspans are at this point nearly absent from the impacted population despite representing the majority of the birds at these sites. This data set goes back several decades and actually traces the development of the shorter wingspan over time. Rattlesnakes in North America are beginning to not use their rattles. Why? Because we humans like to eliminate things that can kill us or display aggression towards us. While many snakes go unseen by simply waiting for us to walk on by these rattlesnakes would basically announce their presence every time we were near. The rattle is still there. They just don&#39;t use it nearly as often as they once did. Along the same lines it is not hard to imagine our ancestors doing this over thousands of years. Something proves to be a threat and we hunt it down - and anything that looks like it. As such venom and aggression became a liability anywhere you find humans and we are everywhere.

Because he has missed the illogic in his focus he is trying to answer the wrong question.<br><br>In fact, most or nearly all spider species are venomous, but not nearly enough to endanger a human.  Now venom must be biologically expensive.  So, the question arises naturally, why should a spider or a snake ever have powerful enough venom to kill a person?  An animal as large as a person is far too large to be prey, so the only possible reason would be defensive.  But even lethal venoms are rarely powerful enough to kill a large animal instantaneously and so would not offer much protection, for instance, against being stepped on by a horse.  In fact, in most species whose venom is powerful enough to kill a person, the venom capacity developed to overcome a much smaller preferred target prey animal, such as a rodent in the case of a snake.  But then the rodent develops some resistance to the snake&#39;s venom and an evolutionary arms race ensues as the snake&#39;s venom becomes progressively more potent to overcome the heightened resistance of the mouse.  It is just an unfortunate, for us,  and coincidental byproduct of this process that the snake&#39;s venom is strong enough kill a person or a horse.  <br><br>So, then why would there be more such powerfully venomous animals in the hot countries than in the temperate regions?  Well, the predator-prey arms race of venom and resistance takes time to evolve.  The ecosystems in the temperate region, however, were mostly wiped out in the last ice age and so are only about 15,000 years old, too short time in terms of evolution for such complexity to evolve.  The ecosystems of the hot countries are much older and considerably more complex including, but not only, with respect to these predator-prey relationships.  <br><br>The explanation of the original immigration of venomous snakes to Australia twenty million years ago, does not explain the prevalence of venom-capacity in Australian snake species today.  We know that venom-production has disappeared over time for some species of snakes consistent with our expectation of high-cost.  If venom capacity offered little survival advantage for the invasive species in Australia there would have been enough time for it to evolve away during twenty million years, but it hasn&#39;t.", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T11:12:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Terence Tam", "comment_text": "the moment he said he was from australia i started hearing the accent", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T04:30:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred Ferd", "comment_text": "Oh, I am highly allergic to horse serium - it would kill me!!!!", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T04:45:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred Ferd", "comment_text": "Oh, I am highly allergic to horse serium - it would kill me!!!!", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T04:45:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred Ferd", "comment_text": "Just as a side thought; if you&#39;re going to consider Australia, you should factor in Wallace&#39;s Line.

Regardless of ecto or endothermal properties, if the snake is an average size of a few feet, it&#39;s going to have more luck getting food when it is smaller. With a few exceptions in terms of size, fat regardless, being things such as elephants in the warmer climates, you&#39;re more than likely going to find more things such as small prairie mice such as a titmouse (Not saying you&#39;re going to find mice infestations, but smaller animals in general) which are easier for the snake to catch and consume. So, the populations in climates that are not in these warmer zones with easier to catch and consume prey are going to die out, leaving the ones in warmer climates to prosper. Land area comes into play just because of the room that these populations have to sustain themselves in relation to their prey.

Random chance mutations are not planned strategies to solve a problem. That statement is far more sympathetic to Intelligent Design. <br><br>Random mutations are exactly that -- random. They are not a volitional act to improve the species&#39; chances of natural selection. While it is possible that a random mutation might be an improvement to previous organisms, we know from science that more often than not, mutations have a negative impact on organisms. In fact, it is just as likely that mutations would have produced a second head or a new enzyme capable of digesting alternative foods.

If you&#39;re producing venom, either you have to be immune to it (which is tricky, especially if you have one of the really useful kinds of venom that targets, say, the most common / efficient / evolutionarily advantageous system for distributing blood, which would mean you have to settle for a less efficient system), or you have to contain it somehow (like in a venom sac), and if you go with that then you have to be careful not to jab yourself with the delivery mechanism.  And since these are animals, who have to carry their venom and its delivery mechanism around with them 24/7 (unlike a human, who could put the poisoned dagger in a box when they&#39;re not using it), that can be a significant risk.  Want to get around that risk?  You&#39;ll need specialized structures, like fang covers that only retract when your teeth are out of range of the rest of your mouth or that only release your fangs when your lower jaw is way out of the way, and that means you&#39;re more complex and take more energy to produce offspring.  Failing that, you&#39;ll need specialized behavioural programming, which can be even more complex (and more finicky and less reliable).  So even if making venom doesn&#39;t impose all that much of an energy cost on the individual snake compared to just making saliva, having the genetic coding to produce venom imposes a cost on the species that may or may not be worth it.  This is also probably why you get successful non-venomous snakes evolving from venomous ones -- like you said, venomous snakes have venom so they can be less active, and only operate in short bursts of activity that reliably kill their prey outright.  So a non-venomous snake has to be more physically active than a venomous one -- and since they&#39;re not using the energy to build each offspring with venom equipment, they can put that energy into muscles and bones instead.  And an increased capacity for physical activity can offer some advantages over being venomous (though obviously not an absolute / universal advantage, or else venomous snakes would never have evolved to begin with).  So if some combination of external factors shifts the balance away from venom in some significant way -- maybe the kind of large, nutritious prey that venomous snakes are used to feeding on become scarce, and they start needing to go hunting more often for smaller prey -- it makes sense that some lineage that traded super-deadly venom for increased physical abilities would find itself at an advantage.", "comment_date": "2016-11-29T21:26:28Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Lawa9919", "comment_text": "why... why did you put a giant image of a spider onto my screen???

Neurotoxin, if not treated fast enough, it will paralyze the diaphragm which is responsible to aid the lungs to breathe, its more complex than that, but that is enough in a nutshell. Hemotoxin, basically turns your blood into jello, causing necrosis around the area. Leading to amputations and death by cardiac arrest. There are very effective ways to quickly kill the snakes pray. Once, the venom is injected  into its pray, the snake will wait a short while until it can digest whatever it caught.

You will notice that many venomous creatures are cold blooded, I.E. they can not control their temperature range. Warm blooded creatures CAN control their temperature range, which as you might guess, is warm. You will also notice that venomous creatures can not control the temperature of their target. The target is either going to match the temperature of its surroundings (which can vary wildly), or it&#39;s going to have a warm interior with a known temperature.<br><br>Now let&#39;s do a simple thought experiment. We have four small, cold blooded creatures. Two of them live in a hot climate, and two live in a cold climate. Of each of these pairs one of them has an enzyme based venom that is fully active at hot temperature, while the other&#39;s venom is active at low temperature. Which creature is the most dangerous?<br><br>- The hot climate creature with the cold venom is screwed. It can&#39;t do anything because the local temperature never reaches a point where the venom can work. Darwin wins.<br><br>- The cold climate creature with the hot venom is in a lot of trouble. It can only envenom warm blooded creatures, which tend to be larger or faster or riskier targets. Some warm blooded creatures will even hibernate, causing trouble in winter. The odds are stacked against this creature.<br><br>- The cold climate creature with cold venom is okay. It can tackle other cold blooded targets in its class, but it can not do much to endanger a warm target because the venom turns inert as it warms up. There is more benefit to specializing its venom against other cold blooded targets, rather than developing an ENTIRELY NEW venom just to deal with something warm.<br><br>- The hot climate creature with the hot venom is WINNING. Its venom is fully active against cold blooded creatures, who must suffer the same high temperatures as their environment. It can also apply the SAME venom to warm blooded animals, who will keep the venom active in their blood stream. Every new evolution of venom has the potential to improve its diet, dramatically increasing its access to food.<br><br>So there you have it.

Perhaps the less food a snake comes across over time, and the greater the temperature is in their environment, the more crucial it becomes for the snake to kill something. Maybe it also has to do with how they kill their prey as well. Pythons simply constrict and perhaps bite = no venom while the smaller less strong snakes rely on venom. If their prey are tougher to deal with, then the snake&#39;s genes may register this information from previous failed encounters, and this may in return buff its venom strength to compensate. I strongly believe it has to do with an underlying balance between all things both good and bad [or positive and negative].<br><br>Being in warm climate as opposed to cold climate = good; therefore, the counterbalance to said &quot;good&quot; = more venomous creatures = bad. In the cold, you have to worry more about surviving frostbite, starvation, etc. = bad; therefore, the counterbalance to said &quot;bad&quot; = less venomous creatures.

Environmental factors are one of the biggest driving forces behind evolution.\u00a0<br><br>Snakes and spiders for one, have the same kind of long history, where the earliest species of such animals have been in a situation, which has helped/forced them to create venom.<br><br>Snakes are cold-blooded (as already explained) and they need warmth to get their body temperature to a right degree. This is easier in climates where there is more sun, and as such, more heat. There are European vipers here in Finland too for example, but once winter and the cold arrives, they go into dark places inside crevices for example, and go into a state of brumation, which is a state similar to hibernation, but the two aren&#39;t the same thing.<br><br>Now with spiders on the other hand there is little or no tolerance to cold. Most of the spiders die during the winter. Some bigger spiders like tarantulas, who have longer life-spans, need some kind of shelter (like snakes) like under a tree bark or inside a house where they can do their hibernation (again, not really hibernation, but of something of their own design).<br><br>On a much broader sense there is a rule which dictates that warmer climates can support more species per an area of specified size, compared to the same sized area of a colder climate. This has probably more to do with plants at this point more than anything else. Heat and rainfall dictate growing seasons on plants, and where there is more abundance of such things, the growing season is longer and more species of plants can thrive (it can&#39;t be too hot or humid of course). So plants need these things, animals eat plants, and other animals eat the other animals. Everybody is happy, and the plentiful supply of food attracts more animals.<br><br>Evolution then does what it does. When so many animals and plants live among each other, some species are forced to compensate, as to survive the evolutionary arm&#39;s race. Venom can be one of these arms, but more like it has always been there for these species, and now it&#39;s just a thing that makes them better in some respect than other animals.<br><br>When you start to get further and further away from the cold, the climate obviously gets warmer. There are deserts in such parts of the world, obviously. But in deserts again it&#39;s more about arachnids like scorpions which are the things venomous there. Snakes too. And these group of animals, again, have already been doing this venom business so long, and have evolved such a way of doing this so early, that now it is just a case of the evolution itself. And these groups of animals like heat (up to a point) and so it is obvious again that there are such venomous animals there. If there is a spot in ecosystem for an animal to fill, it will be filled. These animals have done so. And they happen to be venomous.<br><br>As for the other cases of venom and poison, it is again environmental. The Greenland shark is poisonous, not because of it&#39;s history as a warm climate species, but because it&#39;s environment or it&#39;s food supply has made it so.<br><br>Australia has \u00a0been cut off from the rest of the world, as have many islands. At some point they have been part of some bigger landmass, and most probably in the case of Australia, there has been some parts of it covered in rainforest, so the abundance of species (including the venomous ones) had already been there when it separated. Australia has then had time to create species of it&#39;s own, and by chance it just happens to be abundance of venomous animals.\u00a0<br><br>And of course, most of them are spiders and snakes, which history had already been dictated for quite some time. They had had a long time developing it, and were a long past a point of return in their style of hunting, which necessitated venom in the first place. If food sources and environment should change enough, so should the snakes and spiders. It&#39;s evolution.<br><br>The same environmental rules and evolution applies to underwater. Coral reefs are the underwater counterparts of jungles. They offer abundant source of food.<br><br>Same goes for the coastal waters. Coasts are governed by seasons, by tides, and support different kinds of animals better than say deep ocean.<br><br>Where do these venomous jellyfish live? On the coast, on the reefs. Obviously they again have some kind of environmental requirement that forces them to that certain part of the ocean. They developed venom because that is how they hunt and protect themselves. Have you seen these box jellyfishes or the Irukandji? Compared to some deep water cousins of there&#39;s, they are like glass.<br><br>And as said in the video, truth be told, how much can there be venomous or poisonous animals anyway in the north, if there aren&#39;t that big variety of species to begin with? In relation to the limits of diversity, the amount should be tiny.<br><br>Evolution has made these animals what they are, and environment and their food force them to be at a certain kind of places, at least for the time being.

I wrote some time travel stories in junior high school that used a machine of my own invention to travel backwards in time, and I have continued to study this fascinating concept as the years have gone by.<br><br>We all travel in time. During the last year, I&#39;ve moved forward one year and so have you. Another way to say that is that we travel in time at the rate of 1 hour per hour.<br><br>But the question is, can we travel in time faster or slower than &quot;1 hour per hour&quot;? Or can we actually travel backward in time, going back, say 2 hours per hour, or 10 or 100 years per hour?<br><br>It is mind-boggling to think about time travel. What if you went back in time and prevented your father and mother from meeting? You would prevent yourself from ever having been born! But then if you hadn&#39;t been born, you could not have gone back in time to prevent them from meeting.<br><br>Albert Einstein<br>The great 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren&#39;t about what we experience in everyday life, but scientists have confirmed them. This theory says that space and time are really aspects of the same thing\u2014space-time. There&#39;s a speed limit of 300,000 kilometers per second (or 186,000 miles per second) for anything that travels through space-time, and light always travels the speed limit through empty space.<br><br>Special Relativity also says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, especially when your speed relative to other objects is close to the speed of light. Time goes slower for you than for the people you left behind. You won&#39;t notice this effect until you return to those stationary people.<br><br>Say you were 15 years old when you left Earth in a spacecraft traveling at about 99.5% of the speed of light (which is much faster than we can achieve now), and celebrated only five birthdays during your space voyage. When you get home at the age of 20, you would find that all your classmates were 65 years old, retired, and enjoying their grandchildren! Because time passed more slowly for you, you will have experienced only five years of life, while your classmates will have experienced a full 50 years.<br><br>Time traveler<br><br>So, if your journey began in 2003, it would have taken you only 5 years to travel to the year 2053, whereas it would have taken all of your friends 50 years. In a sense, this means you have been time traveling. This is a way of going to the future at a rate faster than 1 hour per hour.<br><br>Time travel of a sort also occurs for objects in gravitational fields. Einstein had another remarkable theory called General Relativity, which predicts that time passes more slowly for objects in gravitational fields (like here on Earth) than for objects far from such fields. So there are all kinds of space and time distortions near black holes, where the gravity can be very intense.<br><br>In the past few years, some scientists have used those distortions in space-time to think of possible ways time machines could work. Some like the idea of &quot;worm holes,&quot; which may be shortcuts through space-time. This and other ideas are wonderfully interesting, but we don&#39;t know at this point whether they are possible for real objects. Still the ideas are based on good, solid science. In all time travel theories allowed by real science, there is no way a traveler can go back in time to before the time machine was built.<br><br>I am confident time travel into the future is possible, but we would need to develop some very advanced technology to do it. We could travel 10,000 years into the future and age only 1 year during that journey. However, such a trip would consume an extraordinary amount of energy. Time travel to the past is more difficult. We do not understand the science as well.<br><br>Actually, scientists and engineers who plan and operate some space missions must account for the time distortions that occur because of both General and Special Relativity. These effects are far too small to matter in most human terms or even over a human lifetime. However, very tiny fractions of a second do matter for the precise work necessary to fly spacecraft throughout the solar system.<br><br>Find out how one NASA mission is doing some very clever space-time experiments to test Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity using the International Space Station.<br><br>So my question is....do you like chicken nuggets?", "comment_date": "2014-04-14T16:49:10Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "down lo", "comment_text": "I guess we need to be looking into why cold blooded organisms are venomous!

To us the venom would be seen as an advantage because we could inject an animal from a distance and then track it til it died. Much like how we use different types of tools to accomplish a gool.
