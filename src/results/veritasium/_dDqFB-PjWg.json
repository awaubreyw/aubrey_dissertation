As a consequence: the planet wouldn&#39;t be able to accommodate us, as there would be no room left with all the early life still crawling around. Death, unfortunately, is the only way a species is able to adapt to new circumstances, which in turn is the only way the species is able to survive long term. Or to put it succinctly: short term death is necessary for long term survival.<br> <br>That said, nothing suggests it&#39;s impossible for a species to gain immortality and yet survive through the aeons. It would only require the species to become advanced enough to compensate for what it now lacks from nature. We already do that to an extent: we have airplanes so we can fly, even though nature never provided for wings in our body plan.

We&#39;ve maxed out the first and the second is fading due to over-use of antibiotics leading to highly resistant bacteria. All other factors are negligible. Furthermore, as people become even more indolent and even more obese, life expectancy in the West is actually - for the first time in history outside of war zones - decreasing due to a huge increase in lifestyle-associated diseases. There is thus no reason for optimism regarding any further meaningful extension of the human lifespan.

Yes, immortality of <b>cells</b> is dependent on telomeres not shortening. But there is a <b>huge</b> difference between individual cells and organisms, where cells must grow, proliferate and die in a <b>harmonious</b> fashion. Unlimited cellular replication leads to cancer. Mice, for instance, have much longer telomeres than humana t 50 kilo bases compared to only 7-10 for adult humans, and yet mice live, on average, only 2 years compared to humans who live 40 X longer. In fact, a kew charactersitic of long-lived species are short telomeres. Bowhead whales, for instead, the longest-lived mammals, with a life expectancy of at least 210 years and potentially as much as 270 years, have an average telomere length of 9 kilobases. Hydras are &quot;immortal&quot; because their telomeres never shorten. But, the problem is, when a hydra divides it essentiually &quot;dies&quot; as it becomes two individuals. Or cells also &quot;die&quot; when they divide, as they become two new cells as the parent cell ceases to exist. So there is an issue of semantics here. It depends a lot on your defition of the word &quot;immortality&quot;. In complex organisms such as humans, cellular immortality is a <b>bad</b> thing because our cells need to divide in precise cycles, and they must self-destroy when(via apoptosis or necrosis) when they have DNA damage that is too severe to be repaired. Otherwise, cancer.<br><br>This video is a dramatic ovrsimplification. In long-lived species such as humans and bowhead whales, telomeres are kept short for cancer-prevention reasons, and the body makes up for that with a alower rate of cellular division, more efficient repair of DNA, and higher levels of antioxidants like catalase and superoxide dismutase to protect the short telomeres from corrosion, as well as stem cell reserves to replace the cells that get killed by out immune systems when their telomeres get too short. <br><br>If your telomerase were activated and you experienced no telomere shortening, it would be disastrous. Immortality? No, you would become a huge ball of tumors and die a horrible death. .", "comment_date": "2021-10-10T00:51:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Marzarella", "comment_text": "My nana lived to 102 years old.

So we haven&#39;t really raised how long people live for, only that more will live for longer. This actually fits with that this episode is talking about. So the question is how long can people really live? Maybe 60-70-80 is the low end of the maximum we can live. Maybe unless we fix this problem of cells only being able to replicate a finite number we might not leave much longer than we do. Because we already lived quite long before people had already live until they were 90 so now we have people living until they are 120...

I just want to ask you one thing:<br>I liked your video about breaking the speed of light and got a little obsessed about it, a friend told me a theoretical idea and we tried to find the answer on the internet but failed. \u00bfIf here on Earth we are under the laws of gravity staying at a force of 9.807 m/s^2, if we change the mass and diameter of the planet to rise that gravity force to say half the speed of light/m^2 and we put an object (with mass) 3 seconds light away, what would happen after 3 seconds? Would it became light?<br>I&#39;ve seen answers but only if the object is the light, not if it had mass.<br>Also, about this video n_n, I only have a comment, apparently the only cell that can be divided by itself indefinitely is the zygote, but not alone; if we think about it it replicates until it completes a full body (huge amount of cells) and one of that cells would be a germ cell (maybe and egg) and with proper conditions (and a little help from another germ cell) that first zygote has been replicated until it is anothe one, and so the cicle goes on, sure its genetic information can change but still if it weren&#39;t for that zygote, countless of cells and organisms wouldn&#39;t exist so that zygote can (under the right conditions) replicate itself forever, so maybe in a future we could use germ cells to regenerate organs or systems because they can divide into fresh new cells.

Following the feasible way and replenishing the cells every now n then, our body tries its best to keep the replication procedure as error proof as it could be (DNA replication machinery has so many safeguard mechanisms which do in fact ensure efficiency of 1 in a billion chance of error but the fact that it has to make 3 billion of such operations every time a cell divides renders it far from being perfect). So what happens when these errors keep accumulating in the cell&#39;s DNA sequence generation after generation? If one is lucky the errors might simply kill those cells or render them unable to divide or perform their functions etc. Or it might lead to cancer when these cells escape the mechanisms that keeps them from dividing. So one can say that if you live long enough you are bound to have cancer.

Death at very young age is a more convincing cause for that average, given what we know about life in the wild w/o medicine and technology. <br><br>2: The idea that we developed this mechanism to fight cancer is peculiar. We stop reproducing WAY before we reach an age when cancer and telomere shortening become an issue, so there would be little advantage to give up immortality to fight cancer. It makes more sense from an evolutionary standpoint to consider this just another &quot;error&quot; that evolution has no intrest in correcting because when old age becomes a problem, the individual either already reproduced or doesn&#39;t deserve to because is not fit.

That is to say, out of all people who survived to their 15th birthday, the average age at which they died was 54. It is true, however, that people live longer now than they did then, it&#39;s just slightly less impressive to go from 54 to 80 than from 33 to 80.<br><br>People who are interested in aging, how it works and how we might be able to slow it down would probably enjoy reading David Gems.
