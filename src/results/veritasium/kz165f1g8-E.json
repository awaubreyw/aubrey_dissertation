In some other videos were the subject is a &quot;simple&quot; thing (actually not so simple) like a lake topped with plastic balls, a vehicule that navigates faster than the wind, a basket ball travelling in an odd way, and you provide a complete explanation of these oddities. You found a lot of fascinating subjects like this, the one about Penrose tiles for instance is astonishing.<br><br>And then there are videos like this. We&#39;re no longer in the realm of truth and facts here, despite the name of the channel. These videos (sponsored or not) glorify some megalomaniac wet dreams from the Silicon Valley, there are mot about promises of things that may or may not happen and work, not about facts. The way you film shiny metal, clean factories (where no one seems to actually be working?), with slow travellings and clean lighting, it gives the impression that we&#39;re seeing a commercial film about a showroom in a car exhibition. Which is actually the case when we see the part about... Tesla!? Why on earth mention Tesla here, while we&#39;re talking rockets, not cars? And why with the clean, commercial-looking images that look like they came out of Tesla&#39;s official press kit? And what about the video where you interviewed that man who predicted that tech would make us immortal? Is that &quot;truth&quot; ?<br><br>I understand that you need to make ends meet, and that sponsoring may involve making compromises. But if these compromise go too far, you may lose the respect or trust of some part of your viewers. I personnally enjoy your content about basket balls and tiles, that&#39;s were you could show your specific talents and knowledge; this... looks like commercial communication that I could see on a start up&#39;s website.", "comment_date": "2022-09-10T06:16:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheUsualSquad", "comment_text": "Imagine russia becomes the biggest country on mars", "comment_date": "2022-09-09T15:29:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SlavaXaoc", "comment_text": "\u0418 \u0433\u0434\u0435? \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0451\u043b...  \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0432\u044b?", "comment_date": "2022-09-09T07:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LYRO FPV", "comment_text": "Investing into Relativity Space anyone?", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T12:22:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fo\u00ed\u03b2os Apo\u03bb\u03bbon", "comment_text": "Man&#39;s dodged that question like neo", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T00:32:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "teetee tee", "comment_text": "Finally StarCraft is catching on.", "comment_date": "2022-09-06T07:17:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mbox314", "comment_text": "The walls on that look wobley AF.

Unto us a Son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. \u201c<br>Who is Christ? Who is Jesus?<br>Born of a virgin, Mary.<br>Matthew Chapter 1 verse 20: \u201d behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him (Joseph), in a dream and said, \u201cJoseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that (Christ) which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.<br>Jesus, the Christ, is God\u2019s word made into flesh.<br>1 John chapter 5 verse 7: \u201d For there are three that bear a record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.\u201d<br>John chapter 1 verse 1: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot;<br>John chapter 1 verse 14:  &quot; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\u201d<br>John chapter 1 verse 10:  &quot;He was in the world, and the world\u00a0 knew Him not.\u201d<br>Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12:  &quot;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\u201d<br>How beautiful and awesome is God\u2019s Word, who is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, magnificent in all His glory, is He.\u00a0 Amen!<br>John\u2019s Vision Of Christ Seated On His Throne In Heaven:<br>Revelation chapter 4 verse 2 to 3:  &quot;Immediately, I (John), was in the Spirit, and behold a throne sat in Heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.\u201d<br><br>Why did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us?<br>Christ (God\u2019s Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam\u2019s flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh (Jesus Christ\u2019s flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death\u00a0 shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell.<br>Christ, who is God\u2019s Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions. Christ died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,\u00a0 Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power (God). Through Christ\u2019s sacrifice we gain Salvation through God\u2019s abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus.<br>John chapter 3 verse 16: &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 8: &quot;But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d<br><br>Christ came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam.<br>Death in Adam, Life In Christ:<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 19: &quot;For as by one man\u2019s disobedience (Adam), many were made sinners, so also by one Man\u2019s (Jesus) obedience, many will be made righteous.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 18:  &quot;Therefore, as through one man\u2019s (Adam\u2019s) offense judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man\u2019s (Christ\u2019s) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 17:  &quot;For if by the one man\u2019s offense (Adam\u2019s offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One (Jesus Christ).&quot;<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 12:  &quot;Therefore, just as through one man (Adam) sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.\u201d<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 21: <br>\u201cSo that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d<br><br>Through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it more abundantly. Yes, Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation. The Salvation of His shed blood, and resurrection. Adam\u2019s flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation.<br>1 Corinthians 15 : 21-22, \u201cFor since by man(Adam) came death, by Man(Christ), also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all shall be made alive.\u201d<br>Christ\u2019s sacrifice, the crucifixion\u00a0of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, resurrection, eternal life and salvation.<br><br>Christ is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, warring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all.<br>Amen! Halleluyah!<br>Revelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: \u201d And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. \u201c<br>Now do you see friends, why Christ Jesus is so Important for our Salvation? Yes.<br>Now, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus? Yes.<br>Christ is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men (us humans).<br>God loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God\u2019s Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us. Christ is God\u2019s living Word.<br>Will you accept Christ and be saved? Your eternity depends on it. What happens after death, is what&#39;s  important. Where will you spend eternity?<br>Romans chapter 6 verse 23: \u201d\u00a0 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d<br>John Chapter 3 verse 16: \u201d For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<br>Salvation is free!<br>Christ already paid the price, all you have to do is receive salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach.<br><br>So who is Christ?<br>He is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is The Rock not cut out by human hands. He is the Root of David. He is Salvation. He is the way, the truth, and life. He is the promise fulfilled to Abraham.<br>Amen!   I love you Lord!<br><br>God created the heavens and the earth with His spoken Word. Did you know that Jesus is that Word, through which all things were created? Yes.<br>John chapter 14 verse 6: &quot;Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d<br>Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16:<br>&quot;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.\u201d<br>John chapter 1 verse 1 to 4:<br>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\u00a0God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.\u201d<br><br>I hope that you now know and understand Christ better, without any doubts, to the glory of God.\u00a0Amen!<br>Christ is for all who will receive Him.<br>This is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said we should pray. Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13:<br>\u201cOur Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.\u201d<br>Now that you understand who Christ is, share Christ with others. Christ is The Good News. What do we do with good news? We share it. Amen!<br><br>Repent of your sins. Sin no more! Be baptized in Jesus Name.<br>Submit to God.<br>Love God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Keep God\u2019s Commandments.<br>Love one another.<br>Forgive one another.<br>It is written, \u201cresist the devil, submit to God, and the devil will flee from you.\u201d<br>Hate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.<br><br>Rejoice Our King Is Scheduled To Return<br><br>Revelation 19 verse 13-16, &quot; He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called\u00a0The Word of God, and the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.

Can ye possibly bear witness that besides Allah there is another Allah?&quot; Say: &quot;Nay! I cannot bear witness!&quot; Say: &quot;But in truth He is the one Allah, and I truly am innocent of (your blasphemy of) joining others with Him.&quot;<br>20. Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe.<br>21. Who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or rejecteth His signs? But verily the wrong-doers never shall prosper.<br>22. One day shall We gather them all together: We shall say to those who ascribed partners (to Us): &quot;Where are the partners whom ye (invented and) talked about?&quot;<br>23. There will then be (left) no subterfuge for them but to say: &quot;By Allah our Lord, we were not those who joined gods with Allah.&quot;<br>24. Behold! how they lie against their own souls! But the (lie) which they invented will leave them in the lurch.<br>25. Of them there are some who (pretend to) listen to thee; but We have thrown veils on their hearts, So they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; if they saw every one of the signs, not they will believe in them; in so much that when they come to thee, they (but) dispute with thee; the Unbelievers say: &quot;These are nothing but tales of the ancients.&quot;<br>26. Others they keep away from it, and themselves they keep away; but they only destroy their own souls, and they perceive it not.<br>27. If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say: &quot;Would that we were but sent back! Then would we not reject the signs of our Lord, but would be amongst those who believe!&quot;<br>28. Yea, in their own (eyes) will become manifest what before they concealed. But if they were returned, they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden, for they are indeed liars.<br>29. And they (sometimes) say: &quot;There is nothing except our life on this earth, and never shall we be raised up again.&quot;<br>30. If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say: &quot;Is not this the truth?&quot; They will say: &quot;Yea, by our Lord!&quot; He will say: &quot;Taste ye then the penalty, because ye rejected Faith.&quot;<br>31. Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah,- until on a sudden the hour is on them, and they say: &quot;Ah! woe unto us that we took no thought of it&quot;; for they bear their burdens on their backs, and evil indeed are the burdens that they bear?<br>32. What is the life of this world but play and amusement? But best is the home in the hereafter, for those who are righteous. Will ye not then understand?<br>33. We know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee: It is not thee they reject: it is the signs of Allah, which the wicked condemn.<br>34. Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs, until Our aid did reach them: there is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers.<br>35. If their spurning is hard on thy mind, yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign,- (what good?). If it were Allah&#39;s will, He could gather them together unto true guidance: so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance (and impatience)!<br>36. Those who listen (in truth), be sure, will accept: as to the dead, Allah will raise them up; then will they be turned unto Him.<br>37. They say: &quot;Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?&quot; Say: &quot;Allah hath certainly power to send down a sign: but most of them understand not.<br>38. There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end.<br>39. Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb,- in the midst of darkness profound: whom Allah willeth, He leaveth to wander: whom He willeth, He placeth on the way that is straight.<br>40. Say: &quot;Think ye to yourselves, if there come upon you the wrath of Allah, or the Hour (that ye dread), would ye then call upon other than Allah?- (reply) if ye are truthful!<br>41. &quot;Nay,- On Him would ye call, and if it be His will, He would remove (the distress) which occasioned your call upon Him, and ye would forget (the false gods) which ye join with Him!&quot;<br>42. Before thee We sent (messengers) to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they might learn humility.<br>43. When the suffering reached them from us, why then did they not learn humility? On the contrary their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them.<br>44. But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them the gates of all (good) things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts, on a sudden, We called them to account, when lo! they were plunged in despair!<br>45. Of the wrong-doers the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher of the worlds.<br>46. Say: &quot;Think ye, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you?&quot; See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); yet they turn aside.<br>47. Say: &quot;Think ye, if the punishment of Allah comes to you, whether suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed except those who do wrong?<br>48. We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend (their lives),- upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.<br>49. But those who reject our signs,- them shall punishment touch, for that they ceased not from transgressing.<br>50. Say: &quot;I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.&quot; Say: &quot;can the blind be held equal to the seeing?&quot; Will ye then consider not?<br>51. Give this warning to those in whose (hearts) is the fear that they will be brought (to judgment) before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor: that they may guard (against evil).<br>52. Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. In naught art thou accountable for them, and in naught are they accountable for thee, that thou shouldst turn them away, and thus be (one) of the unjust.<br>53. Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others, that they should say: &quot;Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us?&quot; Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful?<br>54. When those come to thee who believe in Our signs, Say: &quot;Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) mercy: verily, if any of you did evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amend (his conduct), lo! He is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>55. Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up.<br>56. Say: &quot;I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon.&quot; Say: &quot;I will not follow your wain desires: If I did, I would stray from the path, and be not of the company of those who receive guidance.&quot;<br>57. Say: &quot;For me, I (work) on a clear sign from my Lord, but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened, is not in my power. The command rests with none but Allah: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges.&quot;<br>58. Say: &quot;If what ye would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong.&quot;<br>59. With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered), but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read).<br>60. It is He who doth take your souls by night, and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed be fulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.<br>61. He is the irresistible, (watching) from above over His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. At length, when death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty.", "comment_date": "2022-07-23T04:34:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheRjjrjjr", "comment_text": "It seems to me that Elon Musk gets counted out of all this discussion but he really did originate many of the things being discussed in this video.

In this case the mechanical advantage is achieved by getting the electric motor that is spinning to be able to spin a quantity of separate discs that are connected to devices that generate electrical current to generate more current then the electric motor needs to spin. One of the ways to achieve this without violating the laws of thermo dynamics is to exploit magnetic field effects. To do this you place the magnets on the disc that the electric motor is spinning in a way that makes it so while the disc is spinning around the magnetic fields are slamming upwards onto the edge of the other discs forcing them to spin, thereby generating electric current. In this way, the magnetic fields will be forced to do work that the electric motor wont be doing. This is how it&#39;s possible to achieve an Over Unity Electric generator &amp; with this technology we can free ourselves from the use of gas.

The full implications of even a single sighting being genuinely real is almost to good to be true, it confirms everything I&#39;ve wished for my whole life, and many others. The reality we are in here and now isn&#39;t real in the way we think it is. It&#39;s real because we believe it&#39;s real and all there is, but there is a shocking bigger picture. Peoples heads might literally explode if they suddenly could comprehend what this bigger picture is, it is that shocking. I could never <del>fully</del> believe in an optimistic worldview like this with all the apparent suffering in nature - animal suffering, how could a loving &quot;god&quot; setup a world with that going on. I&#39;m just going to blatantly say it: I&#39;ve figured it out. This reality is the most elaborate prank of all time, setup to make us believe we are something we are not. &quot;mother nature&quot; is no different whatsoever than any human made technology, it is &quot;manmade&quot; technology in fact. No &quot;God&quot; exists that created the plants, animals, cell, human bodies even. Nope it&#39;s just mere technology INTENTIONALLY SETUP TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE BENEVOLENT OUTSIDE INTELLIGENCE DOESN&#39;T EXIST. That is all. everything we learn in science about evolution and our history of having evolved from animals, or religious fairy tales like the garden of Eden, are just cover stories to hide what is actually going on. There is no such thing as death, conscious death, we aren&#39;t bodies but have been forced into believing we are, we are in fact something FAR FAR more than mere bodies. Genuine consciousness is the only real value thing in all existence. It has been unfairly farmed through our suffering for the benefit of the power brokers ruling this world. It is allowed to happen like this, because it also serves as the ULTIMATE test of true character and true love. But it is just a game, a cosmic hoax, prank, with loving implications that reach beyond understanding. It&#39;s a riddle, a test. That is it. Please spread this message everywhere.

I&#39;m an aerospace engineer and looking at the surface of that rocket makes me cringe... hard. 3D printing is an alluring process, but there is a reason that successful applications have been limited to SMALL parts, not <b>entire</b> rockets. The issue is the mechanical design limits you can work with have wild variance and you need EXTENSIVE testing with each alloy and process to get your hands around it. Getting a reliable S-N curve, Goodman limit, or even just dumb isotropic yield strength is tremendously difficult with this production method. You can try and recover strength by post-treating the surfaces (e.g. post-machining, HIP [lol, for a whole fuel tank?!], peening, or other heat treatments) but the fatigue allowables are still lousy because of all the inevitable inclusions. Else, you just have to rely on wicked good process control while designing to limit peak stress and cyclic loading. Good luck with that in a full-up rocket.<br><br>Also, materials science and materials engineering are NOT the same things. Just because you can produce an alloy that performs well as a coupon doesn&#39;t mean that those properties will hold ubiquitously on a macro scale. I just hope these fellow StarCraft aficionados have accounted for this or the stresses are distributed enough thanks to the unibody design that this thing can survive til MECO before turning into confetti!", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T00:51:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "IDIOT SANDWICH!", "comment_text": "damn, this reminded me of dr stone byakuya reboot manga where the whole satellite was 3d printed.", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T00:43:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny", "comment_text": "Must construct additional pylons.

I as a space detective as we call our selves are very aware of the major cover ups of big companies who have a grip on this field and can easily hide the fact that mars was once exactly life earth as in there were people, very high technology , and after viewing many nasa photos thousands of us are sickened to the core by the cover up lies saying that no intelligent life was ever on mars while the space detectives are looking at ARMY TANKS / carved humanoids/ crashed space craft buildings/ giant people and miniature people.both mummified and carved out of stone . Also plant life / clouds / birds flying/ people looking at the rover / UFOs flying past in photos and in real life today especially on the moon through BRUCE SWARTZ TELESCOPE, and all of this is hushed up instead of being breaking news due to the fact that the media companies are controlled by a very small ELITE AMOUNT OF HUMAN AND ALIEN BEINGS who control earth. I and thousands of other people want the cover up BS TO STOP and to be included in what\u2019s really going on in reality. No one should be able to steal our reality. So I hope when you are ready to get machines and people to mars and the moon and other places that you don\u2019t become controlled by this elite group and try hard to bring us a subscribers channel to see exactly what is going on , on mars and the moon and on earth as we are aware that STAR GATES DO EXIST AND THAT ALIENS ARE AMONGST US AND HAVE BECOME PART OF THE PUPPETEERS THAT PULL OUR STRINGS. SPACEX HAS BECOME UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ELITE SO WE CANT RELY ON THEM TO BRING US THE TRUTH UNFORTUNATELY.

Anyone who gets there first has the power to take any potential resources for themselves for more profit.

And the ironic thing is, that these products end up doing more damage to the environment than the current ones solely because of the requirements of manufacture and the careless behaviour toward using the resources in an environmentally friendly way. The same goes for the West and it\u2019s fossil fuels, but that is slowly running out of interest.

And even if they can survive a single launch, I certainly wouldn&#39;t trust them to be reusable.<br><br>But, doubts aside - I nonetheless applaud this company for working to push the technology forward, and help bring humanity further into space and Mars!", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T03:33:48Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Bari", "comment_text": "How to make thousands of people loose their job tutorial", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T03:33:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "utp216", "comment_text": "Really\u2026.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019.", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T03:03:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chuck Stark", "comment_text": "Industrial humanity at it&#39;s end.

To me this seems wild, but also a little unexplainable.<br><br>Early on in-flight training, we learn that parasite drag affects the aerodynamics of an aircraft (as the force that opposes thrust). This is composed of 1) form drag which is the shape of the aircraft and 2) skin drag - which refers to the smoothness of the external surfaces of the aircraft.<br><br>Most aerospace manufacturers will therefore try and mitigate drag as much as practical, to increase efficiency &amp; performance. It seems weird that Relativity Space has gone for a different approach.<br><br>This raises some questions<br>- Does the rough surface really perform identically to a smooth one for rocket applications? If yes, how/why?<br>-Or is skin drag relatively negligible when compared to wave and form drag?

What we are looking at is dead end, the real holy grail is to print the rocket from steel. But 3D printing has own drowbacks, if we compare Space X Starship, they use precise rolled stainless steel sheet, it is also hardened by rolling and other operations, that mean, that the wall of your tank should be thinner and lighter. On the other hand, 3D print is not creating precise flat sheet, it does oposite, surface of printed sheet is not perfectly flat, it has many hilly places, thicness variess a lot and also it must be thicker, because there are no processes like rolling of steel to provide more strenght and desirable grain structure. 3D print must do further steps, to be competetive in rocket industry. Yes, you can skip lot of parts, but weight matters more, if we talk about rockets. If we make same rocket for same task, I think that 3D printed rocket would be 20-40% heavier, than rocklet made from rolled steel. Because 3D print does not provide perfect flat surface.

It&#39;s closer (so if shiz hits the fan they are easier to rescue (I think it was only a few weeks to the moon, can&#39;t remember) compared to a few months journey and like a 2 year wait (if they are really unlucky) to be able to send people to mars to help (so basically if you screw up on mars your basically completely dead where as with the moon you have a larger chance of survival) , it&#39;s metal rich (from what I remember, so we can build the parts there if we want once we get the whole mining process working (the moon also has water (ice) on it so we can get oxygen and hydrogen (so we basically have the necessary supply (though limited) of oxygen, hydrogen and water to help kick things off)), it has low gravity (lower gravity means less fuel needed for take off meaning we can go further if we use the same rockets on the moon than on earth. lower gravity also means we can move the parts easier meaning we don&#39;t really need to use heavy duty machinery, we just need to secure it properly and ensure we can stop without the part dragging the machinery), the communication time would be shorter and with the moon being the testing grounds for space tech (I.e habitation, mining, food production, waste disposal, etc) it could shorten the time needed to research/create methods to increase the chances of surviving mars without it blowing up in our faces a few months after landing. Induction heating coils can be used for melting the metals and the heat generated from the metal production plants can be piped (using a liquid to circulate it) to the colony, improving energy efficiency because less energy would be needed for heating (one big plant wouldn&#39;t do it if we were providing some heat to a large colony, the pipes heat would lessen over the distance so we would probably need one big plant for main production and a few smaller plants connected to the pipe system along the way (the liquid would also need to be pumped fast so I wont reach it&#39;s boiling point (have no clue if this would work in practice). if your asking where we are going to get the energy from I&#39;d say solar at the start then move to fusion, nuclear or thorium over time as the need for power increases (plus a few gigantic energy storage&#39;s for emergency power). I say solar because 1 day on the moon is I think 24~25 days, so 12 days of sun, and depending on how solar panels improve they may prove useful as a backup when they need to do maintenance or repair a reactor.

This has always been the catalyst for a massive increase in production and ultimately living standards. Start mining asteroids, placing solar collectors, building habitats and other means of reaching orbit like skyhooks, mass drivers, orbital rings etc. These purposes will need lots of rockets to get building materials and even robots in to orbit and will further expand the capabilities of humanity as a whole. Mars doen&#39;t do this, its just a cute  little settlement on a useless planet.

Now, instead of spending extra time improving our application specific models, were are spending time iteratively improving our physical prototypes. Perhaps if any time is left, correcting the models, but that isn&#39;t the priority anymore.

Traditional plumbing can get really complicated, so having it simply be a file is really great for simplicity. Now, Spacex is fabricating raptor engines every few days at this point, but they have a large, fully tooled factory with many machines to do so, but Relativity just needs a 3D printer and some (lots) of wire. <br><br>Building a rocket factory on Mars similar to what they have here is a great move. Because most of what they need is printers and wire feedstock, the supply chain and factory can be set up much more quickly with much less equipment shipped over, which reduces costs significantly. It&#39;ll be exiting to see their rockets fly.<br><br>However, I am concerned about the mass gain on the main rocket body, though. He quoted 5-10%, which does not sound like much, but in aerospace terms, that&#39;s a large reduction in payload. You could make an argument that the cost reduction and speed gain allows more rockets to fly, thus getting more payload to orbit, but another solution to this would just to weld large plates together for the sides of the tanks, which I believe is the traditional way of doing it. Of course, the tradeoff for that method (and thus the performance gain) is the larger amount of ground infrastructure needed to do those welds. If you&#39;re targeting volume production, that&#39;s the way to go, not 3D printing, if just because of the massive reduction in the welds you need to do. 3D printing can only get so fast, and welding plates together is essentially the same as a massive reduction in the tool path length of a 3D print. That&#39;s how SpaceX stacks starships in days/weeks rather than months. You just need the infrastructure available, which can&#39;t be said for Mars, and has a large up-front cost, both in money and materials (not to mention energy).", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:30:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Connor", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz165f1g8-E&amp;t=8m02s\">8:02</a> <b>DragonForce intensifies</b>", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:30:36Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "The Pint-Sized Scientist", "comment_text": "Who loves this concept?

I have a critique/suggestion though about the fuselages.<br>Fuselages of course have to be very light and strong, especially for small vehicles, to get good delta v. You have the tools available to 3D print internal fuselage grids, but don&#39;t use them by printing vertically. I know this goes somewhat against the no tooling idea, but it would be so much more efficient to print a grid on aluminum plates, roll them, and friction stir weld them together. It wouldn&#39;t require that much extra tooling; most companies machine the gridding which is way more expensive and requires huge custom CNC machines. This will reduce the fuselage mass for 3 reasons.<br>1. Even skin thickness. Only minimum skin thickness matters so no wasted material that naturally results from welding in vertical layers like this.<br>2. You can actually do gridding now. By printing the fuselage vertically like this, you just can&#39;t print internal gridding because there&#39;s no support, which I&#39;m sure is the only reason why you don&#39;t.<br>3. Proper aluminum alloy plates are way stronger than these welds, so skin thickness can further be reduced.<br>There are also other benefits like not wasting 90% of print time on the simplest part, which means these rockets can probably be made in a week rather than 60 days.<br>All-in-all you could probably halve the mass of the fuselage by printing on plates, rolling, and then friction stir welding the sections together, and almost doubling the vehicle&#39;s performance.

Yes, it might, but it&#39;s not the quickest or simplest or cheapest or strongest or most proven or most logical. Good engineering - and this very emphatically does hold true in IT and computers and software - is to choose the design and the materials and the tools which are appropriate for the job at hand and use them properly and sensibly to do it. 3d printing the chambers &amp; nozzles like that, I&#39;m all in favour.
