There is no noise of cars, no sounds of nature or even water running. It\u2019s an old mine, forgotten by everyone centuries ago. It is one of the scariest and yet most loved places for me. When you just stand there, looking deep into the weak supports, broken wooden corrupted rails, feel this deep void, sense this place, your problems appear so\u2026 easy\u2026 predictable, controllable in some way. <br>This mine collapsed 1,5 years ago, and it almost made me cry. <br>Why? Because it reminds me about anyones worst friend and enemy, time.<br>AI? Medicine? Physics? All for making more time. While people run for money and joy, I storm my mind to find a way to buy just a millennia of time, learning so much information, searching all the peaks, to find nothing\u2026<br>Sometimes I wonder if there was something in that mine that could help me to solve just even one of major problems in any of the ways I found, <br>but again, I remember that incredibly  loud silence and understand that it was the answer. Silence. <br>I cannot buy time for myself for millennia. Not at any cost of time and work. And even if I do, it would not be \u201cme\u201d anymore. It\u2019s completely different person, with memory of \u201cme\u201d in his past, and all of his iterations in past time\u2026 <br>That\u2019s why I hate philosophy.

There are many reoccurring patterns in nature. Even within our biology there is faint instances of the mandelbrot set in fact its not even faint its almost certain. Veritas has made a video on it now, the human body and populations follow these equations that make up the set. One must wonder, if the Universe truly is driven by causality, if its really predetermined then even this mathematical concept could not manifest within our biology if the Universe doesnt have a mechanism that abides by its function. The missing theory of quantum gravity, can be represented if only through correlation using the mandelbrot set. Its not entirely unlikely that every particle and subatomic particle in the Universe could abide by this concept if one assumes and with good leverage to do so that everything in the Universe is made of little waves or packets of energy. Theres really is no reason for us to assume that the universe is incapable of continuously shrinking itself down into a more dense infinitesimal point to save resources. Its not like we dont have two seemingly prime examples of this occurring in the Universe guys. I mean we really do, both blackholes and the big bang seriously give off these vibes. Almost undeniably so. If all of the information truly is entangled then the quantum field that makes up this vast system of entangled blackholes could be the exact same force all throughout the entire Universe. Even if its just a quantized representation the further down you go, it seems incredibly unlikely to me that this is not the case due to the sheer chances of me being alive to even talk about it. From this perspective the chances of me typing right now are 100% certain due to the density of the infinite chaotic systems that would certainly propagate over and over again in every possible combination. Our consciousness on a more fundamental level may just be this very field, thats continuously weaving in and out of our Universe before our very eyes. In a vast network of correlated information where all combinations of matter, universes, and habitable planets could exist over and over again for eternity.", "comment_date": "2022-09-07T20:14:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B", "comment_text": "this is just one of my panic attacks put into video form lol", "comment_date": "2022-09-07T08:30:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T.S.

I ask this question: Why do we have the ability to think and posit a future, any future at all? Indeed, what&#39;s the point of thought? If we are just animals, subject to the laws of the world always, how is it that we, Alone among all known forms of life, can think, and plan, and change our environment to suit our tastes? Mankind is truly a special and astounding kind of being. So, why can we think about ourselves objectively? Why do so many &quot;near death experience&quot; accounts sound the same, even across time and culture? Take a hard, serious look at those accounts and you will find more questions than answers.

I&#39;ve never commented on any of the videos so far, but I feel like I have to say something here.<br><br>I&#39;m a strong believer in the scientific method and in the great good which modern methods of inquiry yield as a fruit of curiosity, patience, and perseverance. I love what this channel has done to study and explore the myths and superstitions standing between humanity and a better version of humanity. It&#39;s a noble effort, I think, in spite of our general ignorance about the true nature of the universe and our place in it. In some ways, trying to enlighten humanity one video at a time must feel like filling an ocean, one teaspoon at a time.<br><br>At the same time, I&#39;m also a man of faith, with a strong hope in the immortal nature of the human soul - someone you might call &quot;delusional,&quot; I suppose, in the context of this video. I&#39;m not alone in this belief. It would be accepting fallacy as truth to say that the human soul is immortal, just because a vast majority of humans believe that it is, but I think it&#39;s also fallacious to believe that an idea so widely believed across all spectrums of humanity is untrue, simply because it&#39;s old or is difficult to prove scientifically.<br><br>It&#39;s all well and good to say that our biological natures have a strong incentive to seek to &quot;play it safe&quot; by avoiding risk and not realizing its full potential to its limit, but this doesn&#39;t prove that our existence is fundamentally meaningless or that it is limited to our earthly, mortal experiences. This video hasn&#39;t proved the triviality of humankind, it presupposes it, and extremely confidently at that, with no real, substantial evidence to support that presupposition.<br><br>--<br><br>I&#39;ll present an equally-unscientific perspective:<br><br>You may call me closed-minded and gullible, if you wish. I think everyone has a fundamental right to believe whatever they want, however delusional that may be. I choose to believe that our personal existence is not limited to the tiny blip in time we call mortality. Far from limiting my true potential, I find that this perspective helps me walk past the trivial, selfish whims I have to gratify every desire that passes through my mind. Because I believe that my life, my relationships, and the decisions I make will be a part of my eternal identity, I can see my mistakes, not as permanent scars on my soul, but as crucial moments of learning and growth toward my truer, fuller, unlimited potential. It&#39;s true, this perspective restrains me from accomplishing everything I might want to do in the short-term, but it&#39;s not hard to look around and see why unrestrained human desire and ambition is not ideal for anyone.<br><br>--<br><br>I may be wrong. The search for truth requires that we discard our old ideas, but care should be taken not to toss the baby out with the bath water, so to speak.<br><br>This is a channel proclaiming to be devoted to the study and general dissemination of truth, a bold and controversial undertaking to say the least. I love this channel because it seems to be well researched and pretty free from the common internet squabbling I see everywhere else. Truth is a very unmerciful standard however, and requires a high price in due diligence.

I do not believe man will end in our star, so even from a rational perspective I don&#39;t like a video that only presents nihilism without giving considering it&#39;s counter arguments. While I&#39;m used to veritasium taking a scientific perspective, this is pure speculation, and it&#39;s very biased speculation that criticizes a very common viewpoint based purely on an emotional experience. I would appreciate it if before saying that nihilism is superior to belief in an eternal existence you performed some psychological experiments to show that claim. Claiming that a belief in eternity is delusional and debilitating without any evidence is ecclesiophobic, and unscientific. On top of that it alienates people of religious backgrounds from science creating the false narrative that religion and science oppose each other. I can appreciate the experience you had, but as a scientist, I request that you avoid making such far reaching claims without any evidence. If you make claims like that without any evidence you underride the authority of experimentation, and further the false belief that science is just a bunch of smart people forcing their perspectives on others. I would appreciate it if you made a follow up video that had scientific experiments that test to see if a belief in religion is debilitating, a belief in nihilism is debilitating, or if a belief in neither is debilitating as a control group.

For as in Adam all die, even so IN CHRIST SHALL ALL BE MADE ALIVE. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward THEY THAT ARE CHRIST&#39;S AT HIS COMING...For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. THE LAST ENEMY that shall be destroyed is DEATH.&quot; Don&#39;t let your mind be troubled by nihilism. Jesus has overcome the grave. &quot;Have faith in God.&quot;  Mark 11:22. Read the New Testament for YOURSELF and you will see the HOPE OF REDEMPTION that the LORD JESUS CHRIST made possible by his atoning death and his resurrection from the dead.  &quot;We are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it.&quot; Romans 8:24-25.

And several claims about a certainty of &quot;something&quot; that we actually have no empirical knowledge about, i.e. we simply dont know. Yet one possibility is presented as a certainty. But even if that possibility was actually true, the logical inconsistencies i mentioned first would not follow from that, while they are logically inconsistent in on themselves. <br><br>First of, this video and thinking in it presents the usual two simplified binary opposite extremes as if those are actually true and encompass everything, even things we do not know, we only have to decide which one is better. Which is completely wrong and logically untenable. Even if we assume that religious/spiritual idea is simply wrong, we cannot claim some other things are true that we have no evidence for. That&#39;s directly opposite to scientific method and science in general. <br><br>Second, the notion that we are somehow, one way or another eternal or that &quot;there is always another day&quot; and the fact we avoid thinking about our personal deaths - IS actually caused by evolution and our biology. It has an evolutionary advantage and a utility. Yes it also has downsides, but that shouldn&#39;t be taken as anything special since almost everything evolution created has downsides and faults. Evolution is not a perfection making machine. So, nothing substantial can be concluded based only on the fact that these types of thinking and behavior have their downsides. They do, and they also have positive sides. Evolution is messy. Imperfect. Life and living beings are therefore the same. As we can all witness every single day.<br><br>Third, people don&#39;t really have this delusion of permanence. We are all aware of our deaths - and that&#39;s exactly why we push that understanding away, because it is debilitating, paralyzing, destructive. If we were to actually poll people globally, i would bet that we would find very, very few individuals who never - ever - had a moment of realization of their own impending death.<br>We do behave like we think we are permanent, and avoid talking or thinking about personal deaths - but that&#39;s not what we really - really believe. Not even the religious who will do everything, including physical violence to convince others that they are completely convinced in the everlasting permanence - because when they manage to convince others that personal conviction  becomes stronger. <br><br>Yet, we don&#39;t know either way. Scientifically we know such permanence cannot happen in specific ways - but not absolutely. <br>I&#39;m not talking simply about some undiscovered physical properties, but rather that our understanding of time may not be correct. And there is really a lot we don&#39;t yet know in many ways.<br><br>Then there is your notion of &quot;nothingness&quot;, which is a purely human construct. We invented the idea about it based on our own macro universe everyday simple demands and necessities. It has nothing to do with the actual physical universe in which real &quot;nothing&quot; as we imagine it - does not exist. There is no &quot;nothing&quot; in this Universe, everything is something. And we also have no idea what was &quot;before&quot; the big bang&quot;. We actually do not know there was a &quot;nothing&quot; before &quot;it&quot;. We assume, but we do not know. <br><br>Then there is your notion about what nihilism is, which is very strange, because what you describe is not nihilism at all. It&#39;s the opposite of it.<br>No, the &quot;delusion&quot; or simply put, refusal to constantly be aware of our deaths is not debilitating, nor does it make people procrastinate. It can look so in some cases but such debilitation and procrastination are not caused by it, because the same happens to people who are nihilistic or don&#39;t believe in eternal souls and whatever other form of that idea. Nihilist also live in more fear and don&#39;t do anything to &quot;live the life they desire&quot; - because it&#39;s all meaningless to them, there is no point in desiring anything - because everything is meaningless. Right? <br>Unless we are talking about some other kind of nihilism i don&#39;t know about.<br><br>A sense that your soul is eternal makes you cowardly? Really? That&#39;s based on what proof or evidence? I&#39;ve never seen such behavior, and plenty directly opposite to it.<br>Shame and disappointment would never leave you - because you are eternal? Do you know a single person that thinks like that? I don&#39;t. Never seen one, never even heard of anyone like that, religious or not. Obviously, practically all religions are built around avoiding that - to the point eternal life is not tenable unless a person behaves better and or makes an effort to improve themselves. Im not religious, This is simply how things actually are.<br><br>All people try to avoid shame, pain and disappointment for reason that have nothing to do with their personal understanding of how eternal they are. Not to mention every single religion has their strongest commandments and punishments against behaving is such ways. On the other hand the real nihilism cannot serve as a motivation against such behavior because to a nihilist none of it makes any sense or has any meaning. So its meaningless if they behave like that or not and the only thing that matters is to destroy themselves and anything else they can, because its all meaningless, right? (obviously that kind of ideology and thinking is also logically broken and nonsense but thats how the real nihilism works).<br> <br>You even claim that if we could face the eventual nothingness that would make us less afraid and it would mean that errors and mistakes would be forgotten...  - but that leads directly into making more of errors and mistakes - because they will be forgotten so they dont matter, are not important or worth worrying about. And then you claim great achievements may not be forgotten? How is that possible in that scenario? Nobody gives a flying f about what happened 10 years ago, let alone 50 or a 100. The great pyramids are cheap tourist attractions now. Surrounded by hovels or Cairo and only serve to extract a few more dollars from gullible tourists who only come there once, get bored after 10 minutes and then forget about it in constant rush to find something new. And how would exactly nihilists value anything at all?<br><br>This is an old video but i just had to comment, because such logical paradoxes from this channel are especially annoying and rage inducing. I hope you upgraded your thinking since this was made. Our existence is not meaningless - as you said yourself - we create the meaning.

Some are closer to the Truth but it is a distorted version of the Truth as seen through a belief. <br><br>Once called a spiritual distortion, a mental wound, an error in thinking, a bad assumption, a lie that everything the humans claim to know, that all they have built their world of opposition, meaning war, strife, discord, and indifference upon. <br><br>The flawed foundation they each have copied in their own way and used to build their house of cards, their deck of imagined values they use to battle each other for the right to work for the same fews profit. To earn the paper money they can use to buy the privilege they just call freedom. Their house of cards which they have been conditioned to create from the cards they were each born with. The few cards they had no choice but to accept and the values of those cards they had no power to change that they use to create the deck they use to play their little game of war. Opposition is not competition and nothing humans do is competition. Doesn\u2019t matter what you call it, even if you all call it competition and believe your words, human words and definitions dictate the nature of reality. <br><br>The fundamental flaw know as the alpha male. The error of sick children who didn\u2019t like what Nature gave them. The sick proud little boys who wanted to be in charge. So they have raged a war against Nature, against each other and looked at the world through a belief. A belief they insist is reality through violence, rape, theft and a thousand stories created from the Truth to teach the world a Lie.<br><br>Sick animals who told themselves a thousand stories they copied from the males because they liked the role the stories cast them in. They liked how it made them feel. It was what everyone else was doing, it was easier, it was just the way things are, how grown ups do things.<br><br>Be it Moses, Plato, or Darwin. Be it a Religious Faith, a Philosophical Law, a Scientific Theory it is all the same thing in reality, a guess as to the nature of this reality, as to the meaning, purpose, and value of all Life, including yours. <br><br>What told humans they could do anything they have done? What told them they could destroy over half the non human species of Life in pursuit of all the things that grown up humans love? What told them human, specifically the bearded humans words create and dictate reality and assign meaning, value and purpose to all Life, including yours? <br><br>It wasn\u2019t anything any of you even bothered to check in reality was truth because you liked the answer. But its just a guess, no matter what you call Belief doesn\u2019t change reality. It doesn\u2019t change anything except the believers perception of reality if they foolishly forget their prudence and can\u2019t be honest.<br><br>Truth is never kind but it is always simple. It only gets complicated when you don\u2019t like the Truth. The Truth hurts, it hurts both to hear but also to say especially to someone you truly love who doesn\u2019t want to hear it. <br><br>You can tell yourself you are protecting someone you love by lying to them and this is love true. But there are many kinds of Love and they all feel good, they all feel the same, but only one love is true. True Love is unconditional. It doesn\u2019t lie to those it loves and tell itself it is protecting them from pain. That is love too and we all have made that choice because we are human. We make mistakes. We are not perfect. The Law, meaning Nature is. The Balance always corrects itself and humans have acted on their guesses as if they were reality. And you each accepted the flawed males theories, laws, theories and no j ew force you to copy and repeat the answers you are told from childhood you have the great privilege called freedom.

The faith that Veritasium puts in 21st century science is disturbingly blinkered. Science has not yet begun to approach the biggest questions: What is consciousness? What defines &quot;now&quot;? (The equations of physics certainly don&#39;t.) Why, after a century, do we still not have a consensus on what quantum mechanics is telling us about the nature of reality? (Last I checked, there were at least 6 competing &quot;interpretations&quot; of QM.) Why are our two most successful theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, so hard to reconcile? (The chances that string theory is correct seem extremely small, after 35 years of research with no predictions.) And perhaps the toughest one: why is there anything at all? Or, in the context of the video, why, if at one point there was truly nothing - no mathematics, physics, space, time, anything at all - how can there now be something?<br>So writing off the idea that the seat of our consciousness might be eternal smacks of the same kind of myopic thinking (that science has almost all the answers) that stymied physics towards the end of the 19th century.

The question is if you believe that there is a force bigger than that who isn&#39;t governed by the laws of our universe. A force that created matter and energy. A force that created time. You can&#39;t get something from nothing, at least not by the scientific laws we are bound by. The scientific laws that had to be written by an external force. And when we die, we could be taken from this universe. Our brains cannot comprehend infinity or eternity, but if you think about looking into the sky and looking past the clouds, past the atmosphere and the solar system, past the galaxy, past all the galaxies in the known universe, there has to, at some point, be an end. But what is beyond that end. <br>Knowing there is life after death doesn&#39;t make you complacent or fearful. It makes you hopeful. Life has a purpose and meaning when you know that you can impact the eternity of those around you. Life is given to us so that we may live it to the full. <br>But like the stone, the world and everything in it is crumbling and eroding away. Even our DNA is eroding and with every generation the earth and everything in it is getting sicker and dying. Millions of creatures go extinct and no new ones take their place. New species arise from mutations, but the mutations are made out of damaged eroded DNA and instead of being better than their ancestors, they are worse. <br>The earth was created to be perfect, but since we have rejected the creator, it has been left to it&#39;s own devices, and without upkeep, it crumbles. Like those abandoned buildings after Chernobyl. Our bodies are many times more complex than cities, filled with workers busily keeping everything running. They are full of trash and corruption. They have abandoned buildings that are crumbling. Eventually maintenance won&#39;t be able to keep up with repairs and we will crumble. We only have a limited time on this earth and every bit of it makes and eternal difference. But, if I&#39;m wrong... what difference does it make. It makes no sense to work hard if you&#39;re just going to disappear into nothingness anyway. <br>The devil&#39;s greatest trick is making us believe that we don&#39;t need God.", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T20:24:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "giobikefans", "comment_text": "One thing is guaranteed, your personal universe has a less than 105 year shelf life.

But your philosophy is flawed.  Our greatest delusion is that because we can\u2019t perceive something then it doesn\u2019t exist.  In the case of this video, you assume we are \u201cimpermanent\u201d because life after death is not perceptible by our current faculties\u2014like a baby thinking that people blink out of existence when they are not visible.   Spiritual life after bodily death is real otherwise this life is entirely pointless.   People are not animals who lack self awareness.  Humans are higher order beings with a soul capable of abstract reasoning and conceptualization.  Like it or not, people are eternal in spirit.  <br><br>The question is what happens when that spirit leaves the body.  This is not a question that can be answered by science or philosophy.  Ultimately, it falls into the category of faith or if you prefer \u201creligion\u201d.  Apparently your faith (because you have no proof that your view is reality) says people just cease to exist after the body dies.  But there are other faiths \u2014 equally as valid as yours \u2014 that acknowledge the existence of an omnipotent creator God and the reality of the eternal human soul.  There is no way for people to know or choose the correct \u201cfaith\u201d apart from the intervention of God in their lives to reveal himself.  And choosing the correct faith matters practically because it determines our entire world view which directly affects our attitude and life choices \u2014 for better or worse.   And more importantly, choosing the correct faith also matters for our eternal souls.  So at the end of the day we are left with one appropriate action (assuming we choose to believe that our individual lives have an eternal purpose) and that is to humble ourselves and appeal to the God of creation to reveal himself to us and provide guidance that behooves our eternal souls.  <br><br>My faith is in the God of the Bible and His Son Jesus Christ who sacrificed himself for my sins and was raised from the dead for for my justification.

(And is now in blissful non existence...)<br><br>So let\u2019s keep putting our hopes in buying and building more stuff we don\u2019t need\u2014and while we\u2019re at it enriching a few people at the cost of the many (the earth)... as it\u2019s all meaningless.<br><br>I actually can\u2019t imagine a worse message and a bigger lie that you could put on utoob for people to gobble up\u2014literally pushing them that much closer to becoming sociopaths in the process.<br><br>There is more to our existence. Our minds are being controlled, herded into this kind of thinking, as if it were freeing us\u2014but it\u2019s purpose (agenda) is to destroy us (just look at the evidence). When we finally hit the \u2018dead end\u2019 that it leads to\u2014then it\u2019s too late. Seek your origins\u2014don\u2019t just settle with the idea that evolution somehow provides the answer.", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T19:25:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G MC", "comment_text": "=the result of years of mind control, not expansion. The logic that we choose various beliefs \u2018merely\u2019 for the sake of comfort to combat the discomfort of \u2018reality\u2019 is deluded.<br><br>Why? Because there is indeed comfort to be had\u2014however, the logic that says we only seek comfort to avoid the reality that our lives are utterly pointless, is the real delusion. And just think how your mind works\u2014you think you can trust the logic because if there is no reward in believing it\u2014it must therefore be true. But that logic is actually rewarding! (We are being bribed\u2014which is mind controlling.)<br><br>The philosophy that our existence is completely random and therefore \u2018meaningless\u2019\u2014conveniently removes personal responsibility from mankind\u2014therefore we ought to choose whatever makes us feel good. Nihilism is an old philosophy and it surely does lead us to our second death (complete lights out as you put it) as the phrase \u2018eat, drink\u2014be merry\u2014for tomorrow we die\u2019, expresses well. When we believe that virtue is merely a man made idea\u2014&gt;then we can say evil is good/good is evil. Which means things like \u2018capitalism\u2019 is \u2018good\u2019 (evil). Eg. Jobs outweigh environmental concerns, etc... economic growth is more important than life.<br><br>Clearly Nihilism means the total destruction of mankind. It\u2019s how we create sociopathy and psychopathy. (Greed is good.)<br><br>Ridiculous? How do you expect people to restrain themselves from \u201cevil\u201d, if it doesn\u2019t even exist? And \u2018restraint\u2019?that\u2019s hard to do\u2014as it\u2019s a virtue\u2014which apparently also doesn\u2019t exist, nor does it make you immediately happy to practice. Nihilism is anarchy (vice=virtue), and without a consensus on what is good or right or wrong, requires extreme policing\u2014as disagreement/lack of concern is a main feature... getting caught breaking the \u2018rules\u2019 is the only reason to not be a complete slave to our self gratification\u2014it can\u2019t compel you with doing good (as one persons good is another person\u2019s bad).<br><br>And if \u2018restraint\u2019 for example is argued to lead to a greater happiness in the longer term, then you are heading back towards it being a virtue\u2014which a nihilist will say is just an evolutionary choice that lead towards viability? So then we say evolution is the judge of right and wrong? Sounds a bit like religion\u2014if our creator is the ultimate authority and not our desires... so then who cares\u2014evolution is meaningless, as it\u2019s random. This logic looks like the ouroboros.<br><br>Reality is your conclusions are wrong, as they logically follow a faulty premise. When you don\u2019t know where you come from or why\u2014you don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s for no reason and then carry on basing every decision in your life on that assumption. As you become deluded\u2014which means you can\u2019t see the truth even when it\u2019s glaring you in the face.<br><br>I don\u2019t say any of this because I was needy for some comforting. I don\u2019t \u2018need\u2019 the comfort provided by some random delusion. I did however find comfort in breaking free from this thought prison you have found yourself trapped in. On the contrary, we are richly rewarded for breaking free from the mind control of this \u2018world\u2019 that alters our perception of reality to kind of \u2018flat earth\u2019 existence we are being sold. There is indeed a great reward in pursuing truth. Which you would say great, I agree, me too? But you can\u2019t access the truth\u2014like Pavlov\u2019s dog, every time your bell is rung you think you are on the right path. You are only allowed to play within the confines of the fixed laws of the physical\u2014that\u2019s all there is, right? (Yet some are now saying they didn\u2019t even exist before some time after the \u2018beginning\u2019.)<br><br>To break free one ought to return back to our child like \u2018quest\u2019ioning. Where do we come from, why are we here... and never accept the pressure to conform to the idea, that it\u2019s merely your own discomfort you seek to irrationally silence\u2014with comforting delusions. These people literally have know idea how or why we are here! They are all victims of severe mind control, and if listened to as if they are authorities on the question why\u2014you will be blind like them too, unable to see the answers to the very QUESTions that are built into us... Just don\u2019t forget your \u2018sword\u2019, cause when you go up against the dragon it will try and eat you too. Resistance is not futile\u2014but you need to know that evil is indeed real and behind this mind control we suffering from... (Just ask yourself why it seems we can\u2019t stop the march towards our collective destruction\u2014and yet take some hope in what appears to be futile thinking.)<br><br>This video is only reveals what happens to your \u2018perspective\u2019 when you follow the same path.", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T17:29:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Declan Dally", "comment_text": "&quot;So I&#39;ll continue to continue <br>To pretend that my life will never end <br>And flowers never bend with the rainfall.&quot;<br>- if you know it you know it", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T15:35:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hamna Shafqat", "comment_text": "Why do you keep changing the title?", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T08:53:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matires", "comment_text": "By commenting on a video, you\u2019re essentially writing your name in stone.

Who would want to live their lives thinking that they have no control over their actions and that their consciousness is just a fabrication of their imagination?<br>Lastly I would point out that naturalism or materialism entails in believing there are no objective moral principles, so next time someone would argue with you that racism isn&#39;t bad or that school shootings are ok you would be obliged to take a morally neutral position because what might be wrong for you might not be for him.<br>Without a moral law giver there is no moral law.<br>In the end it&#39;s up to us to choose which kind of world we would like to live in. Do we want to believe in a God that is just and merciful? Do we want to believe in a society that shows love for neighbor and strives to sacrifice the individual for the whole? Or do we want to live in a society that believes that we are a self propagating accident that&#39;s highest calling is to fullfil our physical desires?", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T16:20:41Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Jelle Donders", "comment_text": "MonkaS", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T15:04:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mellissa Dalby", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t want to last forever.

I am the very best version of myself. When I was a nihilist, my life had no meaning and whatever was pleasing to my senses was god, making me base and animalistic, and I was not the best version of myself. What I am saying is subjective, just as what you espouse is subjective belief. You see our sense of being eternal as an evolutionary coping mechanism for pending death, whereas I see that same sense placed there by design by a loving God who desires us to return His love and find eternity with Him. You might think belief in God is restricting potential, where I see faith and obedience to the ultimate Higher Order as guard rails on your fifth story balcony. Rules of faith are there for our good, not as restrictions anymore than a seatbelt is a restriction.  <br><br>But we cannot ignore revealed religion. God reveals himself over time to His creation, and we are able to come to a (very limited) understanding of Him. Besides the countless scientists and revolutionary figures in my own Catholic tradition, Jesus himself said the following, and you just might like it:<br><br>When [Jesus] came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:\r<br>\r<br>\u201cBlessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!\u201d<br>\r<br>\u201cPeace in heaven and glory in the highest!\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, \u201cTeacher, rebuke your disciples!\u201d\r<br>\r<br>\u201cI tell you,\u201d he replied, \u201cif they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.\u201d<br><br>I believe the stones still cry out, as you have intuited. All this order you bring so intelligently to YouTube cannot be from billions of years of random chance events. There is an efficient cause, a first Mover if you will. You see so much around you and are a witness to so much, but yet come to the conclusion that there is no Creator behind any of it.

S.", "comment_text": "The idea that we would be cowardly in immortality and forever guilty of our mistakes doesn&#39;t make any sense. Immortality would give us the confidence to fail and stand up again and learn and rise over and over to forever grow and develop ourselves. No wonder our fictional superheroes are immortal or effectively immortal. Fear of failure can only come if you think that failure will have lasting consequences for as long as you exist, and as long as you care about the consequences. Do you care about the consequences? If you think that there is value in nihilism, then why do you care about the consequences? You chose to have a family, to experience the world, to experience beauty, to be a good citizen, to respect law and order, and essentially to live a meaningful and productive life discovering the world. So, it is logically impossible that the idea that we can accept the emptiness and meaninglessness of a future looming in the horizon, can live hand-in-hand with the idea of living a life as if it had meaning. You cannot produce meaning in the present knowing and believing that the future has no meaning. It is not possible. And you cannot transfer meaning to another being to effectively turn your existence immortal after you are gone, if you believe that ultimately every life will reduce to dust and every bit of individuality and consciousness will disintegrate into nothingness. If the whole universe has no beginning, no end, no goal, no purpose, no meaning, then nothing at any point in space or time has meaning, and as such, you cannot claim to embrace nihilism when you don&#39;t in fact live your life as a true nihilist. You are still living with meaning. So, where is the delusion? Is the delusion to fool ourselves into forgetting about the nothingness and meaninglessness to come? Is the delusion the conscious acceptance of a transient meaning, while ignoring the inevitable logical conclusion that there can be no meaning for the individual in the present without somehow the individual being eternal? Or is the delusion the very idea that consciousness or individuality doesn&#39;t carry over, and that existence ultimately has no meaning? It is self-evident that people thrive by living as if they matter and as if their existence and their experiences have meaning and purpose. You can argue that this is just how we happen to be programmed, by mere chance, and that ultimately this is also a delusion. But one cannot seriously claim to believe that, while living a life with goals, aspirations, motivations, ambitions and desires. There is no other possible outcome for the nihilist than to be a fool. He&#39;s a fool to call himself one while not truly being one, and he&#39;s a fool to be the true one who does the only thing that a true nihilist does which is to end his own existence, because he then believes the ideas created in his own delusional mind. So, to me nihilism doesn&#39;t offer any solution, but only new philosophical problems which are frankly not that hard to solve. Nihilism sabotages our quest for truth and our thirst for life. Look, the logic is simple. The only intelligent way to live life is to live as if life continues somehow after death, for the simple reason that we only have something to lose if that turns out to be true, and we turned out to have lived a misguided life that was counter-productive to our existence in the future. If it turns out that in death we disappear and cease to exist as individual or consciousness, then how we lived won&#39;t make any difference to you or to anybody. Luckily, we seem hard-wired to pursue a life productively and with meaning, so the job of living as if there is life after death is not that difficult.

The video is filled with a &quot;tone&quot; to suggest that life has meaning and is beautiful, yet his words suggest quite the opposite. <br><br>We have to be very careful with nihilism. If we as a species would come to embrace nihilism; think about what that would mean. It means there is no reason to protect life. Someone who is suffering has zero reason to fight through it and should rather just kill themselves. In fact, all those African children dying of hunger; we should just kill them all to put them out of their misery. The more we apply the &quot;theory&quot; and act accordingly with it in our daily lives, the more horrifying the world becomes. The simple truth is that the reason that a nihilist today can feel fulfilled is that time has engrained him with the values of the society he is surrounded by. A society that has been formed, molded, by beliefs such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism; all beliefs that include eternity and an afterlife. Now, is there an afterlife and are these beliefs accurate? That is another topic. However, if there ISN&#39;T an afterlife, life has zero meaning. There really is no debate to this. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you live life in fear or in fulfilment, because once you die, you&#39;ll never remember it. Fear, failure, success, love, loneliness, murder, theft, drugs. They are all of equal outcome. If you find fulfilment in suicide bombing a skyscraper, go right ahead.  That&#39;s why this video just seems so contradictory to me, and irrational. <br><br>Now, before you go jump off a cliff, I want to share something which to me is quite interesting. My dad was an agnostic, who had a very &quot;Hume&#39;esque&quot; way of thinking bordering on nihilism. He was also a very rational person, and smart enough to study physics in MIT, to later become an economist (he&#39;s worked in the IMF, World Bank, Ministry of economics of Nicaragua, and the HKMA in Hong Kong). The thing is, at one point in his life (aged 21, I believe), he reached rock bottom. He felt life had no meaning, he was a social recluse, and so he decided to pray. Quite simply, he prayed to God &quot;I give up, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s true, I need help&quot;. He decided soon afterwards to visit a seminary near Hamburg, Germany (where he lived at the time) and met with one of the seminarists for advice. The man told him something along the line of &quot;don&#39;t think so much about yourself, try to think of others&quot;. My dad didn&#39;t really feel much different right afterwards, and the words were kinda empty. Soon afterwards, however, and he hadn&#39;t even had a chance to put the seminarists words into practice, he says he felt a sudden &quot;feeling&quot; (he doesn&#39;t use the word feeling, because it was more akin to &quot;knowledge&quot;) out of nowhere that he describes as an immense paternal love for him from someone very real. A love so powerful and real that he says he was more sure of its existence than his own existence. He is now 74, and has been a devout Catholic since that moment. Far from feeling &quot;afraid of failure&quot;, as Veritasium mentions, he felt an immense peace which, though it didn&#39;t last forever, gave him a hope, an assurance, that life doesn&#39;t end here, that it has meaning. He is one of the most serene and peaceful individuals I know.<br><br>I have not yet had that same experience and not every good Christian does, but damn, does it give you something to think about. Veritasium is very right that a belief like Christianity can cause someone to be afraid and fear failure, but only because its true message has been distorted, and because people don&#39;t have that direct relationship with God, which is what Christianity is all about. It isn&#39;t about doing this or not doing that, it&#39;s about loving God and Him loving you. Once that relationship is established, then doing the right thing isn&#39;t a chore, it&#39;s a blessing. Unfortunately, many Christians have twisted the meaning to be opposite: follow laws, so that then you can know God, when in fact, it should be &quot;know God, so that you can follow (and love) the law (which is simply natural law; that which if we follow, we&#39;ll be happier; it isn&#39;t even a strictly religious term).<br><br>Mind you, we SHOULD live like every day is our last, because eternity isn&#39;t simply an addition of time, it is an echo of what we do now. The concept of hell isn&#39;t something to make you fear failure, quite the opposite, it should drive you to act, but in peace, with the knowledge that God will guide you. Ultimately, hell is our choice of abandoning that which makes us happy. There really is no greater hell than choosing to believe life has no meaning, and living according to that. The knowledge of hell is actually a blessing. A call to act. Which doesn&#39;t mean we should despair if we don&#39;t act this once. Strive ever to get better, but never despair. God will eventually get you out. Above all, hope. That is my message to anyone who sees this and feels empty.", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T15:42:43Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Smith VR", "comment_text": "I think the greatest delusion is free will.

So give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward.<br>(12) Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things We have enumerated in a clear register.<br>(19) Not equal are the blind and the seeing,<br>(20) Nor are the darknesses and the light,<br>(21) Nor are the shade and the heat,<br>(22) And not equal are the living and the dead. Indeed, Allah causes to hear whom He wills, but you cannot make hear those in the graves.<br>(23) You, [O Muhammad], are not but a warner.<br>(24) Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner.<br>(25) And if they deny you - then already have those before them denied. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening Scripture.<br>(26) Then I seized the ones who disbelieved, and how [terrible] was My reproach.<br>(27) Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby fruits of varying colors? And in the mountains are tracts, white and red of varying shades and [some] extremely black.<br>(28) And among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly. Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Forgiving.<br>(29) Indeed, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish prayer and spend [in His cause] out of what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, [can] expect a profit that will never perish -<br>(30) That He may give them in full their rewards and increase for them of His bounty. Indeed, He is Forgiving and Appreciative.<br>(31) And that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], of the Book is the truth, confirming what was before it. Indeed, Allah, of His servants, is Acquainted and Seeing.<br>(32) Then we caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants; and among them is he who wrongs himself, and among them is he who is moderate, and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of Allah. That [inheritance] is what is the great bounty.<br>(33) [For them are] gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be silk.<br>(34) And they will say, &quot;Praise to Allah, who has removed from us [all] sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative -<br>(35) He who has settled us in the home of duration out of His bounty. There touches us not in it any fatigue, and there touches us not in it weariness [of mind].&quot;<br>(36) And for those who disbelieve will be the fire of Hell. [Death] is not decreed for them so they may die, nor will its torment be lightened for them. Thus do we recompense every ungrateful one.<br>(37) And they will cry out therein, &quot;Our Lord, remove us; we will do righteousness - other than what we were doing!&quot; But did We not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember, and the warner had come to you? So taste [the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper.<br>(38) Indeed, Allah is Knower of the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and earth. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.<br>(39) It is He who has made you successors upon the earth. And whoever disbelieves - upon him will be [the consequence of] his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their Lord except in hatred; and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss.<br>(40) Say, &quot;Have you considered your &#39;partners&#39; whom you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created from the earth, or have they partnership [with Him] in the heavens? Or have We given them a book so they are [standing] on evidence therefrom? [No], rather, the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion.&quot;<br>(41) Indeed, Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease. And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.<br>(42) And they swore by Allah their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than [any] one of the [previous] nations. But when a warner came to them, it did not increase them except in aversion.<br>(43) [Due to] arrogance in the land and plotting of evil; but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people. Then do they await except the way of the former peoples? But you will never find in the way of Allah any change, and you will never find in the way of Allah any alteration.<br>(44) Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? And they were greater than them in power. But Allah is not to be caused failure by anything in the heavens or on the earth. Indeed, He is ever Knowing and Competent.<br>(41) And a sign for them is that We carried their forefathers in a laden ship.<br>(42) And We created for them from the likes of it that which they ride.<br>(43) And if We should will, We could drown them; then no one responding to a cry would there be for them, nor would they be saved<br>(44) Except as a mercy from Us and provision for a time.<br>(45) But when it is said to them, &quot;Beware of what is before you and what is behind you; perhaps you will receive mercy... &quot;<br>(46) And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except that they are from it turning away.<br>(47) And when it is said to them, &quot;Spend from that which Allah has provided for you,&quot; those who disbelieve say to those who believe, &quot;Should we feed one whom, if Allah had willed, He would have fed? You are not but in clear error.&quot;<br>(48) And they say, &quot;When is this promise, if you should be truthful?&quot;<br>(49) They do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing.<br>(50) And they will not be able [to give] any instruction, nor to their people can they return.<br>(51) And the Horn will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten.<br>(52) They will say, &quot;O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?&quot; [The reply will be], &quot;This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.&quot;<br>(53) It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought present before Us.<br>(54) So today no soul will be wronged at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do.<br>(55) Indeed the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be amused in [joyful] occupation -<br>(56) They and their spouses - in shade, reclining on adorned couches.<br>(57) For them therein is fruit, and for them is whatever they request [or wish]<br>(58) [And] &quot;Peace,&quot; a word from a Merciful Lord.<br>(59) [Then He will say], &quot;But stand apart today, you criminals.<br>(60) Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy -<br>(61) And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.<br>(62) And he had already led astray from among you much of creation, so did you not use reason?<br>(63) This is the Hellfire which you were promised.<br>(64) [Enter to] burn therein today for what you used to deny.&quot;<br>(65) That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to earn.<br>(66) And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes, and they would race to [find] the path, and how could they see?<br>(67) And if We willed, We could have deformed them, [paralyzing them] in their places so they would not be able to proceed, nor could they return.<br>(68) And he to whom We grant long life We reverse in creation; so will they not understand?<br>(69) And We did not give Prophet Muhammad, knowledge of poetry, nor is it befitting for him. It is not but a message and a clear Qur&#39;an<br>(70) To warn whoever is alive and justify the word against the disbelievers.<br>(71) Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our hands have made, grazing livestock, and [then] they are their owners?<br>(72) And We have tamed them for them, so some of them they ride, and some of them they eat.<br>(73) And for them therein are [other] benefits and drinks, so will they not be grateful?<br>(74) But they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that perhaps they would be helped.<br>(75) They are not able to help them, and they [themselves] are for them soldiers in attendance.<br>(76) So let not their speech grieve you. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they declare.<br>(77) Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] sperm-drop - then at once he is a clear adversary?<br>(78) And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, &quot;Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?&quot;<br>(79) Say, &quot;He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing.&quot;<br>(80) [It is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then from it you ignite.<br>(81) Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them? Yes, [it is so]; and He is the Knowing Creator.<br>(82) His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, &quot;Be,&quot; and it is.<br>(83) So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.", "comment_date": "2020-02-01T17:47:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Py-Guru-JEE by Krishal Sharma", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKR-HydGohQ&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a><br>I never noticed &#39;42&#39;", "comment_date": "2020-01-27T10:50:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheLonelyShadow", "comment_text": "unus anus the prequel", "comment_date": "2020-01-14T22:28:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lily Wang", "comment_text": "Every day there will be another that come after it; Every moment there will be another that come after it.

Playing it safe for tomorrow, since tomorrow will surely come.<br><br><br>We make meaning everyday with each other.<br><br><br>Our Greatest Delusion: The thought that we are in any way Eternal<br><br><br>Diamonds are forever<br>We sculpt our heroes in stone<br><br><br>I&#39;m getting tired and will have to leave my thoughts unfinished, but suffice it to say I was pleasantly surprised how the pure honesty of your soliloquy rendered these assertions docile to the touch, rather than enmitous or nihilistic in effect :)<br>And I will also say I do not thing a belief in eternity necessarily propends to procrastination or cowardice. I do not believe that it ought to if the truths of eternity are properly understood... Anyway...

The ideas of nihilism make me feel like life isn&#39;t worth living, as least not in any good way. I mean, what is the point of spending your whole life trying to build relationships with people and create a legacy if they are all going to die anyway and no one will ever remember you? If mankind is a meaningless speck in the cosmos than anything I could ever in this life would be pathetic by comparison to everything else in the universe. Even if I single handedly ended world hunger and poverty overnight, what does it matter? All those people whose lives I changed are all going to die within a century and forget about all of it, the good and the bad. And the universe as a whole would not even notice. It makes me feel like the only way to live is to lie,  cheat,  steal, kill, sleep around, and get high as much as possible before I die, because work sucks, and when I die it is all over, so why not do whatever the heck I feel like doing in the moment and enjoy my brief blip amidst eternity? \r<br>On the other hand, thinking that mankind might be eternal gives meaning to my life is dozens of ways. It means that any little kindness I show anyone will be forever etched into that mind and heart that I touched and will endure throughout eternity. It also means that any bad thing I do will theoretically be remembered forever, so it motivates me to be good rather than evil. It also means that any relationships I build here will have a chance to exist afterwards, and that gives even more meaning to interactions with friends and family. And while people may die and leave mortality, if our consciousness continues on, then anything I learn and experience in this life will carry one with me, so it motivates me to learn more, become better, to learn how to be happier, more productive, and contribute more, and never stop progressing. This also means that my potential is beyond the current comprehension of humanity. Think about it. How much can a person learn and grow in 100 years? Now imagine if that person had a 100,000,000 years instead. How much would they grow and learn then? Would anything be beyond their ability? Wouldn&#39;t they be able to learn enough about science and build enough capital to single handedly create and run an entire galaxy all by themselves? \r<br>As for failures, people are going to remember your failures whether there is life after death or not. They will remember it during the whole of mortality, so the only way to escape your failures is to kill the people that remember them, or else kill yourself so you don&#39;t have to deal with it. That isn&#39;t very liberating in my opinion. \r<br>However, believing in a God who can forgive sins is liberating. It means that even if you did screw up those mistakes can be wiped away, whether here or in the hereafter, and so you can actually let go of your troubled past and live in peace and tranquility, only focusing on the present, the future, and the good moments of the past. \r<br>But that isn&#39;t all. Believing in an afterlife also means that I don&#39;t have to rush around life like a chicken with my head cut off trying to do, be, and experience everything before my turn is over. It means that I can live life at a relaxed pace knowing that if there is something that I didn&#39;t get to do here I will have an eternity to do it later. It also means that I don&#39;t have to fear death because death is merely a transition from one phase of life to a other. Like going from high to college. \r<br>Believing in a God expands that even more though. Believing in an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God means that anything that is bad or unpleasant about my life can and will be fixed at some loony in the future. If I am ugly now, and God loves me, he will want me to be handsome so I can be happier. This means that at some point in eternity he will change me from ugly to handsome. Likewise if I am crippled, or socially awkward or bad a sports, or cowardly, or cruel, or undisciplined, then at some point in the future all of those problems will be fixed. But is also works for external problems too, like being poor, or suffering from a terrible illness, or being denied opportunities, or suffering pain and discomfort. A just and merciful and loving God would not allow that to go on forever. Eventually he would stop it and reverse it, compensating us for all of the bad things we experienced in life, or for all of the good things that we DIDN&#39;T get to experience in life. In other words, God can&#39;t stop people from hurting others, because that would impinge oontheir free will and so would be unjust, so he has to let us suffer. BUT there is nothing stopping him from compensating us for everything we suffer. In fact, if he really is just and merciful and kind he would be obligated to compensate us for everything that we suffer in this life. I believe that is exactly what will happen when we move on to whatever is after mortality. \r<br>Some of those compensations could very well occur in mortality, but I don&#39;t think most of them will occur in this life, because the very nature of this life includes free will, and the duality of Joy and suffering Together. But God promises that at some point in the future those 2 things go will be separated, and mankind will be sent to live in the part where joy and goodness alone resides.\r<br>So when you compare nihilism to this version of an afterlife, it makes nihilism look like a welfare check compared to a trillion dollar trust fund inheritance.", "comment_date": "2019-07-04T20:49:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TigerChills", "comment_text": "I&#39;m glad that the silence at the end of the video wasn&#39;t spoiled by a buzzing speech how great Audible is", "comment_date": "2019-07-04T17:59:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "IssTrue", "comment_text": "Is he ok?", "comment_date": "2019-07-04T14:22:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BulbasaurLeaves", "comment_text": "Death doesn&#39;t give life meaning.

There&#39;s no such thing as a great shot or great pass or great possession etc because there&#39;s is no objective...just meaningless action. Greatness and motivation and all that good stuff cannot be gleaned from true Nihilism - that&#39;s the delusion here. The true Nihilist realizes that ALL of existence will perish and the individual is free &amp; justified in doing whatever they please.

Scientific minds like ours should understand this best of all.  This video is dated, and perhaps your thoughts are now different.

His &quot;Intelligence Staircase&quot; graphic, presented in part 2 of his &quot;AI Revolution&quot; post, ironically presents a very strong argument against denying the possibility of a benign and sovereign God.  The paragraph just below the aforementioned graphic illustrates very well why one can not reject this possibility based on our human-level understanding of what such a God should and should not allow (e.g. pain and suffering).  At any rate, Tim&#39;s post is an excellent read.<br><br><br>For further study on the possible validity of Christianity after all, I recommend reading the Gospels of John and Luke in the Bible (for starters), using the Read Scripture app (free) by Crazy Love Ministries,  The Case for Christ book by Lee Strobel, <a href=\"http://thebibleproject.com/\">TheBibleProject.com</a>, School of Biblical Evangelism by Ray Comfort, 10 Minute Bible Hour channel, Francis Chan&#39;s sermon videos and writings, Matthew Henry&#39;s Commentary of the Bible (free at biblegateway.com), <a href=\"http://doesgodexist.com/\">doesgodexist.com</a> (dated site, good info by atheist/scientist).

The soul.\r<br>Just like the sperm came from somewhere in chain of transmitted genetic code (father &gt; son), the soul also must come from somewhere. Just like hardware and software are not one thing. Hardware is the mean through which logic can operate.\r<br>\r<br>Now as we have established the independence of the soul&#39;s origin we can confidently say that after death it must go somewhere : \r<br>  - creation of the human body.\r<br>  - birth : introduction of the soul.\r<br>  - life : body is decaying.\r<br>  - death : soul leaving the body.\r<br>\r<br>If you conduct an experiment on all the humans you will see that no one likes the idea of no life after death.

They are in essence believes. They have no evidence to support their claims, they have not been tested and retested through experiments, observations and the &quot;ideas&quot;, the &quot;philosophies&quot;, the &quot;beliefs&quot; that people hold in these matters are not inferences from observations but purely beliefs held without any scientific weight behind it. \r<br>Let us take them one by one:\r<br>Nihilism: Idea: &quot;the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless.&quot; The hypothesis that life is meaningless would be true \r<br>1. If there would be no soul.\r<br>2. There would be no permanent instance of you and your actions in the cosmos.\r<br>For 1. But there is no experiment to test if there is actually no soul. I do mean to say that no matter what experiment you do with the brain, you are really not testing the research question whether there is a soul or not. It is assessing brain functions. It is not assessing if there is something behind the said actions.\r<br>This can be however claimed that the existence of souls is unfalsifiable and therefore can not be known, therefore &quot;unscientific&quot;,&quot;wrong&quot;,&quot;woo woo&quot;,&quot;pseudoscience&quot;. \r<br>However, the claim that there is something beyond our observable universe is also unfalsifiable, in a way that we can not observe it with our known physics. We can not &quot;unprove&quot; its existence. But is that idea too &quot;unscientific&quot;,&quot;wrong&quot;,&quot;woo woo&quot;,&quot;pseudoscience&quot;?\r<br>Now, look at the dark flow. It does indicate that the movement of the superclusters affected by it had been under influence of something huge&#39;s gravitational pull. <br>Anyway, whatever it was is now beyond the observable universe, and therefore may still exist there, if again our known laws of physics continue to apply(unless we are very special great apes, which I think we are not, and the observable universe boundary is just a limit we imposed as we can not see past it by known law of physics.)\r<br>So in a nutshell, even though the whole matter that whether there is something beyond the observable universe remains beyond the scope of observation and therefore can not be falsified by the way of going to a place and observing, the unfalsifiable claim can have evidence in favor of it. Or in other words, this can be proven.\r<br>\r<br>Similarly, if in future we do discover scientifically that we have a soul, it would not require any more unfalsifiablility and things and would be a scientific fact. \r<br>\r<br>Therefore the Nihilism that life has no meaning is based on a belief that makes an assumption about something that can not be disproven. It would be scientific if it held a belief that can be disproven, like, say earth is round.(let flat earther comments commence). You can test the fact, and even go into space to see for yourself. Maybe make this easier, if the assumption was &quot; a ball is spherical&quot;. You can observe that. A falsifiable idea to go against would be &quot; a ball is like a  3D cube with only six sides&quot;. You can scientifically come to a conclusion about it, but not about: &quot;This ball was a square before and transformed without any trace of it&quot; (No time travel or records of the same allowed).\r<br>\r<br>Coming to 2, \r<br>In the entirely of cosmos with its apparent 3 spatial and one temporal dimensions, every particle and everything in the universe as a whole set from its inception and stretched limitlessly into the infinity, would have your entire being, your particles and your actions and everything.\r<br>Now, as a set of these dimensions and every occurrence within it, all your doings have been a part of it. Whatever you have done, KEEPS EXISTING in the past. Your present is only your viewpoint and again unless you consider yourself to be a special great ape, it does not matter what your view of present are. Your actions, your achievements and your failings are etched in the cosmos for eternity, as you act them out. Just because you can not go backwards in time does not make it any different. We do not make any silly assumptions that the world behind us as we walk, cease to exist, do we? So yes, your actions still count as it is.\r<br>\r<br>And yes, the answer is 42, so meaning of life is not actually &quot;null&quot;.", "comment_date": "2019-04-23T02:59:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theparijat1000", "comment_text": "Coming to atheism; The same as Nihilism other than the fact they are mostly about God than the individual Soul, and it is more specifically about the Abrahamic God. The chief issue about them is that many of them read too much of bible for their own good, and they do it to rebut it. They mostly deny the bible and such, and think that is enough. \r<br>But really, the idea that a God beyond space and time as we know it, is again unfalsifiable. But it again may not be something entirely impossible. It can exist without any trace to the humans, and it is also possible in the future to find evidence for the same. If for example someday angels come down singing choirs and all, or you die and find it to be true, you would find your evidence. \r<br>Or maybe when the stars would be right and the ancient city of.....well you get the idea.\r<br>\r<br>Coming to the opposite camp we have the theists of belief. They again have the unscientific belief that there is a God and it is abrahamic one. This one however is honest that they call it a belief or faith, so they are at least more scientific than others, that they dont claim that what they belief is based on science. It is not, and they neither claim it is.\r<br>However, their stand on this is more practical. You were born in this world, and you are presented with two worldviews, one is that there is a real danger of not believing in this thing, and the other that says it does not matter. Now, by common sense it is safer to avoid the danger since if the other camp is true then it still does not matter. It is not that atheists would be treated any differently in their version of what things would be like! But sure as HELL it would be different if they are wrong! \r<br>So, neither are less smart or anything. Chirstians are playing it safe, and not taking chances; while atheists are questionably feeling more liberated and taking risks. Some are gaming the system by remaining atheists all the life and near the end taking up christianity and confessing and ending the risk near the end of life. It does not matter much anyway when you are almost bedbound, does it?\r<br>\r<br>Now coming to the last one: AGNOSTIC: &quot;a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God.&quot;(Taken from google like previous ones.)\r<br> About the nothing can be known part, is not very scientific. If there is nothing known about the God, then there is essentially no information about it! If there is essentially no information about it, Wherefrom This Information About It Comes That Nothing Can Be Known About It?\r<br>If some substance has a quality that nothing about it can not be known, never ever, impossible, then it is a quality about it. Therefore both ideas are different and mutually incompatible, either nothing IS known, or nothing CAN be known. Both can not be true. However, IF nothing is known, then there is a possibility that God does exist. And IF nothing can be known about it is  taken as the face of agnosticism, then I am sorry to say that is still not scientific since that belief is taken without doing the proper methods. To come to that conclusion scientifically, one has to first attempt to know about God in every possible way. However, the problem is by definition the God can not be known in the Agnostic view, therefore how to know about it has no clear definition either, and even a single test that proved the hypothesis can not be deviced as we do not know what to test for. Therefore the idea that &quot;God can not be known&quot; is also a belief, same as &quot;nothing is known about God&quot; since that would require you to have all the information that is avaialable in the universe , also including the future.Unless these are done, the beliefs of the religions of atheism, agnosticism, abrahamic theists, and the belief of nihilism are just beliefs and nothing else. They are not scientific facts that are tried and tested and replicated, and they must not be taken that way. Agnostics can come a bit closer to the real position by saying &quot;According to how much information I have, there is no information widely known about God yet.&quot; or &quot;Maybe nothing is known about God, yet.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>If we are able to simulate the universe realistically in future, and more universes within it , then most of the universes in existence would be such simulations. This could also be that we could initially all be totally different from what we seem to be. This can also mean if there is a deeper layer version of yourself that is enjoying the simulation( or sucking at it like a total N00b), it would not perish alongside your simulation just like you dont die with a game, but retain the memories of the games. As a side note, if you are in a simulation, chances are that there are missions and quests and sidequests for you, and therefore life is not meaningless. Also as a sidenote, your doings and antics can also be preserved as a record and kept for the lolz.\r<br>\r<br>Assuming much that nothing matters at death, and enjoying the life carefree can be liberating and I wish you all the well for it if it does work, however, always remember that it is only as good as the average christian who believes the bible and lives by it, as both are assumptions, beliefs, and are only as helpful as to make one function better. If you do want to stick to the &quot;truth&quot; however, you must let yourself know that you Do not Really Know, what is going on, and neither know if it is possible to know or not. Be truly free and let go the need to be high and mighty, and be truthful to yourself. This is the truest admission you can make, as you are answering now something that only  you know. You must be knowing the extent of your knowledge, and that is the basis of your statement that does not force you to make a choice, to form an idea about something you have no idea of.  Rebel against the idea that one must have a belief or opinion about something  that you do not have adequate( or any) knowledge of. There is no need for you to assume that life has no meaning. Admit, that you do not know if life has a meaning and neither know if it is knowable or not. That idea would not force you to admit falsely that you know, and this idea would not ask you to believe it. It would not be a belief, but a conviction, since you only know for sure how much you do not  know at present. \r<br>\r<br>That, would be scientific, at least to yourself. Others may think at best you are lying, but that can be  somewhat prevented by improved polygraphs and other lie detectors.\r<br>Therefore, this is the only scientific, and most liberating ideology, that is to not give in to the societies expectation towards you to form an idea about something you do not know about. Embrace not knowing. A baby in England does not need to form an opinion about Brazilian economic model whether it works or sucks.

This allows anyone to do anything for example murder, without consequence.

I sometimes wish I could cast off some things I believe to to be true. Basically, where I&#39;m at right now, I&#39;m casting heads in Pascal&#39;s Wager (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager)</a>.

The God I believe in doesn&#39;t whip out The Smiting Rod\u2122 and smite anyone that says they do not believe in Him, or send them to hell when they die. That sort of God is an asshole. You are a person that is doing his level best to make the world a better place through science and education. That is the sort of thing that greatly pleases the God in whom I believe. You may not believe in Him now (or ever in all your human life), but that&#39;s ok. You&#39;re actively making the world a better place. God can (and in my opinion already has) set aside a mansion in Heaven for people like you. You may not believe now, but that doesn&#39;t matter. Once you get to the other side, you&#39;ll see that He Is; and you can accept him or reject Him then.<br><br>FWIW, I&#39;m with all you Atheists that think lots of religious people are nuts. The nutjobs that scream about people getting abortions are all going to hell and stuff, those whackjobs are a problem. I attend my weekly services and shake my head at all the groupthink.

The outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what you set out to to, to achieve this or that, which, of course, implies future. But if your destination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up so much of your attention that they become more important to you than the step you are taking now, then you completely miss the journey&#39;s inner purpose, which has nothing to do with /where/ you are going or /what/ you are doing, but everything to do with /how/. It has nothing to do with future but everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this moment. ... After that [realizing your inner purpose], the outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy it. It is also possible to fail completely in your outer purpose and at the same time totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or the other way around, which is actually more common: outer riches and inner poverty, or to &quot;gain the world and lose your soul,&quot; as Jesus puts it.

The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better.

Derek, even &quot;big new projects\u201d that you are \u201cexcited to share,\u201d as well as every memory of you, will eventually cease to exist. Relationships, too--all headed for the dustbin. What does it accomplish to get \u201cexcited\u201d over anything, if eventually the feeling dies, and finally even the memory of the feeling? And if I am wrong to say so, on what logical basis, given your thesis, do you have to refute me? In your universe, nothing matters, not even truth. If there is no upward force on a projectile in flight, what difference does it make, ultimately, to creatures with no future? <br><br>No, Derek, this persistent &quot;delusion,&quot; as you call it, is none other than your spirit whispering &quot;there&#39;s more.&quot; The same could be said for the imprint of morality on the hearts of all of mankind. The &quot;conscience&quot; is more than an evolutionary adaptation. It\u2019s a connection to another realm. You are dealing with the &quot;God-shaped vacuum&quot; inside every man. It&#39;s not a delusion. Belief in an existence beyond that which we can see is ubiquitous in humans, as well as reasonable. But something does not have to be obvious to be real. We believe in invisible things all the time, in things like air, or in things not in the present, like yesterday and tomorrow. It just takes a little more imagination and work. <br><br>The Nihilism of which you spoke, it is the anesthetic of those who have no reason for hope. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s illogical. What point is there to savoring \u201cthe now,\u201d much less telling others to do so, if neither of you have a tomorrow? It makes perfect sense how eating, drinking, and &quot;being merry,&quot; sex, and drugs, might interest a true nihilist. What does not follow is why you, an apparently congenial type of guy, would go to the effort of pushing a gospel that offers no hope, as this video tries to do.  If the proverbial plane is going to crash, and you can&#39;t stop it, why spend the trip down making sure everyone knows that they will be wiped out? <br><br>But is it as bad as all of that? Some time ago, into this dark, hopeless human experience, a light was dropped. Jesus.  (It\u2019s OK to roll your eyes, but keep reading.) The pivotal moment in all history.  IF Jesus rose from the dead, there IS hope of life after death.  That\u2019s what he claimed.  Is there any chance he was right? <br><br>And so I ask you\u2026Have you seriously investigated the evidences of his life, death, and resurrection? You won&#39;t be able to get him into your laboratory, but there are evidences that the biblical story is true.  As far as I know, there is no other religion or philosophy which offers the happy union of truth, hope, and love, all in the same package.  Some offer hope and love, but no truth. Some, like you, Derek, offer &quot;truth,\u201d as you see it, and possibly love, but no hope. <br><br>The fact that Christianity offers all three, does not in itself, make it so, of course. I&#39;m not saying to just believe something just because you want it to be so. But what I am saying is, given the fact that there&#39;s a big &quot;what the hell&quot; about EVERYTHING in a nihilist belief system anyway, why not spend some time sincerely investigating whether or not there is a credible case for the resurrection of Jesus from the dead? Ultimately, there&#39;s nothing to lose but time if it turns out to be a blind alley, and even that time is of little consequence if nihilism is valid. On the other hand, you might find, at the end of your search that EVERYTHING has meaning and consequence, that God is the grand unifying theme of all of existence, the physical and the spiritual. Why do all humans have an innate longing to know what is true, if knowing that truth does not benefit them? Why that deep instinct? What if we CAN live forever? Is that thought so profound, that a physicist like yourself could not think it? <br><br>Having said all of that, there is a flaw that exists in the mind of even the deepest of men, and it makes otherwise intelligent men stupid. Pride. We see it best in others. \u201cI am my own captain. I know best. I don\u2019t need help.\u201d It&#39;s humiliating and degrading, it seems, and certainly not popular, to believe in, take orders from\u2026 even fear, an invisible God. What would people say? How foolish I would look. <br><br>But what if there is a God? And what if the God that created matter and energy to follow unerringly what we call the &quot;laws of physics,&quot; topped all of that with the construction of a creature in his own image, capable of free choice, not as the billiard balls on the table.  Then, the physical universe is merely the background for the main event\u2014beings capable of loving of their own volition, actually the only way love can exist. Is that not a noble place in the universe for humans, and one worth celebrating? Unlike the planets, we can CHOOSE to &quot;orbit.&quot;  Unlike the rocks, we will remain. <br><br>Please think about it, Derek.<br><br>P.S.

(We all know that consciousness is real, and for such reasons which are covered in this little rant.) Consciousness in not physical, and cannot be. The body is made up of matter, and we don&#39;t ascribe consciousness to matter. Consciousness is not matter, it is not even a byproduct of matter. Consciousness is what likes or  does not like what is perceived by the body. The consciousness uses human bodies (animal bodies too) for the purpose of experiencing this universe. Somehow, the consciousness can perceive &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot; via the nervous system. Consciousness must, necessarily, be real, and must actually exist, in the immortal sense of the word, to be able to actually &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;like&quot; or &quot;dislike&quot; what the nervous system provides to it as sensation. Anything that actually exists must exist and must always exist -- things cannot exist and then not exist. Maybe consciousness is part of the atoms that join to make molecules that organize to make cells, that organize to make bodies . . . haven&#39;t worked that one out yet. Atoms, or &quot;energy,&quot; is real, and immortal too. There may be some connection between the two. But material objects, like the computer I am using, or any material thing, is not capable of being &quot;conscious&quot; in and of itself (e.g. artificial intelligence is not &quot;consciousness,&quot; and cannot be consciousness). And we may note that the computer is not immortal in any way, as it is a physical object and will be reduced to small particles, its elements, at some distant future date. Anyway, consciousness must necessarily exist separate from the material objects of the universe, and it is only animal bodies that can perceive the universe in such a way that they can be accessed by consciousness to serve as a window into the universe. I dare say that it looks very much like consciousness had some influence over the way the animal bodies were formed from atoms, molecules, and cells, so that the animal bodies that formed would provide consciousness with the sensation input that consciousness wanted.

There are a few simple cold truths about life. None of them indicate a value judgment upon it. Life contains pain. (Not &quot;life IS pain&quot; as some suggest.) Nothing lasts forever. We all are born, grow up, get sick, grow old, and die. All of these can bring us pain. Interestingly at the very beginning this person&#39;s analysis sounds very, very much like Buddhism or how the Buddha would have approached. Much as this guy went to the broken down town of Pripyat, the Buddha, 2500 years ago went away from his pleasure-addled rich man&#39;s castle out in the world and saw his own cold reminders. People crippled by age, by disease. Dead bodies. Agony. The harsh truths of life. Indeed Buddha would come even to claim things like that, that there is no permanent ego, actually that there is no ego at all. (There were said to be two views, one that there was a permanent ego and another that there was an ego that died, and Buddha said there isn&#39;t one to begin with.) There&#39;s just things like, what we would now recognize as thoughts, impulses in our brains, matter, body and brains, but no ego to be found in any of these items, or in anything else for that matter.<br><br>Buddha also said we can be free of pain by changing our minds -- to avoid that which is wrongful and seek that which is good meaning beneficial to all people and even all other forms of life (at least those that can feel pain themselves), both ourselves <i>and</i> others in equal measure, cultivating moral goodness and a just means to a livelihood, and letting go of excessive, unquenchable desire and egoism as well as refining and focusing our thought processes. Not necessarily free as in that, e.g. a hurt thumb won&#39;t hurt (but maybe it may keep us from hurting it in the first place!) but that psychologically, we will not be moved to that which is not good for us any more and to be able to accept things for what they are without trouble, and for others to be made better though it. Life may contain pain but it doesn&#39;t have to be <i>about</i> pain and it doesn&#39;t have to leave us always wanting more <i>even if we can&#39;t actually </i><b><i>get</i></b><i> more</i> (and that is why I say it&#39;s better.).<br><br>It is interesting to note that given Buddhist texts, they are not necessarily perfect records of what Buddha actually taught, perhaps subjected to further additions since his time, and regarding death and &quot;afterlives&quot; if any specifically, there seems to be some disagreement in them. In some cases it is claimed that Buddha said that there is a type of rebirth, in others to have said that it cannot be answered and still others that to cling to any theories about it just brings pain or, at least, should not concern one. It is also said though that Buddha would have taught to what would be needed for people to accept his teaching, so it is possible that for some he worked with the existing concepts of rebirth at the time and for others he had to disavow them. Not to upset the cart in some but definitely in others.<br><br>(And certainly while one could see how someone whose life is going good may wish for there to be more, I could also equally just as much see how someone depressed or in endless agony could wish for the opposite and wish for just that: the sweet release of oblivion. Depressed, they have no hope for heaven. At least with oblivion, there is no more sadness. And Buddha then is said at some times to have said also that longing for non-existence is just as unhelpful and bad as longing for continued existence.)<br><br>(It&#39;s even interesting, noting this video author&#39;s example of rocks, to note that Buddha also was said to, rather intriguingly presciently although maybe just a lucky guess, have foreseen the end of even the Earth and used that at one point to make a point about the impermanence of things, to show that even the seemingly most-permanent thing ever, the Earth itself, was also not so. And the descriptions he gave sound remarkably like a poetic way of describing the result of the continued evolution of the Sun into a red giant and its final death. He used the image of &quot;seven suns&quot;, that there would come a time when two, three, four, and eventually up to seven suns would rise, each one adding heat and evaporating the water from the planet, eventually causing the rock to start to outgas and then finally be incinerated and be consumed until nothing at all remained. One could easily imagine this as seven phases of the further evolution of the Sun, each one hotter and more destructive than the previous. It&#39;s not entirely perfect but in any case it is probably the most accurate description of the end of the Earth that I&#39;ve ever seen in any canon of antiquity.)<br><br>The place where the guy in this video doesn&#39;t quite make the last cut is the end. For one, not all of us are born with the genetic wherewithal to achieve that which is &quot;great&quot;. And even those that do, it too will eventually be forgotten. Such is the universal, all-pervading nature of impermanence. The whole human race&#39;s time is limited, the Earth will vanish (as Gautama Siddhartha the Buddha already realized all that time ago in such remarkable detail). The universe itself, will grow cold, empty, and dark. Even if as some theories suggest a new universe will be born to succeed it, no one that comes to be in that universe will have any knowledge of the one which preceded it. And errors won&#39;t necessarily be forgotten even for the limited time (cosmically) they are remembered for. MLK Jr. cheated a wife, Malcolm X did some theft. These errors are remembered just as much as their glory. Errors are not forgotten nor are glories; rather we are remembered for exactly the flawed humans we always are. Even our mythological heroes have tragic flaws.<br><br>And that as mentioned elsewhere belief in nothing can also be used as an excuse to do something bad. The same idea of being &quot;not cautious&quot; can be taken further. Maybe I can try to do something morally taboo, something evil, dishonest, foul. If I can outsmart and cover it up successfully, then I will die and not have to regret it after that point for I won&#39;t exist anymore. Nor will any victim eventually. And I can rationalize it away. Yet simultaneously so can the belief in something continued, e.g. if I believe God will forgive all afterward, then I get to Heaven either way, and so can also do an evil (even better, if I believe God sanctioned it, e.g. ISIS, al Qaeda, or going back further in history the Crusaders and the colonial genocidists of the Age of Genocide.). In other words, belief or non-belief in afterlives, I believe, is less important than how much we really hold on to what is right. At the same time, a belief in something could be used just same, to allow us to be bold as well: if there is something I need not fear losing even if my effort results in my own death. So let&#39;s go and take a risk.<br><br>(And from my own experience, as someone who cannot make up their mind about afterlives, if they exist or not or what, I&#39;ve seen both ends, when feeling down or bad how I could wish either for nothing and thus won&#39;t have to deal with it ever, or if I feel maybe I did wrong that I might then wonder well what if there is an afterlife and I&#39;ll be held to account so maybe I should try and put it right, or how that when I feel energized to do something good, that it would be even better if I could have the opportunity to see the continued results of that good in an afterlife, so that my curiosity will be satisfied. Or then I think that there is nothing, and then also be motivated in that way perhaps like as this guy says, because I&#39;ll want the good done so at least it gets done before the nothing.)<br><br>In other words, to me the afterlife thing, and consequences of such beliefs, can be argued both ways (and perhaps that is why the Buddha was not of one mind about it and why in some places he suggested that it should not be attended to and maybe that&#39;s the answer to the confusion) in both cases. In any case though, there is one thing we can be sure of, <i>afterlife or not</i> : that the time in which we, as us now (even if you accept a reincarnation, you get born as someone else right? Fresh memory and whole new stuff.), have an opportunity to affect the world for good in a direct fashion, is limited. Even if we go to heaven or hell, once we&#39;re there we won&#39;t be able to do whatever we wanted to here. So why not <i>do good for someone else now</i> ? I guess though that&#39;s the conclusion at the end of the video as well (although the visual hints suggest toward a kind of class-privileged idea of &quot;what you should do&quot; which is wrong and doesn&#39;t focus on the more collectivistic style of thought which is in many ways more just because we can always try to do something for other people in whatever capacities we are given and find reward in that, even if we can&#39;t go climb 60 tall mountains due to lack of $ or invent the greatest invention ever due to lack of intellectual giftedness.). But the funny part is, it doesn&#39;t really depend on whether you believe that there is things after death or not; because of the fact I mentioned above, that whether there is or isn&#39;t, the fact is you die and thus are removed from the position you were in where you could do that, whether to go off to a heaven or hell, or to be reincarnated as someone who in important ways really isn&#39;t &quot;you&quot; anymore (won&#39;t have the same wants, needs, outlook, or whatever), or simply end up as nothing.", "comment_date": "2017-04-21T02:49:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Zaberca", "comment_text": "Damn, you didn&#39;t have to hit this deep.", "comment_date": "2017-04-20T13:26:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FeroxCious", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty sure that spending 2 weeks in Pripyat is pretty similar to 2 weeks in an average Russian town.", "comment_date": "2017-04-20T04:22:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moangus PIckard", "comment_text": "religion and nihlism can both be good if used correctly. dont blame either", "comment_date": "2017-04-19T13:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abin Mathew Abraham", "comment_text": "the background score is spooky", "comment_date": "2017-04-19T10:49:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sali mall", "comment_text": "I wrote this so many times now , so I will be repeating myself: we were all dead before we were borne .

Nihilism is warm.  I&#39;m not a nihilist just because it&#39;s warm.  I&#39;m a nihilist because I rationalized my way to it.<br><br>Sometime around 2004 or 2005, I was at my girlfriend&#39;s house.  I was in the bathroom urinating and had just finished when I suddenly passed out.  I went to the hospital afterward and had a some follow-up tests run over the next couple of weeks, but I was fine.  It was a one-time thing for which I may never know the cause and which may never happen again.  When it happened, it was instantaneous.  In one moment, I was fully awake and conscious.  In the next moment, I was waking up on the bathroom floor from what felt like the best goddamn sleep I have ever had.  I recall a distant thud from when the back of my head hit the bathroom door, and I remember distant voices from the next room as consciousness was slowly coming back.  I was out for no more than five seconds, but it felt like an eternity of sleep.  After I was back at full consciousness, the feeling of restfulness wore off, and I had a mild feeling of nausea that passed quickly.  It was an interesting experience, and it wasn&#39;t unpleasant overall.  It was like my light switch being flicked off and then back on.  The off was immediate, but the on was like one of those light bulbs that slowly brightens over time until it&#39;s at full power.  When death occurs instantly, the flicking off of the light switch is what I imagine it would be like.", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T17:01:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William McCormick", "comment_text": "When people give up on the soul, and God. There is really no reason to be human, you are just a computer program running, there would be no reason to be nice or good. There would be no reason not to enslave your neighbor to make your program more enjoyable. If a program could figure out enjoyment? A program cannot figure out what it would enjoy. <br><br>Then we look at the brave acts men have done in history and we get that warm feeling, maybe a proud tear of joy, that perhaps we could be like that, maybe in that situation we would have done the same thing, it would be so right so easy. <br><br>So if you are just a program already written and compiled, why worry about time? There is nothing you can do about it, the programmer has already set your destiny. A program does not feel, a program has no wants, desires, or needs.

The greatest scientists on earth that found the secrets you are in search of, were all of the belief there is a higher power. Because the secrets of the universe were right in front of them, but they were not good enough, brave enough and did not have enough love of their neighbors to see them, much less wield those truths. Until they truly found God and his laws of science and the universe. They are fantastically simple yet offer infinite opportunity. <br><br>What could be the force, the feeling that we had better do the right thing, that which we would have done to ourselves?

My days are finite and so I should get out and live. But the very thing that you say frees you from fear will make whatever you do between then and now equally meaningless. When I enter that great nothing you speak of I will not regret anything. A person could just as easily look at that and say why bother doing anything? Why leave my home? Or, why worry about longevity? Maybe I should eat what I want, do what I want, do all the drugs I want, commit any crime I can get away with and then drift off into nothing after death, none of it having any meaning and never having to worry about any of it. Anyone I hurt, well they&#39;ll die too, and so will anyone that cares what I did to them. Maybe I&#39;ll get away with it and not have to worry about it, but if I don&#39;t, who cares. Sure, life will be less enjoyable behind bars, but whether I enjoy it or not, the same great nothing awaits us all and blots out everything we ever did. We speak grandly about travelling, seeing the world, interacting with cultures, bettering ourselves, continually learning when our brains our just hard drives being filled for the sole purpose of wiping them. <br><br>You were talking about great achievements being left behind, but you also spoke of not caring, because you have to be there to care. Even people who claim to be nihilists assume that they will have some capacity to care about what they have left behind. Or at least they speak like they do. But if you&#39;re right, you won&#39;t. You might have cured cancer. Makes no difference. And not just to you, but to anyone or anything because eventually, it will all die. All people. All planets. All stars. All dead and no one to remember or care about anything anyone ever did. It will be as though none of it ever happened. There is a comment below suggesting that this is why religion is so easy to sell, because it offers eternal life and that&#39;s what people want. But in fact what people want is to not be held responsible. It is a far easier sell to tell people that nothing they do matters because it will all be erased in the end. <br><br>Christianity on the other hand says everything you do matters. Every word you speak, every thought you have will echo into eternity and that we will answer for all of it. You said that being able to picture the vast nothing that awaits sets you free from fear because it will all be erased. Fine. Picture instead that there is no vast nothing. Instead you wind up in the presence of the only perfect being who ever existed or ever will exist. The being so powerful that he created the universe that you imagined collapsing in on itself and leaving nothing behind. And that being then summons you and puts you to judgement, reminding you of everything you&#39;ve ever done. So rather than your embarrassments and humiliations dissipating into the void they are placed in front of you, along with every evil you&#39;ve ever committed, things you&#39;ve long since forgotten but now you remember very clearly. And you realize, standing before perfecting that you&#39;ve never done anything good. Even what you thought was good seems despicable now. This is not an easy sell. <br><br>You say that Nihilism tells you to get out and lead the life you want to lead today because your days are finite. But you&#39;ll be living a life that&#39;s best for you. Even when you help people it will be because it makes you feel good to do it. What other reason does Nihilism offer? Christianity on the other hand says that you are eternal and that this life is a vapour. We should live this life sacrificially, concerned more about others than about ourselves.

The truth about Dharma and duty is hid in the cave of our hearts, therefore that alone is the path along which the great have trod. This world full of ignorance is like a pan.

I think you have drawn logical conclusions, but I am sure that they are completely wrong. :) I&#39;ll elaborate.<br><br>Records about as ancient as the human species itself and experiences of millions of people even today show that we are actually hardwired to experience nothingness. The experience is usually not described as non-existence, but as eternal, undifferentiated <b>pure</b> existence (no specific objects but the pure potentiality of all existences). This connects to unified field theories of theoretical physics. It&#39;s an experience of pure abstraction, but the experience of nothingness itself is concrete nonetheless (otherwise it wouldn&#39;t have been recorded throughout history).<br><br>Research has shown that there is a unique 4th state of consciousness that is called transcendental consciousness, the experience of which would accurately be described as nothingness, completely without any notion of space and time. It&#39;s pure awareness without an object of perception besides itself -- self-referential awareness. <br>It is characterized by a combination of low arousal and high attention (the reverse of what is typically seen), also called a state of restful alertness. It&#39;s a state where the mind is completely unperturbed, completely in rest, yet alert and wakeful within itself. <br>During the experience of this 4th state, global EEG coherence is measured -- i.e. synchronized functioning in the entire brain -- indicating more orderly and integrated functioning, which has been correlated with peak performance in top athletes and entrepeneurs. No other experience is known to produce brainwave coherence at this scale.<br><br>The nuance here is that nothingness is <b>directly</b> experienced in pure consciousness, not through sensory perception. It is experienced by directing the attention inward instead of outward (through the senses), and this can be done reliably in a systematic and spontaneous way, not involving imagination or suggestion or any sort of control of the mind. In my opinion this shows that we are hardwired for the experience.<br>The only reason why most people have not experienced it is that they don&#39;t know of a way to turn the attention within without effort, which is essential because effort keeps the mind active on superficial levels of consciousness. Transcendental Meditation is the only method I know that offers a reliable effortless technique to provide the experience of pure consciousness, completely regardless of a person&#39;s tendencies.", "comment_date": "2016-11-06T21:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "p3rryksy", "comment_text": "you are enlightened.", "comment_date": "2016-11-06T13:46:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N.

There are a of people that believe that people are made up of a physical body and a nonphysical soul or spirit. There are many different religions or spiritual ideas that mirror this. The soul/spirit is neither created nor destroyed (reincarnation), it&#39;s created but then destroyed (concept of no afterlife or nothingness), or it&#39;s created but then exists forever in one state or another (such as in heaven or hell, or purgatory, or limbo, etc.). Everyone has an idea about what is after death. But only one idea, or perhaps no ideas, even have a chance of being correct. It&#39;s part of being human.<br><br>And btw the only thing that keeps people from achieving their dreams is fear and laziness, anything else is an excuse. A distant horizon doesn&#39;t encourage you to play it safe, it encourages you to sit back and be lazy. A lot of people use religious philosophy as an excuse for being lazy, but that&#39;s all it is, an excuse, not a reason. Remember, people&#39;s belief that their soul/spirit lives forever doesn&#39;t just mean you always live with your failures because that happens anyways, it also means they believe you will always live with your successes. So logically you should try and do the best that you can in the time that you have. Excuses can always be made into motivations.<br><br>But then again, this is your video not mine.<br><br>On a side note, I think nihilism is stupid. Everything is meaningless? Meaning is a concept of value, and by definition value is a comparison. In order for something to be meaningless there would have to be nothing to compare it to, so it would either need to be completely solitary or it would need to not exist. So in a sense the only thing that is meaningless is nothing, or one thing surrounded by nothing.  If you want to be really technical, the only reason nihilism has any meaning to people is because another previously held ideology those people had didn&#39;t work out for them. After all, one ideology would have no value if there weren&#39;t other ideologies to compare it to. Ergo nihilism is stupid; it just isn&#39;t meaningless. To me it doesn&#39;t matter what ideas you think of to get you somewhere it only matter what you get done, and if nihilism is what gets you to do things more power to you, but not everyone works that way.<br><br>I do get where your coming from though, so please don&#39;t take this as me calling you stupid, I just think the idea of it is.

Not because I&#39;m trapped in some baseless idea that I am immortal in some way or other, but because that is simply impossible to accurately imagine.

Some never look beyond our bodies as the source of our soul. We always think about the inside, when the inside is nothing more then the receiver of our souls communications. Our DNA is nothing more then an antenna to receive the communications our souls emit. We are not inside but outside our bodies. The best analogy would be the computer hooked to the internet. Not some comparison to a lifeless rock. There are a great many things we can learn through that internet with our receiving DNA antenna. Doing for the sake of doing is not a way to learn or grow. Doing for a job or some other meaningless activity only teaches one thing. Bottom feeders will always feed from the bottom and never rise to the greatness we are going to become. Living a good life filled with love with plenty of opportunity to learn is the key to unlocking our true potential and freeing our souls to the true meaning of life, Growth! Doing for the sake of doing is counter productive to our true calling. Learning about oneself is better then &quot;Just do it&quot; mentality. Love is the key.

Some of your thoughts didn&#39;t seem consistent even though they were expressed in a very eloquent way. You reduce our existence to that of rocks in order to claim that we are not permanent (rocks don&#39;t last, why would we?) This all works out if you ascribe to a naturalistic worldview, but that ultimately is a philosophical choice you have made. A statement that lacks coherence with a naturalistic worldview is this idea that we are hardwired with a goal to self-replicate. You observe things surviving and replicating, but why conclude that &quot;nature&quot; in almost a sentient way has this goal of copying itself? You have jumped from an observation of how things work mechanically and now assigned a purpose statement to that observation. On what authority do you stand to make that conclusion? Some probably say &quot;common sense&quot;, but what is the naturalistic/mechanical explanation for such a phenomenon as that since many people in the world do not hold to a naturalistic worldview and the concept is not scientific? Your conclusion is that we are hardwired to ignore our impermanence and you then go on to explain how this hinders us from living a more meaningful life. What makes a life meaningful and why is a nihilist concerned about people living a life in a more meaningful way? That point around <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKR-HydGohQ&amp;t=6m17s\">6:17</a> if probably the biggest demonstration that you aren&#39;t living a life that demonstrates what you believe. Life is meaningless, yet you have created a YouTube channel that desires to share the truth with the world so that why??? who cares right??? Why is a nihilist concerned about living a &quot;fuller&quot; life?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here is my alternative to what you are saying. Human beings are constantly asking questions about life, death, and meaning because we have an innate sense that life is not meaningless. This is not for naturalistic reasons because many lifeforms get along just fine self-replicating without contemplating what we call &quot;life&#39;s big questions.&quot; You have already demonstrated that limiting yourself to naturalistic and sometimes reductionist thinking is not how we &quot;naturally&quot; operate. There is something beyond our own existence that gives us meaning. This is not a new thought obviously because there are many with a supernatural worldview of some sort. My worldview is founded on non-negotiable beliefs in Christianity (the beliefs that all Christians must hold to in order to be considered Christian). The Bible acknowledges our finite nature and how our time is short in the grand scheme of creation. What gives us meaning is not that we live forever, but that we can live in relationship with the one who created us.forever. That truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is what has driven many to seek fellowship, love, peace, the truth, and many other virtuous things that all people find important. Living in the hope and joy that comes from that reality is what drives me to write this to you. I&#39;m not here to bash you, condemn you, or judge you. I&#39;m here to say that there is a perspective on life more coherent and consistent with the reality we experience and that perspective comes from trusting in the truth revealed to the world through God by means of the Bible and Jesus Christ. I&#39;d love to actually have a conversation about this if you are ever interested.

People can only be fun for so long before they get dull. Pain and old age scare me, but death and dark humor make me happy. In the end, I still believe we should regard science far above philosophy and think about the unknown as if it&#39;s unknown as we try to be the best people we can be.

Dr. Edward Feser. &quot;The last superstition&quot;. 3. Dna specialist Dr. Stephen Meyer&#39;s book. &quot;Signature in the cell. <br><br>Here are some points to ponder<br>1. If we are nothing more than material, &quot;Molecules in motion&quot; What is the molecular structure to the law of mathematics? Or the molecular structure of logic? i.e. there are immaterial realities to the world that are not dependent on material for existing. Example, the law of noncontradition is true whether or not their is a mind to understand it. Two opposing arguments can never be true at the same time. Point; There is a mind behind the matter. If space, time, and material all had a beginning ( a cause), then what ever caused it has to be spaceless, timeless and immaterial.  Nothing did not create nothing. But what ever answer it could be has to be outside of the space, time and material universe. <br><br>2. If we are a product of a nondirectied evolutionary process formed by chance and subjected to our chemistry and molecules to determine how and why we think the way we do, how can any view let alone nihilism even be trusted.

The person perished, but it was so gradual that we didn&#39;t notice.<br><br>We say we fear death, yet we generally tolerate the sort of death brought by gradual change very well. We actually want to continue changing, evolving, even though in so doing - even if we live forever - the very act of changing would radically transform us again, and &#39;we&#39; - as we are right now, as we imagine ourselves, our current sense of awareness - would still disappear into the mists of time, and so we would &#39;die&#39; anyway.<br><br>So whether you exist or not depends very strongly on what you are defining as &#39;you&#39;. For me it is easier to imagine nothingness by imagining a single photon. A photon exists from our perspective, but it cannot from its own - so it is a sort of nothing. It cannot in any way have a sense of itself and if nothing were around to interact with it, I question whether we could say it exists at all. It is a thing that is only a thing insofar as it is observed. It cannot be a thing to itself because it experiences no time.<br><br>This also relates to the &#39;God&#39; paradox. Having an omniscient and omnipotent being - all-knowing, all-powerful - is a bit like having an infinite speed of light for the universe, where all parts of the universe can then interact with and &#39;know&#39; each other instantly. This inhibits discreteness and since it is its own alpha and omega, actually inhibits anything we would call consciousness at all. God would be exactly like the individual photon - since such a being would experience no time and could thus not exist in relation to anything else, it could have no awareness, no purpose and no consciousness. So it wouldn&#39;t be an awareness at all. God in this total sense is a logical impossibility. You can have a &#39;god&#39; that is fully aware of a system it is not bound by. Draw a flat &#39;universe&#39; on paper and decide how its constituents will move and you are &#39;god&#39; for that universe, but it is only possible insofar as you exist beyond that universe you created, in another one for which you are not and cannot be &#39;god&#39; - where you do not know everything - otherwise you would cease to be aware at all as you would be everything all at once and unable to interact with anything outside yourself, unable to &#39;change&#39; in relation to yourself over time.<br><br>So, amazingly, while we fear our mortality, it also seems that the awareness we so cherish is actually physically impossible without it - not just in this universe, but in any universe.", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T03:30:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruno Geise", "comment_text": "incredibly awesome thoughts!", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T00:35:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ta Be", "comment_text": "pretty smart stuff", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T22:26:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emilio Kolomenski", "comment_text": "I need to watch this more often.", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T21:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N3R0 ONFIREYO", "comment_text": "the whole universe in a room is a paradox because where would that &quot;room&quot; be?", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T20:44:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "charlidog2", "comment_text": "All the sudden I feel guilty watching youtube.", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T20:00:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "charlidog2", "comment_text": "God damn, that was a permanent marker used on his face.", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T19:59:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pragyan", "comment_text": "Why do people dislike this video?", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T14:03:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "lJ Draws", "comment_text": "Really inspirational video! ty", "comment_date": "2016-04-13T07:21:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel harman", "comment_text": "We do not experience nothingness when we die!!!!", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T23:20:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake Kutschke", "comment_text": "&quot;If you can really picture the nothingness that awaits you, what is there to be afraid of?&quot; My friend, it works both ways.

It&#39;s like a song, a story, a concept, a theme, a distinct essence that something carries. Like, when you see a painting, or hear a song, there&#39;s an ultimate essence that enters your reality. It is so pure, if you can truly appreciate it for what it is. It&#39;s a combination of colours that output a certain sense of dejavu... Because you are all that is, all that ever was, and all that ever will be. And deep down, you remember. But I&#39;m not here to make you feel like you&#39;re broken or need to change.

Though to say it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; concept to believe in the soul is kind of ironic. I thought it to be much safer and fearless ideal to be nothing afterwards. With a soul, you are transitioning in to something we forgot once before. A state that&#39;s alien once again. And are faced with infinite, but without our senses of the flesh. Nothingness is an easy escape, to deal with the afterlife is another state that would truly be overwhelming to all.<br><br>I think the concept that most believe is nothing, is the loss of self among the infinite existence. The very real possibility that through the many avenues of death, people do lose themselves due to the trauma of the kind of death they went through, and retreat from self back in to the mix of all things. Like safe, cozy bed, wrapped up and dreaming of things that can be, has been and will. Though I think it would make sense that some immediately remember they are still one of a whole. Retain bits and pieces, and eventually come back around. Not necessarily here, but maybe somewhere else, though it makes sense for most to be drawn back to the energy they are familiar with. Like reruns of a show we&#39;d rather watch, rather than new show that we have a feeling might be too far from our interests.<br><br>I&#39;ve had my own experiences with situations too hard to explain to others that haven&#39;t had near death experiences or had their own interesting encounters with the hard to speak about. But through my perception, I can say that I do believe in an infinite setting and for lack of a better term, we as energy have, and will be part of it forever. Whether you choose to be yourself or become a faceless member, that I genuinely believe is up to us. Nothingness, if it ever was, isn&#39;t anymore.

That our children\u2019s lives will fade?

This is an extension of the famous question; \u201cIf a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?\u201d With modern science we know that sound waves carry over long distances and their vibration percolates through the surrounding matter causing slight but very real friction and reactions. Yes, the tree does make a sound because its shockwave of \u2018noise\u2019 budged a single leaf 1mm, and that is measurable. Does a meteor crashing into a planet a billion light years from any living thing make an impact? Yes, even the slightest photon of light from the impact flies through the universe and delivers its energy elsewhere. Due to the infinite subtlety of the universe, the answer is always \u2018yes\u2019. That is, until you get to the larger picture. The largest picture. Without a conscious being to witness its passing, the scope of time is meaningless. A star\u2019s birth and death is instantaneous without something to put it in perspective. Like color, time only exists as it is perceived. You might say \u201cwell, this star lived 1 million years longer than this star, so we can compare their lifespan as a measurement of time\u201d, however without a single being to witness it (and present that argument), they never existed at all.<br><br>So, life does have meaning - without it, the universe isn\u2019t even a theory. If our little planet is the only life in the universe then the universe exists for us, because of us. Many believe that other life is probable in the universe. With the trillions of stars and galaxies, it seems absurdly probable that life bloomed elsewhere. However, how rare is \u2018intelligent life\u2019? How many years and how many species did it take to produce us? And we barely made it.

There are moral/ ethical nihilists, epistemological nihilists, ontological/ metaphysical nihilists, etc.  In each case, nihilism is the stance which rejects the validity of subject as a whole by claiming that there is no subject/ nothing being investigated.  So, moral nihilism is based upon the belief that there is NO morality to be studied, therefore ALL moral/ ethical systems are wrong (yes, this includes uber-libertarian ego-centrism as well); while epistemic nihilism rejects epistemology (the study/ theory of knowledge and what qualifies to be accurately described as knowledge) on the basis that knowledge does not exist; and metaphysical/ ontological nihilism goes so far as to be based on a rejection of the existence of existence itself. <br><br>What is mentioned in this video (an acceptance with one&#39;s own status as a temporal and temporary being, as opposed to the delusion of seeing oneself as, so some extent or another, eternal) neither rejects either the acceptance of or the rejection of this mental state, so it cannot, strictly speaking, be called nihilist/ nihilism.

I once believed in God and an afterlife, even creationism. The disillusionment that followed questioning and interrogating my beliefs in search of answers, led to an extreme disappointment with life and existence. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve managed to find catharsis in the void, but I&#39;ve been struggling to accept it, and still, I have hope in spite of the tendency toward disorder and oblivion. Though, I have not given up on such hopes, I dare not invest myself wholly in them. <br><br>If our days are truly numbered, as it would appear, with no meaning, purpose or infinite destiny, then I don&#39;t see that as a motivation to get up and accomplish anything at all. If my accomplishments are but castles in the sand, then to enjoy them and think it of any value is to be ignorant death and the void. Everything you do will waste away and no one will even be left to consider the value of your actions. So , in the long run, there&#39;s no value in action any more so than inaction. Distraction and hedonism are all that life is.<br><br>However, the assumption that values are contrived rather than derived is what gets me. To claim that value judgements have no real value is a value judgement against value judgements. Everything we understand is through processed sensory contrast (up vs down, dark vs light, hot vs cold, fast vs slow good vs bad) and that&#39;s where all value is derived. One could surmise that all values and experiences are like an abstract division of zero into positive and negative values, that our entire existence is simply a finite abstraction. But, one could just as reasonable assume that values are derived rather than contrived; that all of our hopes and all of our dreams, are more than material which decays with time. Perhaps we experience meaning because there&#39;s an infinite availability of it everywhere. I find the inspiration that comes from the idea of an infinite existence where consciousness journeys on forever is much greater than the meaningless void I&#39;ve started to slide into. <br><br>Thinking that existence itself is finite vs infinite also seems like an assumption. The singularity is said to have been infinite heat, density and mass. Doesn&#39;t sound so finite after all, for heat is molecular motion and time is a sequence of events, therefore it follows that infinite heat means that existence is infinite and something has always existed. What if origins do not exist? What if there&#39;s simply an infinite chain of cause and effect? To even logically suppose the universe ultimately came did not come from &quot;nothing&quot; is written off as being incorrect since logic itself is seen as dependent on the existence of the universe as it is now.

Below is what I have found to be true about the world, and I do not mean to offend anyone, only to help.</b><br><br>Those are, without a doubt, the most important realizations to come to at some point in your life. Too often we&#39;re lost in the ignorance of frantic lives and we dismiss them as unimportant . But their is NOTHING more important. <br><br>Still, I could never accept a life that has no intrinsic purpose or value other than that which we assign it, especially if we are left with complete, eternal emptiness. If I live my life to the fullest, taking full advantage of every opportunity to experience sensual pleasures and gratifying accomplishments, and if my final thoughts on my death bed are without any regret, then I am no better off. I may as well have lived a life in poverty if my eternal self will cease to exist, because any memories that would have defined the value of my time spent alive would simply be lost. So, what&#39;s the point?<br><br>The ugly truth is that noone lives in any state of peace. We are plagued with regret, fear, dissatisfaction, and ultimately emptiness, despite our very best efforts to fill our lives with all of the luxuries this world has to offer. There is always something missing, isn&#39;t there? Isn&#39;t that what drives us?<br><br>So, at the turning point in my life, my question was: why even bother with the pain of life only to get glimpses of bliss? I would have no eternal memory of either pain or bliss. And at that moment it all made sense.<br><br>There must be an afterlife. Whether or not there is an afterlife, I must believe in one if I&#39;m going to keep living, simply because it&#39;s the only thing that would give any substantial meaning to my life. Additionally, this afterlife must be determined by the way in which I live my life, with eternal consequences. Otherwise my actions on earth would be meaningless.<br><br>Suddenly, this sounded strikingly familiar to the doctrines of Abrahamic religions.<br><br>And that&#39;s how I became a Christian. Not because I was told to believe or even because I wanted to believe, but because I had to believe in order to stay alive. It was the only value I had left. But don&#39;t be fooled! On the surface, Christianity seems like a complex, fantastic fable that only serves to comfort us and give meaning to our otherwise puny lives, when in reality, it cuts to the core of everything.<br><br>Unlike other Abrahamic religions, such as Islam and Judaism, Christianity is not performance based. Contrarily our standing with God is based on His grace, poured into the world through His son, Jesus Christ, which is the only means in which we can attain God&#39;s moral standards. It&#39;s a beautiful thing!<br><br>Now, if Christianity worked on a merely intellectual level, it would be for nothing. The fact is (at least from my experience) that God produces changes in us through His spirit, and those changes bring us joy, peace and life. He also sets us free from the things we are bound to, for example, addictions. The truth is that I used to be very addicted to pornography (as many people are) to the point where it consumed my every thought. It was my master and I its slave. Despite my efforts to resist it I could not. So I gave it to God. I said &quot;If you want me to change, you&#39;ll have to change me. I can&#39;t do it.&quot; And the crazy thing is, He did.<br><br>Friends, let me tell you, there is nothing but disappointment and emptiness in this life. I believe in Jesus Christ because He has done a great work in me, and I can put my hope in Him. There is nothing on earth that is greater than a relationship with God, and He loves the world greatly. Don&#39;t be afraid to talk to Him and to ask Him for forgiveness, because there is no truer blessing than a life in Him.<br><br>Regardless of whether you agree, there is a big, scary universe out there. So I wish you every blessing in your pursuit of truth.<br><br>Thomas", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T23:49:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Capn Camden", "comment_text": "okay but what do the workers think????", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T22:37:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bamsemor777", "comment_text": "Our greatest delusion is that we dont know we are deluded.", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T22:32:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sepehr Zohoori Rad", "comment_text": "well, i WAS having a good day", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T11:03:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eva B", "comment_text": "This gave me a major existential crisis...", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T05:08:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arthur Debra", "comment_text": "Personally, I could not stand that life have a meaning.

I think there&#39;s very few people who are concerned with their bodies preserving. Presuming everyone else experiences consciousness as I do it&#39;s very hard to imagine it being 100% part of the body (or in my case at all). In my experience your emotions aren&#39;t you, they&#39;re like sensory inputs to the consciousness. Same with our sensory inputs to some degree but what my consciousness feels isn&#39;t the sensory inputs. It&#39;s what the body feels &quot;emotionally&quot;. When you touch something without much care tons of information is left out. When you then touch that same something with a different mindset you feel entirely different things emotionally and the experience is entirely different. Similarly when concerned with things we associate to the brain there&#39;s different levels of thought. There&#39;s thoughts where you don&#39;t feel anything from the body really. They&#39;re seemingly entirely separate from the body because they can be analytical when you feel silly or sad when you&#39;re happy. Same with multiple thoughts at once. They&#39;re not the same type of thoughts. It&#39;s like they&#39;re on different coordinate systems where different things matter, a thought can be concerned with immediate reality while another can be simply an observation and conclusion on things you&#39;ve remembered. But the results of those thoughts are still stored. These thoughts aren&#39;t always simultaneously conscious, they both have a time and location, they&#39;re both remembered, the &quot;trail&quot; of thought is there in the sense that you can roll the thought backwards to what it&#39;s based on when you try to. But you don&#39;t always feel that both are local. One of them seems to be silent in a sense. It doesn&#39;t have any imagery, concepts or sounds like your normal thoughts do you&#39;re just aware of the thought happening. This distance shouldn&#39;t really happen with a conscious mind that&#39;s fully based in the body. It&#39;s like a second you is messing about with the thought, producing the exact same conclusions you would have made and everything, it&#39;s just that you&#39;re not seeing it happen. You have your clone as a coworker and he gives you updates when you ask. I think that&#39;s what Freud called the super ego. But I&#39;m not a psychologist so I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s very hard to see how my body can be me when these things are happening. In any case it&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t really matter with regards to how you should live.<br><br>Maybe we humans are far more different from each other than we think if you can come to the conclusion you&#39;ve made and I&#39;ve come to mine.", "comment_date": "2016-02-06T07:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iTurbo", "comment_text": "My biggest fear is that I won&#39;t be able to reconnect with my twin brother after I die in any capacity.

I grew up religious as a child. I had never thought much of it or why I&#39;m alive, but as we studied this topic, I started probing around. I asked myself the question, why do I exist? The first response was almost automatic: to behave myself for the afterlife, heaven (etc.). <br>     However, I started probing deeper. I had begun to shift away from being religious at this time in my life, so I started to try to think of a possible secondary reason. I drew a blank. I couldn&#39;t think of anything at all. Humans are programmed to reproduce, I thought. But why? Reproduction is just an endless cycle. You produce offspring so humans can live on and create more and more and more. I was truly stumped as to why that would be necessary though. <br>     And then the thought came: Maybe we have no purpose, maybe there is no reason we&#39;re here. I was terrified. There must be a purpose, I thought. But the more I pondered, the more I began to accept that I may have no real purpose. After all, humans are just a honed combination of the correct compatible elements. We don&#39;t have some special origin or distinction from anything else that is abiotic, we just got lucky. <br>     Once I had accepted this rationale, I felt alone. Almost everyone I know is religious. Almost everyone I know... believed something radically different. I began to regain my sanity though. Sure, I might just live for awhile and die; the end. But that doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t enjoy my life. I felt like the strongest way to attack this fear of uselessness was to accept it.<br><br>     This video communicates everything I&#39;ve been thinking about lately.

There was nothing to worry about before we were born. I fear death because I want to experience things. I have wishes and desires. I have hopes and dreams. Right now if you asked me if I would be willing to die after I furfilled everything I asked for, I&#39;d say no, and that&#39;s because I&#39;m greedy and wired to stay alive, but the thought doesn&#39;t seem very unlikely, because there would be literally nothing else to do here, I may even develop morbid curiosity then.

I believe that this is a closed off way of perceiving our world. <br><br>We&#39;ve been focusing so long on Science that we&#39;ve lost sight of its other half: Philosophy. We&#39;ve written off our consciousness as a perfectly natural phenomena, yet we understand so little of how it works. Our brains aren&#39;t the biggest, nor are they the biggest in relation to our bodies. We share &gt;95% of our DNA with Chimps, yet we have this supernatural ability to understand concepts like morals and emotions. And as far as we know, we are the only species in the universe that possesses this unique trait. That certainly makes us something special in a cosmic sense. <br><br>Science has gotten us this far, but I believe it&#39;s coming to a standstill. There have been no scientific breakthroughs in the past hundred years, with the exception of the untestable String Theory (doesn&#39;t sound very scientific though, does it?), despite our unprecedented connectedness in the Information Age. We, as humans, desire to know, but there are some things that will always be beyond our understanding. We will never know what lies beyond the event horizon of a black hole, or the exact position and momentum of a particle, or where the mass that exploded into our universe came from. I believe, similarly, we will never know what exists for us after death. For the time being, we have two theories, and neither should be written off as impossible until it is known for certain. This is the core principle of the scientific method and what has gotten us to this point in our history. Atheists think they &quot;know&quot; despite a lack of evidence just the same as theists do. <br><br>The only truly scientific standpoint, in my opinion, is agnosticism, but I&#39;m not one for fence sitting.

And I know what many of you are thinking of doing, and that&#39;s typing away, saying &quot;How can you know what happens after death?&quot; And here is my response to that ahead of time: We have had no proof of a/many god(s), so by extension, it is safe to assume that the afterlife is true nothingness. I know it is a scary thought to think about, but this video was meant to help comfort you. And I&#39;ve had more than my fair share of arguments about religion, so unless you have scientific evidence of a god or greater being, do not bother trying to talk to me about religion.

I asked my daughter to do the same but she wouldn&#39;t, her reaction was unexpected to me, she shook like she had just had a cold chill run up her spine and she gave me a very firm no. I don&#39;t know how others would react but I think her reaction showed how uncomfortable people are when confronted with it. The religious believe in an afterlife so death is no big deal to them, in fact it&#39;s such a non-deal that a lot never even think about it and it seems that when they do, they don&#39;t fully grasp the idea, the words &#39;&#39;I am going to die&#39;&#39; are just that, words, when they say death, they say it as if it&#39;s it&#39;s in quotation marks. I understand the concept of not being, I&#39;ve given it a lot of thought, it&#39;s actually an invasive thought I can&#39;t get rid of due to me being screwed in the noggin but I imagine it&#39;s like going under anesthesia, or passing out because you choked on a drink of water while driving down the road at 60mph (different story). I realized that 10 years ago, 4 years before I saw the man behind the curtain, there is no after, just nothing, at that moment, everything became more beautiful, I realized it was temporary and rare, I realized how lucky I was to be able to experience it, even if it is just temporary. I would love to experience everything, I&#39;d love to know the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything and at one time I thought I would, I believed the Wizard would reveal it all, I used to like the idea of living in eternal bliss but I&#39;ve since realized that living forever and knowing all the answers would cheapen the experience so I&#39;m not going to complain.

Sure evolution makes us fear death, but it&#39;s not what makes eternal oblivion incomprehensible. Here is the question: if we can truly die, than how are we alive at all? How can a finite amount of &quot;something&quot; be selected from an infinite expanse of &quot;nothing&quot;? To make a probabilities, a metaphysical model of the universe is needed that can exist with different variables among a probability distribution. Any atheistic model of the universe runs into one of two problems. The first is that consciousness is too easy,  meaning a simple solipsistic world is more probable than a complex sensory one, ala Boltzmann brains. The other problem is that consciousness would be way too hard, the probabilities of a universe capable of consciousness forming being astronomical. This is solved via the anthropic principle: we live in a universe capable of supporting conscious life because otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be observing it. But, if the anthropic principle can be used once, then why can&#39;t it be used again? It should grant us the same immortality that it grants our existence in the first place. Granted, this wouldn&#39;t guarantee keeping our memories by any means, but consciousness would have to live on, if not in this universe, than in some universe. Really the issue is your idea of nothing is inadequate, it&#39;s a physical nothing, not a psychic nothing, which is truly incomprehensible.

Without proof which is impossible, it&#39;s also impossible to distinguish and rank ideas based on probability. Examples: nihilism, quantum immortality, proper afterlife like in religions, infinite cycles of the universe, infinite cycles of infinite universes even, fractal design of the universe, reincarnation, etc etc in all the simmilar and possible interactions and versions, and my favourite one: INFINITY.

I want to exist in the state that I enjoy the best. To me it&#39;s being happy, and sharing it, not simply with mindless hedonism but with all the key aspects of happiness, which include the above &#39;meaning,&#39;(or purpose,) health, variety, warmth, and social belonging. Not that I want to provide it personally for all others, but to have a system in place that can provide these things with the capacity to scale beyond just humans. (I.E. Governments that are forward thinking towards all life on earth, not the stagnant, human-centric, currency driven, obsolete systems we have to contend with today. Of course we have physical/technological limits currently as well, but one day we may bypass them.)<br><br>   I do believe in the survival of the fittest. So, why not be the greediest bugger on earth and make bank on the backs of others so I can swim in my money vault and rub all the coins all over my face? Because groups are stronger than individuals, and they are truly the &#39;fittest&#39;. If we think of ourselves as parts of a social organism called Humanity, (which itself is part of the ultra-organism that incorporates all mass on this wet rock in space,) maybe we can tone down our over-active immune-systems that are killing perfectly good cells for no reason.<br><br>   Each of us, like cells in our own bodies, may be very different from each other, but can achieve greater things together than we ever could apart. With the ever increasing advent of Sentient AI&#39;s coming we may fear the systems we are creating as they might be greater than the sum of us. If the cells of an egg feared the life-form they would become part of, what progress would be made? <br> <br>   Therein lies my hope that there may be some point in mankind&#39;s future where we, or some system we become part of, can bend or even remake the laws of the universe, enduring past physical limits, temporal limits, energy limits, dark matter/energy limits. The critical part to making it there is doing it before a random cosmic incident wipes us out, or being foolish enough to rush science and doom ourselves. The best way to do that is to spread out as soon as possible into the stars, where we won&#39;t have all our eggs in one basket, so that if Earth is ravaged by some nuke-fest, cosmic impact, or whatever, it won&#39;t be the end of us all. <br><br>   How can we do that? It seems most of us are doomed to struggle with the far less glorious fate. We have been given a crap hand that prevents most of us from either being smart enough, drained us the desire to care, or feed us with consumer cravings for whatever fad is the soup du jour. The answer is exactly that:  to try to hold together society in our mundane, trivial ways, the same way the individual cells in our bodies can do little more than hold on to their neighbours. Somewhere far away from the skin cells on your heel, your brain cells can be thankful they are being supported by so many non thinking cells below it. Currently societies are stabilized mainly by economies, and as crappy and divided as they all are, they need stability to support our social brain cells, (inventors, scientists, philosophers, designers, etc.,) in this super-organism. And, hey, be glad you aren&#39;t a literal foot cell, it could never move up in it&#39;s world at all. As social cells we have much more role mobility than body cells, so one day you might be one the brain cells of the human race.<br><br>   It already happening, small things foment big changes, as more of us individual humans cells are chewed up by the inefficiencies of the system, the system is revealed as flawed and must either adapt or be replaced. Much like cells in our body, some cells will die having spent their life naturally or snuffed out by some brush with danger, and danger that alerts the super-organism of Humanity to begin processing a defence or skill. <br><br>   We are already incapable of truly seeing what kind of beast we make cumulatively, just as a single brain cell is incapable of experiencing the consciousness that they themselves have created and are part of.

Before then, those who did consider plate tectonics were called lunatics and rejected; and before that science had nothing to say about plate tectonics. So let me ask you this: did plate tectonics exist before science had anything to say about it? The answer is yes of course. So because science has yet to discover how the spiritual may interact with the physical, does that mean that there is no such thing as the spiritual? <br><br>Just because science has not yet discovered something\u2014or how it works\u2014this does not mean that it must therefore be false, untrue, or non-existent.<br><br>Please note I am NOT saying that &quot;spirituality must exist because we can&#39;t disprove it.&quot; All I am saying though is that you cannot claim these ideas false on the basis of science. You must leave other possibilities open. Because if you do claim that it is false on the basis of science, you claim that science must know everything.

I find it odd that I can only conceive of 1,2, 1 billion or -1,-2, -1 billion. I can&#39;t conceive of 0 in finite terms or infinite terms.<br><br>In a universe that seems ordered within a finite infinity I just really don&#39;t understand where my conscious goes. I don&#39;t think it makes sense. It isn&#39;t just desperation or fear its because the universe we live in is ridiculously fine tuned all the way from quarks or atomic structures all the way to the macro and the observable universe and one could presume further things exist than what we can see as always has been. <br><br>This clash between religion and science isn&#39;t because of fact and fiction or evidence and non-evidence in my opinion. I think the bigger clash is between purpose based explanations and explanations for existential understanding. <br><br>I mean throw scripture out for the purpose of philosophical discussion and is it really possible for something to truly cease existing in this world of potentially infinite infinities. From what I can tell most things are recycled or get broken down into something else completely, much like the mountains that you pointed out. <br><br>If I was to die, I could expect some sort of rebirth or to be atomic. Things are cycling more than they appear to be dying. Death makes as much sense to me as evaporation killing water. <br><br>The main thing we tend to have problems with as theists or atheists is whether to call some form of immaterial action sprouting existence &#39;god&#39; or &#39;natural order&#39; and whether things are finely tuned enough to need something that precedes material ordering the universes mechanics. <br><br>But regardless of what we call this immaterial agent or law or whether the agent or law needs to exist it can all be understood without observation just the same as most mathematical models that we try to understand today. <br><br>How I view things is even if I get hit by a car tomorrow or something extremely unfortunate happens to me, everything that exists is already way too fortunate. So I believe in some form of finite or infinite state of being that follows this one. Things just don&#39;t make sense otherwise. Its easy to say the lights go out and you die or that the brain explains everything when it gets damaged or shows impairments in living or being but like I said it could be at the atomic level or within one of the 11 dimensions that M-theory is going on about now trying to equate the universe.<br><br>Things are way too complex to be simple and nothingness just doesn&#39;t exist. Even in seemingly empty space or &quot;nothingness&quot; time exists when material things enter it and empty space is showing signs of having weight and all sorts of crazy stuff. The universe isn&#39;t as bleak as an abyss that sucks your being into it. There is always more. <br><br>Death shouldn&#39;t be an exception because its just an incongruence to state because of what I&#39;ve specified. People may not like the idea of immortal souls(or whatever you want to call it, it might not be little immaterial people in us or material but tangible and intangible or whatever) and bodies you can shatter into a million pieces but from what I can tell we only cause things that already exist to behave in ways when we observe it. <br><br>Anyone who states death as an absolute lights out is just making a prediction/theory/speculation. Reason is a double edged sword in this life. <br><br>Its easier or more benefiting so by that definition more rational to believe in heaven or something but because of believing all that exists in life and death is what can be observed, felt or exchanged about things constrained within our brains to our finger tips that somehow is more or less rational too? <br><br>I mean you guys can believe what you want about death but just know its belief and there is nothing more rational about the former or the latter because ultimately information is utilized as the new evolutionary tool for our convenience anyways. What you believe to be rational is just the negative assertion to the positive but nothingness assertions don&#39;t exist. I don&#39;t know is more of a neutral +1 and -1 seem the same sort of view. Heaps different from 0 or being incapable of forming an opinion. Even being incapable of forming an opinion is a psychological restraint as opposed to a cosmological necessity of outcome. :/", "comment_date": "2015-09-19T09:34:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MouthyTed", "comment_text": "Woah.", "comment_date": "2015-09-19T05:51:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dave vincent", "comment_text": "wow", "comment_date": "2015-09-19T02:01:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Wood", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.13-14?lang=eng\">https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.13-14?lang=eng</a> Here are some words from Mormon theology on the matter. <br><br>I like this video, and all the other ones I have seen on this channel. Nihilism is an important viewpoint to consider, I find it most useful personally as a thought experiment I can engage in to discover what my purpose and meaning in the universe is and to relate to my nihilist friends. <br>By considering nihilism I see myself as an ebb and flow of entropy, a ripple mirroring the substance and form of the universe around me and fulfilling the measure of my existence as the only logical conclusion of what matter in my parameters is capable of doing, no different than a simple reaction in a test tube. From this lens I lose the sense of the individual identity I was raised to own and more see myself as a part of the fabric of the universe. <br>I can see how he would say this promotes him to be the best and live the most fully he can. Personally though, I would say that any sense of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; would have to be redefined prior to seeking to make any change in the world. With my Nihilist hat on, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; are collective instinctual remnants of those trends in evolution that provided humanity with the advantages that have allowed us to flourish. &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; in this sense are no different than liver cells generously giving away glucose for the benefit of the whole organism (&quot;good&quot;), in opposition to brain cells greedily extracting more than their share (&quot;evil&quot;). From a nihilistic view, to me, the fact that this video essay concludes with an admonition to act according to his philosophy is no different than bacteria exchanging genes which may or may not confer fitness, according to the recipient and environment.<br><br>I don&#39;t know to what extent or how permanently this man has elected to align with the Nihilists, but I think it is important for anyone who is seriously pondering belief, faith, and purpose to consider all options. Nihilism is a very deliberate way of viewing the universe. On the opposite side of the spectrum of opinions on our ultimate purpose, many believe in fate or predestination. I see these concepts as sharing many similarities with Nihilism as I understand it. My personal philosophy falls outside of any philosophy which has predetermined a fate for me (even if any omniscient being already knows my ultimate fate). While I have chosen to believe that there is an eternal purpose to the universe (as opposed to the ~temporary purpose~ that he seems to believe in [to me if a purpose is temporary, it is no purpose at all]), this could not exist without some possibility of immortality.\u00a0<br>I haven&#39;t been to Chernobyl, but I have pondered death, and felt in my heart a feeling that life and love, goodness and kindness matter. From these feelings come my purpose, at my core I am driven o seize every moment and participate as best I can in what I see as the setup that our creator has established for us, because of hope in us. For me, I feel a drive to do everything in my power to enable the human family rise to our fullest potential. After all of that exposition, Isn&#39;t it surprising that he and I end up at similar conclusions?\u00a0<br>To me it&#39;s not surprising... though if you asked him about that coincidence (or the nihilist me that I am projecting onto him) he&#39;d say the answer is in our genes. According to me, it&#39;s all part of the plan. If you read all of that, wow, thanks. now on to the good stuff:\\/\\/\\/\\/<br><br>5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.<br><br> 6 Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.<br><br> 7 Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.<br><br> 8 Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.<br><br> 9 Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.<br><br> 10 And because of the intercession for all, all men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him, to be judged of him according to the truth and holiness which is in him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement\u2014<br><br> 11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.<br><br> 12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.<br><br> 13 And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.<br><br> 14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.<br><br> 15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.<br><br> 16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.

To make ourselves happy, right? Well, what if the life I desire is to kidnap and sadistically torture someone? What if that is what makes me happy? Should the &quot;feelings&quot; or &quot;rights&quot; of the other person affect what I do? Of course not, since I am the agent of my own life and happiness. I should not &quot;be afraid&quot; to do any of this. A million years from now, it&#39;s not going to matter if I were a saint or a monster. If errors and humiliation are forgotten, but great achievements are not, what if the great achievement I wish to achieve is to go down in history as a murderer? 99% of the people who lived in the late 1800s are gone, forgotten, not even mourned. But people remember Jack the Ripper. What if I am to &quot;make my own meaning&quot; that way? What if that&#39;s what I should &quot;get busy&quot; doing?<br><br>I&#39;ve heard it said &quot;If you need a God to give you morals, then what you lack is empathy.&quot; But in a nihilistic framework, of what use is empathy, unless it is something that makes you happy? What if you don&#39;t desire to be empathic with others? What if empathy doesn&#39;t make you happy, and sadism does? Should I not be &quot;cowardly&quot; and embrace my desires in that way? I&#39;ve yet to hear a logical argument to debunk it. Sure, I&#39;ve heard the argument that if we all acted that way, society would break down, and we&#39;d end up degenerating into barbarism. But why should I care about that, unless it affects me? If I &quot;make my own meaning&quot; of my own life, shouldn&#39;t I also &quot;make my own meaning&quot; of other people&#39;s lives, too? Unless their lives give me some sort of pleasure, they are meaningless and should be eliminated, since they&#39;re wasting my resources. And the resources, the people, the world is all mine, because I am the most important thing on it, in my view. Because my days are numbered, I should get busy with eliminating any competition I have, because my time to do what I want is running out, and I&#39;ll have more of it if I have more resources, which others are taking for themselves.<br><br>That&#39;s the way I see nihilism.

The belief that oblivion follows death does not stem from scientific understanding, and the belief that life comes after death does NOT stem from the incapability of perceiving human life ending in nothingness. +Veritasium I don&#39;t doubt that you are very intelligent and you mean well, but here I feel that you are treading in waters so deep that anyone&#39;s feet would fail.

That&#39;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &quot;superstar,&quot; every &quot;supreme leader,&quot; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br><br>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

I believe in this Creator and as I have studied physics over the past few years, I have come to believe in Him even more. He has a purpose in creations and I believe that He works through physical law to achieve those goals. <br><br>I fully recognize that my body will decay and die, but I truly believe that there is a part of me, some immortal stuff, the soul, if you will, that lives on. I believe this because of countless experiences and evidences that I have had. In many places and scenarios, I have felt an external divine power touch some deep part of me in an undeniable way. It has told me that my existence has meaning, purpose and potential. I&#39;m not the only one who has experienced this either - millions and billions of other people have also.<br><br>If a man does not possess an eternal soul, then is he any different from animals or other creatures? I believe the entirely of the human experience says that we are indeed different. It&#39;s the soul that compels us to compose a 9th Symphony, to carve a David, to construct the amazing buildings you talked about, to write words that move another person to action, and to endeavor to teach another person. It&#39;s the soul that drives us to create and causes us to resonate with others&#39; creations.<br><br>If man doesn&#39;t possess a soul, then what obligation do we have as human beings to &quot;love our neighbor as ourselves,&quot; or to &quot;do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot;?

What exactly is beyond this whole universe? Looking at Chernobyl I find it devastating in my view, this is our planet earth we are abolishing more than creating / preserving the old. The nature has displayed the ill effects of that lately. Doing this entire technology bloom without sensitivity of how much we are destroying is truly disastrous. Running towards the point of Death is the planet which is heavily sucked out of all its nutrients, is barren and life is 99 percent synthetic. Are we on the edge where we completely want to take out the human life towards extension due to the uranium/plutonium hunger?<br>We have evolved science from long, but still there are answers yet to find.  Take this as glee but who has thought of having cell phones in 19th century? What I mean to say is that if we don\u2019t know something, doesn\u2019t really mean that it practically doesn\u2019t exist. Maybe science is yet to find answers. Look at the example of Lucy movie, yeah Lucy! May be in the near future there will be science so advance that we shall be like this concept of the movie! May be, or maybe not. Who knows? Today it is a topic of mock for some, but when it is found; it will be awe inspiring to all of them.<br>We didn\u2019t know what will outlast us? What will be eternal? Maybe we are yet to be introduced to those elements in the near future. And yes you are right that true nothingness maybe in a grain of sand.<br>Yes rocks are permanent to human life. But ever wondered that what is permanent? Energy! Whatever we do whatever happens whatever is happening and what so ever will happen is due to some energy. And it cannot be created nor destroyed. Then where does all this energy has come from?<br>When you say death, the closest I can think of death, is when I am seeing the darkness with the lights off inside a quilt with my eyes open and not able to see practically anything!  Really Nothing! Claustrophobic surrounding of eternal darkness!  Not feeling my breath, not feeling my heartbeat, even my skin but the darkness and quiet as the quietest room in the world.<br>Where has this whole observable universe come from? And in-case if we find from where it has come from then who has made it. Is life really a simulation?<br>The mind never stops thinking; I mean I don\u2019t recall a moment in which I was not actually thinking of nothing! Even if I try to focus and concentrate hard on the element of thinking nothing, the only way my mind goes is towards death, and that scares me to death; well not being alive you can say. And that moment is when I am awake before sleep, trying to sleep but never before 2.30 am every night<br>Mind is a powerful machine it can do amazing things which no one can ever dream of. But yes our soul being eternal makes us cowardly because we have seen deaths and we have seen decay-able parts decaying.  The fear that comes from within is the fear of loss, moreover the fear of Life<br>Like from the beginning so many living organisms have died. I get it that their physical bodies are decayed but, what about that energy from life in all of those dead?<br>Sometimes I wonder that why the greatest thinking abilities come at night before sleeping. Thinking hard until wake up jumping off with fear of death due to severe anxiety or hibernate to sleep.<br>I am writing my views to you on your findings and a friend sitting next to me has no interest in that but to watch the eat-street soap of exotic street food around the world.

Empathy is obviously a good thing, it helps us to function as communities, work together, and care for vulnerable people. It has no use when someone has died though, yet I mourn when someone dies.

We can use these idioms to help us cope with the impossible, but in the end they are just coping mechanisms. In this man&#39;s opinion, decision, and observation...Having one&#39;s own truth, giving 110%, and existing in a superposition are far more delusional than believing in a possibility of life beyond life.

I come at this as a man somewhere between cultural Catholic and a devout Catholic, but I appreciate that we reach similar conclusions. For me, nothingness/life as a forgotten dream is my hell. I don&#39;t deny that it&#39;s quite possible that&#39;s all there is in the end, but I hope, and oftentimes believe, there&#39;s more. Hope is my compass, and to travel in the direction it points to, my nihilism is more targeted. It takes the form of analytical criticism - of institutional and cultural authority. Why do we have to do things this way? What&#39;s really going on here? Many of life&#39;s mysteries are simply the intended or unintended results of other people&#39;s choices to act or not act in certain ways, perhaps generations ago, whether they had certain knowledge or not. Once you realize how relatively little personal control you have over your life in the global sense, let alone cosmic, it becomes quite liberating actually, because you and &quot;the most powerful people on earth&quot; are actually pretty much on the same playing field in terms of your human capabilities and potentials. We all die, so we all live with the paradox of finitie amounts of time and infinite imaginations. Realizing it was always that way makes it possible to imagine and realize a better here and now for yourself and others. There&#39;s no natural hierarchy or social order, only that which we construct so as to improve the lives and legacies of ourselves and fellow human beings. So, why settle for a crappy version? Why not be more equitable in love in the here and now? That&#39;s where any hope of transcendence lies, whether you believe over time or outside of time, either way beyond our own individual experiences. I&#39;m not advocating one -ism or -cracy system over another, only pointing out they all have the same vulnerabilities and challenges because they&#39;re all inventions of human beings. We live, fight and die by what are ultimately delusions, all the time. Why not at least live by the paradigm that the only thing worth living for, risking death for, is the present? We need to constantly be critical, creative, inspirational, compassionate, empathetic, because only those things improve our present - our relationships with each other, or at least offer the hope of ultimately doing so.

I had to go get them looked at. They put the drops in, gave me some tests, and sent me out with some sunglasses and told me not to take them off for a while. I took them off. It was an overcast day and not very bright out. When I took the sunglasses off what I discovered was that everything around me was much more beautiful than I&#39;d ever seen before, because more light was entering my eye. That light was always there I just never saw it because we&#39;re built to filter it out. So that beauty is always there, always. But we rarely see it. At some point we figured out how to change our mechanism to let more light in so that we could get glasses. That sure was good for me. I would never have known otherwise. Thankfully I could already see with my eyes, without a frame with which to understand what was happening I think that the experience would have been useless - how could I even take it in? No pun intended.<br><br>So, not only do I think that our ignorance holds us back, I think the very frames with which we gather/create/learn knowledge holds us back as well. &#39;Holds us back&#39; is sort of a poor phrasing here, because it suggests there is somewhere we should be which itself is a frame we regularly use to understand ourselves and our lives.<br><br>I&#39;m not exactly sure if our sense of permanence is a delusion. I&#39;m not even so sure if that is a useful way of thinking about ourselves - permanence/impermanence/delusion/reality. I think saying our permanence is a delusion is similar to saying our permanence is delusion, just more blunt. Our sense of permanence is a sense of permanence and may have nothing to do with either delusion or reality. I don&#39;t even really saying &#39;delusion or reality&#39; as my story above illustrates.<br><br>If the point is &#39;go have a good life because it&#39;s going end&#39; is the point, as the coda of your video, why is impermanence the motivating reason?

Because whether or not there is existence after death, our life here IS temporary and we should make the best of it.\u00a0<br><br>tl;dr If this works for you, great, but realize it doesn&#39;t make you better or worse for it.

I don&#39;t believe in God, religion, magic, psychics, or anything that can&#39;t be explained. When I think of death, I don&#39;t think that I will go to heaven or hell. I don&#39;t think my memory will be wiped as I  am born again. I don&#39;t think my soul will be free to wander. I think that my consciousness, the processes in my body &amp; the things about me that make me, just end. They stop existing. I won&#39;t be floating in a void, or in heaven or hell or purgatory. I won&#39;t be reincarnated. There will be no &quot;me&quot; anymore. Just as it was before I was born. Before &quot;I&quot; was a sperm cell. When &quot;I&quot; was the chemicals shot hundreds of trillions of miles from supernovae, and so on. This outlook is terrifying, &amp; impossible to imagine. But it has led me to strive to work better in school, maintain fitness, &amp; be happy, because this is the only chance I have. Whenever I think deeply about this I&#39;m struck with chills &amp; the thought of loneliness, but I&#39;m comforted by the knowledge that I won&#39;t be lonely... Because I won&#39;t be anything. I&#39;ll be gone. I feel strongly in my intuition of these things, &amp; I would never be happy if I believed otherwise. Make yourself have the best life possible as there&#39;s no going back, &amp; I believe there&#39;s nothing after. This is why I am so caring when I see an unattractive, stupid, or an otherwise unappealing person, I get sad for them. Knowing they&#39;ll live their one and only life where they will always feel lesser. It breaks my heart how easy someone can die. I see clips of car crashes where people die instantly, &amp; I get a rush of chills, thinking not about their family or their friends, but how they will never exist ever again. Their consciousness is gone. They are gone, &amp; there&#39;s no way to fix that. Sometimes when I crush a silverfish or spider I think: &quot;I ended a life forever. It will never come back &amp; it didn&#39;t see it coming. It was happy one second, &amp; gone the next.&quot; This is a belief I hold deep in my heart &amp; I get a &quot;no no no&quot; feeling when i think otherwise. Love yourself, push yourself to succeed, make your life great in such a way where you don&#39;t need to take hard drugs that lower your life expectancy. Stay fit. Be happy in the long run so you never think you are lesser than others &amp; never are disappointed with your life. Don&#39;t commit crimes that limit the amount of time you have in this free, limited life you&#39;re living. Consider yourself lucky to be in the position to read this on your phone, &amp; take advantage of your privileges so you can succeed &amp; make the most of your life. <br><br>I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s an afterlife, but if I die &amp; find out there is, I will be happy.

They were completely blameless. They were deceived into disobeying God, and were expelled from the garden. They had the worse failure ever. That failure lived on in the human nature of their descendants, and still lives on today. Their descendants were given rules to make up for their own failures, which were metaphorically genetic, and ultimately couldn&#39;t. God still wanted to erase that failure, so he came up with a better idea. He sent Himself down in the form of a man, and lived without failure. He took the punishment that was righteously given for all human failure, so that we would be ashamed no more. If anyone believes in him, their humiliations and failures are permanently forgotten, and all the successes and achievements are remembered even more.<br><br>I felt that this needed to be said.

And so, there is a presupposition that truth exists. Otherwise, there wouldn&#39;t be any point of talking about anything. If truth exists, then there can&#39;t be such thing as &quot;relative truth&quot; where it can be &quot;true for you, but not for me&quot;. Because to assert relative truth is to deny itself (since the statement would no longer be relative) and to deny a relative truth is to deny the statement that it&#39;s making. So cold, undeniable, hard truth must exist. And it exists whether or not the human race is alive or not. So, one big question is how did we arrive at it? It&#39;s either through natural means or supernatural means. If we say that we evolved to see truth, is that true? Does evolution really give us the ability to see truth or only what works for survival, and does that align with truth, and how do we know that it does? (There&#39;s a TED talk on whether or not its beneficial to see delusions or truth, turns out that seeing perceived things is actually more beneficial then seeing things the actual way they are. I forget the title. sorry &gt;.&lt;) But, can we use the faculties that evolved naturally and only work for survival to make claims for truth? Can we say that &quot;because we got to where we are now that we have discovered truth through evolution?&quot; That seems to be a circular argument since the claim is that through evolution we discovered truth and that statement is true because we are here and through evolution we discovered truth, etc. etc.", "comment_date": "2015-08-20T22:04:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Hart Ritchie", "comment_text": "What is the difference between a stone Buddha and a Buddha made of flesh?", "comment_date": "2015-08-20T22:02:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rouzbe Akhlaghi", "comment_text": "&quot;Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here.&quot;", "comment_date": "2015-08-20T22:01:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Cools", "comment_text": "I was feeling awful and was nearly crying when you spoke of the great nothingness.

That the \u2018I\u2019 of my infancy and the \u2018I\u2019 of my adoloence and the \u2018I\u2019 of my present typing are in some way the same \u2018thing.\u2019<br>But this is not rationally the case.

To say that I end when my body dies is arbitrary; anyone outside observer would see that my body is still fully dynamic engaged with the processes of the world.

No.<br>So it is insufficient to identify the self with a particular sensation or collection of sensations.<br><br>And because there has been as of yet no proper explanation of how qualia can arise from certain complex configurations of matter but not others.<br><br>And also because you imply that the mind is not only dependent on a certain body for experiences now, but that it was always dependent on that body and will always be dependent on that body, so that when the body is destroyed, the mind will have no where to go and sensation will cease. A blind man may say that colors do not exist because he cannot see them, but as theists love to say, &quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;.<br><br>Moreover, there are many who claim to have experienced such things as past life memories, ghosts, out of body experiences, telepathy, and so on. And while admittedly there isn&#39;t enough evidence for these things to convince most people, partially because of the mental nature of these phenemona and partly because there have been many frauds, perhaps the blind man should consider that just maybe there are those who truly KNOW that there is more out there than what he has come across.<br><br>Not that I&#39;m one of those people, because I&#39;m not, but I do believe that the reason many people, including myself, are so against your view &quot;annihilationism&quot;, is not because we are afraid of death or because we need a heaven to give our lives meaning, but because deep down we feel that there must be more and that life - conscious experience - can&#39;t just appear out of nothing and disappear again like that.

In a sense the meaninglessness of the universe could be seen quite plainly, every thing we know of that has a beginning has a end. And if we were to look at the start of the universe in reverse we would end up with nothing. However do all things suffer from this delusion? I mean to say we as a being with a consciousness are able to question things and their reality, but does a goat suffer from this delusion or a rock? We can not ever be all to sure for we do not know if a goat or a rock has a consciousness, because it would be one different from our own or we be blocked by our inability to communicate with that form of consciousnesses. And perhaps a rock or a goat can see the truth whether there is anything eternal about itself or not. I agree that the belief their will always be tomorrow is a delusion, and in a sense everything is meaningless because it will all be forgotten in the currents of time, and at the end of everything will not effect the out come. This is all true unless there is something outside of the universe and time, something that put reason into it all, now this may be our &quot;delusion&quot; that promotes me to say this, but logic gives way to such a conclusion in many different ways, (now i know you weren&#39;t making an argument against God and I apologize if this seems like a incoherent batter of...words) but I guess all that I am trying to say is that the meaningless of the universe and the impossible conception of nothingness only further promotes the existence of God. Perhaps I made no sense at all, I am no where near the greatest who could articulate this view. However I would like you to know it. Perhaps because its part of the delusion that I am making a mark that will last forever by commenting this, but then again it might be a meaningful mark that will help others.

Although I see it from a slightly different perspective:\u00a0<br>You said we were delusional because we think we are eternal, which creates the fear of making mistakes because these mistakes will stick with us forever.\u00a0<br><br>First of all, I am not religious. I was and still am an atheist (kind of) and I am kind of a phyiscs nerd (thats probably why I subscribed to your channel).\u00a0<br>My perspective might sound very different at first, but stick with me please:<br>We are delusional because we think we will die and think we are impermanent. This may sound like the complete opposite of what you were trying to say, but it isn&#39;t: Believing that we will die and thinking that this life is the only opportunity for us to do things creates the anxiety of making mistakes. Thinking that death is &#39;the end&quot; creates the need for meaning and purpose. &#39;Finding the life purpose&#39;, &#39;doing something meaningful&#39; and &#39;stop doing senseless things&#39;. You see, it&#39;s like saying: &#39;Okay, this is my only chance. I have to use it wisely and with purpose.&#39;<br>This is the delusion we live in, in my opinion.\u00a0<br>Because in reality, we ARE eternal. Knowing that this life and it&#39;s meanings and purposes is just one of infinitately many ones, instantly creates the feeling (or the &#39;thought&#39; as you said) of nothingness. The feeling in which you know, that nothing in life really has a purpose or meaning to it and is in reality nothing more than a &#39;game&#39;. A game in which you play a character who is not knowing that he is eternal, which drives him to do &#39;important&#39; things. Why? Because what would he do if he knew that he were eternal and that death is not the end? Why would you need to do anything in life then? You could just sit on a stone by a beautiful river and meditate until you die, because you know that this death will not be the end and it does not matter how you are using your life or what you are doing in life. So we act like we are not eternal, just keep the game of life going.\u00a0<br><br>If you don&#39;t like the thought of &#39;reincarnation&#39;, just think of the universe as infinite and you will come to the exact same conclusion. First, if the universe is infinite, just try to compare the size of your brain with it and you will start to see how &#39;important&#39; the purpose of life is. Or a bit more complex: If the universe is infinite, there have to be infinitely many doubles of my body on infinitely many earths, everyone with very, very slight differences of eachother and myself (I think this should make sense to you if know some priciples of infinity). Now, if you were to make a choice between something A and B and you would choose A, you can be absolutely certain that somewhere in the universe at least one of your doubles would have chosen B, just because the universe is infinite so there HAS to be someone who chose B.\u00a0<br>So no matter what you choose, A or B, you can be certain that at least one of your infinitely many doubles chose the other. So it does not matter, if you chose the &quot;right&quot; one, because the &quot;wrong&quot; one will also be chosen somewhere in the universe. (also, there has to be &#39;wrong&#39; in order for there being &#39;right&#39;. Or the has to be &#39;A&#39; in order for there being &#39;B&#39;. Just another perspective.)<br><br>You see, a pianist could not play his piano while being anxious of playing the wrong note. There has to be some kind of confidence, or faith in order to play in front of a big audience. The pianist simply doesn&#39;t divide his notes in &#39;right ones&#39; and &#39;wrong ones. He simply plays. If he would divide them, as soon as he plays a wrong one, he knows, that the audience knows that played a wrong one, so he eventually gets embarrassed or anxious of playing more wrong notes. So he will get stuck in thinking of not playing wrong notes, instead of just playing. Because he thought: &#39;I HAVE to get it right&#39;. But knowing you are eternal, you know that you don&#39;t have to do anything and espiacially not getting anything &#39;right&#39;.\u00a0<br>I hope you understand what I mean. I will be pleased to chat with you in private if you are interested.\u00a0<br><br>I think you had an experience of the nothingness which lead you this kind of thinking of the world, exactly as I had this experience.

you use to reference the worm on your hook or the fish you will cook for dinner.\u00a0 But it is also the same &quot;it&quot; that you hear in &quot;It puts the lotion in the basket...&quot;\u00a0<br><br>And that&#39;s the problem with promoting nihilism.\u00a0 There are a lot of really nasty things I would absolutely do if I thought that 1) people didn&#39;t matter, and 2) I could get away with it.\u00a0 Maybe this isn&#39;t the case with everyone, but I have to think it probably is for most.\u00a0 And\u00a0I&#39;m a reasonably smart guy, so I could probably think of a way to do this stuff without repercussions.\u00a0 There are two things that stop me:\u00a0<br><br>First, I believe that someone is always aware of me.\u00a0 Whether that is a Someone or just a someone, like my father or grandfathers, I don&#39;t know or care; but I definitely feel that what I do matters, and that a day will come when I will be proud or ashamed of what I did with my whole life, even the parts that were seemingly secret at the time.\u00a0 Second, and more importantly, I am not a psychopath.\u00a0 I think that people have an intrinsic value, beyond the purely physical, beyond their utility to my needs.\u00a0 And so I would starve myself to give the 5-year-old the last of the food and water.\u00a0 And I would control myself with the young woman, and if I did do something that caused her to react with fear of me, I would feel ashamed of myself.\u00a0<br><br>From a purely rational standpoint, this makes no sense - as a man in his prime, I have a better chance of surviving until rescue than either of them.\u00a0 From an evolutionary stance, I should take every opportunity to spread my genetic material (though eating its recipient might put a damper on my chances of procreation.)\u00a0 But most importantly, if everything is just physics, their lives have no value, other than what they can provide to\u00a0me.\u00a0 And that&#39;s just as true in the suburbs as it is in the lifeboat.\u00a0 Like I said, I could figure out a way to not get caught.<br><br>So there are two takeaways here: First, if the ship is sinking, and you see Richard Dawkins in your lifeboat, grab a float and take your chances swimming.\u00a0 Second, it might not be a good idea to generally promote nihilism - your first sign of success might be when your neighbor poisons you for your new vacuum cleaner.", "comment_date": "2015-08-20T04:27:13Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tebaldi", "comment_text": "I must thank you to do these videos.

Nihilism is, in a sense, scepticism gone mad.. I am reminded of a quote by Max Planck, it goes something like, &quot;Science will never solve the ultimate mystery of nature, for in the final analysis, we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve. Anyone who has been seriously engaged in scientific work realises that over the entrance to temple of science are written the words: Ye must have faith. It is a quality that any scientist cannot dispense with.&quot; The reason for this is simply because science deals with seemingly inert physical entities that derive from the particular kind of conscious experience known to humans. This is nothing mystical.. We clearly must use the tools and intellectual ability with which we find ourselves with to decipher this great experience we call nature. It&#39;s analysis is science, a purely naturalistic methodology. But that&#39;s not everything. We choose how we define words and scientific concepts.. Change the meanings of those words and you change your entire world-view. When you realise that nature is not a set of words, and that words and theories and proofs are simply labels for patterns in a reality our intellect is too unreal to derive, you will see that, yes, everything is impermanent--your mind, your body, the planet--but you can bet your life that there is something permanent, somewhere, somehow. Some substance that is too primitive to be called a thing--a quantum vacuum or a universal wave-function, who knows. Combine this with the direction academic philosophy of science is heading, which is to say, away from reductionist physicalism and towards some kind of physicalistic property dualism or panpsychism (I don&#39;t personally believe these are true, but they are a stepping stone), there is every reason in the world to believe that some sort of protoexperiential quality exists within the ultimate fabric of space and time. If you can identify with that, then you might find some ethic in it. Which is more than we can say for nihilism, which, remember, asserts that morality, love, kindness, sharing, and all intrinsic values, are abstractly contrived illusions.<br><br>I love your videos, truly, but science is not philosophy. It deals with fundamentally different questions. Anyone who has read the philosophical literature knows that physicists are not necessarily philosophers, and that there are truly puzzling geometric problems concerning the relationship between experiencer and experienced--multiple realisability, the sufficiency problem, the incompatibility of Darwinian evolution and strong mental emergence, conceivability of zombies, to name a few. This is one of the reasons Hawking will never be one of the scientific greats of the likes of Newton, Einstein, Bohr, Planck, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Bohm, etc..", "comment_date": "2015-08-20T00:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clasper", "comment_text": "yolo", "comment_date": "2015-08-20T00:43:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio Mendoza", "comment_text": "Veritasium this is the way I like to think of things.

If you only experience it once or twice and then forget, or you only ever acknowledge it as an intellectual belief, then it will no more change your mind than believing in a heaven will.<br><br>The other thing is, the fear, and the things that fuel it, can be very complicated defense mechanisms and can be influenced by traumas, by brain &quot;defects,&quot; and so on.<br><br>I think that &quot;your truth&quot; that you are putting forth is one useful way to reach the end goal of taking ownership of one&#39;s life and meeting fear head on.

As far as general modern consensus, nihilism is simply the opposite extreme of eternalism. Technically your view in this video fits into neither, since you acknowledged the implicit value of humanly-manufactured meaning.

We take caution because failure would end us. If you believe that you&#39;ll continue should the worst happen, what penalty is there in failure?

Many people get attached to the idea of one or another. I can feel this within myself too. Even though I do respect and appreciate the video, personally, I am inclined to believe that the soul is eternal. I do not want to attach myself to anything, I do not wish to argue, but I will give an intelligent response to your video.<br><br>The debate between theist and atheist has been going on for thousands of years. There have always been people who do not believe in a higher existence, in a god. And there have always been people who do believe in them. People have used thousands of arguments back and forth. They have used really good, really compelling arguments aswell. But none of them have ever wiped out both atheism or theism. The arguments are there. If you believe in a god or a higher existence, then your search will be for the arguments in favor of god and against the non-existence of it. If you don&#39;t believe in him, it will be the opposite.\u00a0<br><br>The problem is that most people are not willing to really listen to the arguments that go opposed to their beliefs. Their beliefs become part of them, part of their self. In a sense, being proven wrong is to die. This is why people barely ever listen to each other when they come at each other with opposing beliefs. Everybody is just there to prove themselves right and the opposing team wrong. They don&#39;t care about being right, they care about being acknowlegded as right.<br><br>Most of us in the west thinks of people in the east as naive idiots for all their religiousness and spirituality. We may not say that about them, but we think that. Conversely, they think us as fools for believing we have only one life with (at least in their eyes) such clear and compelling evidence of god. It&#39;s really a matter of how we were conditioned to view the world as.<br><br>I am not trying to let people believe that god exists, but since I feel there are much more atheists then theists (I use theist in the sense that the person beliefs in something higher than him/herself), I will provide arguments simply to consider for people who belief that a higher existence does not exist. If this was a video where people were mainly theists, I could have provided arguments that indicate the opposite. Simply because I do not want people to attach themselves to one another.<br><br>One of the most compelling questions that I have asked myself lately is this one: With all this scientific research going on, then why, if god or something higher would exist, has his existence or traces of his existence not been proven by science?<br><br>I have given this much thought and the most fertile answer I have found is that people simply will not go to that which they do not want to belief. Another good one is that god may not be proven or tested since he is a completely subjective, immaterial phenomenon, something which lab testing can not reach.<br><br>But let me paint you this picture, let&#39;s just imagine, just for this thought-experiment, that paranormal phenomena do exist: From all the scientific researches that have been done, just a small percentage are being done about a subject that could possibly indicate a higher existence than the material world we live in. (like paranormal phenomena). Most of those experimets are problably done with a skeptic attitude, people eager to disprove it. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s about telekinesis, the ability to move objects with one&#39;s mind. Problably most of the subjects invited to prove this phenomena through scientific research do not have any psychic powers. The ones that do have them, are possibly too nervous or unwilling to show them in front of scientists.<br>Then you remain with a small percentage of a small percentage who are showing the scientists that their supposed fable is an actual reality, by moving a glass or table for instance.\u00a0<br><br>Now you have a bunch of astounded scientists. Some of them refuse to believe what they have just witnessed, they simply will not allow them to belief otherwise even though they have seen it with their own eyes. Others admit that they are not sure, and again other scientist start believing in these phenomena.<br><br>Then the next step: Who is brave enough to publish this, to make it public. If you have scientists who are sincere enough to themselves, they may not be sincere to the world because they fear of their reputation. Publishing something like that is a huge risk because people might start thinking they&#39;re lunatics. And who could blame them? People can be enormously defensive and judgemental to people who threaten their beliefs.<br><br>Let&#39;s say the scientists actually decide to publish the research. First, there are not so many mediums (websites or magazines) who would want to publish such a research. The ones that do, how many people are going to read it? That is the first question. Second question: Who will take it seriously? People are inclined not to believe it, so they problably won&#39;t. \u00a0Especially if they have not had any personal experience with such phenomena.<br><br>This is just an example of how people filter what information is being accepted. I have heard about studies where something like this happened.The basic thing is this: If information goes against one&#39;s beliefs, it is rejected, ignored. If it goes in favor of, it is being embraced and used.<br><br>Second thing: Do you think we have no soul? Do you think everything that we do, think and desire are just biological processes?\u00a0<br><br>It would seem logical at first, according to logic to think that. I can understand. But if everything is simply biology, then you would have no choice in any matter whatsoever, you would deny the notion of free will. Is it not? It is a confusing matter to me too, but according to logic, if everything is simply biology, everything that you do happens in spite of you. In fact, you think there is no &#39;you&#39;, except your biologic, physical &#39;you&#39;. But you could not choose anything. So to say that something happens in spite of you is even wrong, you could say: &#39;something happens&#39;.\u00a0<br><br>Yet we all say it in words: &quot;I can&#39;t do this to my body&quot;, &quot;I can&#39;t live with myself any longer&quot;, &quot;A part of me wants this, another part does not want it&quot;, &quot;I am hurting myself&quot;.\u00a0<br>The most significant one of these I find this one, Eckhart Tolle had a transformation through it: &quot;I can&#39;t live with myself any longer&quot;. He asked: &quot;Who is this self I can not live with?&quot; To say something like that instanly implies a duality. There is something, the &#39;I&#39;, and the &#39;self&#39; that cannot be lived with. How can you say it is all of the same thing? It&#39;s a really deep matter and I don&#39;t compeltely grasp it myself either, but do you feel like it&#39;s possible that the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;self&quot; are the same thing when everything is just one thing? I can not imagine it, can you?<br><br>You notice, you are aware. You are aware of what you are doing right now, you are aware of what you are seeing right now. Sometimes not fully, sometimes partially aware, but you are aware of it. If you hold out your hand in front of you, you feel it, you see it. But if you are simply a biological organism, how can you be aware of it? Then what I write here would be unconcious commands. The you would look at your hand, but not see it, not be aware that there is something that can be seen. Then you could try feel it, but you would not feel it because you would be like a command of a computer. Pain would be an instinctive reaction, but you would never suffer from it, because you could not be aware that it&#39;s even there, everything would be automatic responses. Just think about it!<br><br>Could there be loopholes in my logic? Possibly. Because I am just an ordinary human being. But it is something to really consider and really think about.\u00a0<br><br>To finish off let me leave you with this. You can have thousands of arguments in favour of, and thousands of arguments against god, or anything for that matter, but you would not be sure. You could have dedicated your whole life to prove something, you may have collected thousands of pieces of &#39;evidence&#39; (if that even exists at all), but you can not be sure. There is always some kind of counter-argument that can be made, something to dismantle it. You can say that if you look at your hand, that &quot;this is my hand and it&#39;s right here&quot;, but you do not even know if your hand is an illusion. Your hand may only appear to be there, but in reality other people don&#39;t see your hand. You may ask other people if they see your hand, they may reply with &quot;yes&quot;, but they can be lying. You can not be sure. I&#39;m starting to think the only thing that I can know for sure is that &#39;I am aware&#39;.\u00a0<br><br>So I can not say that I believe that god exists. I honestly don&#39;t know. Based on what I&#39;ve experienced and realized I am inclined to belief that he exists, but I can not be sure. I can not be sure of anything I have typed in this comment. &quot;Why say anything at all with a sense of certainty if you\u00b4re not sure abou anything?&quot; You may ask. It&#39;s because it&#39;s an expression of myself. Yes, strictly speaking I do not know anything, but I do not only function out of pure logic, remember that. I aim to inspire and break through some conditioned beliefs, I don&#39;t aim to not make any mistakes anywhere.<br><br>Just remember this last thing: You can have all the evidence against or in favor of god, but you do not and can not know for sure. You have to admit that you are not sure. If you&#39;re really honest with yourself, you can not do otherwise.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T12:41:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gregkrazanski", "comment_text": "I guess I can appreciate what you&#39;re saying in this video but I find this somber, philosophical, documentary-style-with-cuts-of-random-stuff-happening-with-sad-music is not why I like this channel.

Everyone at one time feels or at least thinks about the idea of something more or that there is some sort of afterlife. That&#39;s because its wired into our brains by the creator. Not just because we as humans are self idolizing individuals, but because we as humans are hard wired to pursue a greater power than ourselves. and perhaps the true greatest delusion is to convince ourselves that we are the greatest power.

Also look at the Jews. throughout history they have been persecuted over and over and over again. and even though it seems weird, I&#39;d say that is the best proof outside of any religious text, that God is real. The craziest thing is, that God loves everyone. even those that do not believe such thing exists. He loves everyone so much that he made the way for anyone and everyone to spend forever with Him. and all he asks is that you believe that his son, Jesus, died so that you can be considered blameless in God&#39;s eyes.

I am being sincere here. because I don&#39;t even see it anywhere near how you see it, in fact your way of thinking seems almost alien to me. I don&#39;t say that to insult but to illustrate how amazingly the end result is similar. you say that death equaling non-existence is liberating for how it makes you live every day to the fullest because you have no fear of failure. for me I find the idea of there being some greater meaning and eternal existence liberating for how it makes you live every day too the fullest because there is no reason to fear death therefore no reason to fear failure. in fact the thought of non-existence I find much more frightening and limiting, it&#39;s the thought of eternal peace and love that keeps me most productive and happy.<br><br>what&#39;s cool is that we both have diametrically opposing views yet ultimately the end goal of those idea leads each of us to a state of zen. actually I just realized a strange irony, we are both in a sense equally delusional. I say I am certain or at least believe in my idea to be correct but you are just as certain that you are correct. you did call believing in eternal existence, even in a spiritual sense, delusion which means that you see the opposite as being true, your idea of non-existence. however the real truth is... we don&#39;t know what the real truth is. death and the nature of existence is the ultimate mystery that is like a pitch black hole, you simply cant know what&#39;s in there unless you jump in. (or tape a light to a camera and hang it on a string but that&#39;s where the analogy kinda falls apart.) both of our ideas are just us not wanting to accept the uncertainty of not knowing. if we can&#39;t open the box instead of having that nagging &quot;what&#39;s in the box&quot; feeling we would rather just come up with something that we think sounds like it should be true, consider it a mystery solved and and then just push the whole topic into the attic of our minds so we can get back to living our lives.\u00a0<br><br>as a final note. since this is a youtube comment I want to be clear that at no point was anything I said meant to be taken as an insult or as me belittling you for your opinion or trolling or anything like that.

We&#39;re a bundle of different sensations and motivations and feelings.  We want to do something, but sometimes we can&#39;t.  Why not? Different parts of our psyche fight with other parts.  We get drunk and part of one voice stops working, stops telling us no.  We can have some other chemical and all of a sudden we can do the things we wanted to before, but couldn&#39;t for some reason.  We can be depressed, or manic. But whatever the case, we don&#39;t have complete agency over our entire body.  Try to fight against anesthesia, you can&#39;t.  But yet, our respiratory and circulatory system can keep working. <br><br>So what are we? We are a collection.  We&#39;re each a bunch of pieces that work together.  Each of these pieces communicates with each other really rapidly.  Biochemically we send hormones to and fro, electrical potentials, and pulses across neurons.  Each cell theoretically possible to live on its own, if you just happened to provide it with the right environment. <br><br>So then what are we? I think about the Ship of Theseus.  No single part of us is necessary.  We could take out pretty much any single cell from our body, and our consciousness wouldn&#39;t follow that cell. If a doctor with incredibly precise tools were to remove one single neuron we would be fine. If you could replace it with an artificial one in the same configuration, we would be fine.  If you were to swap it with a similar one from another person it would be fine. The individual cell isn&#39;t really important, it has a few jobs, and either it does them well, or it doesn&#39;t and other ones pick up the slack.  But for us, no single cell defines us.  <br><br>But then where do we end?  If we are the manifestation of the many billions of pieces of our body working together in concert, what defines the edge of us? Is our identity in our DNA? People are born with chimaerism, and can have different genetic makeups that put together a single body.  They don&#39;t feel any different themselves.  They just have one body as far as they&#39;re concerned.  Similarly, identical twins feel their identity is as disparate as anyone else, sure, they might be closer, or identify more closely, or whatever else.  But you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a set of twins that would argue that they should both go to jail for the crime of either of them. <br><br>So what&#39;s the difference? Is it just that when our cells communicate with eachother, they do it simply and quickly?  When we communicate with other people, we have very complex ideas that we communicate slowly and imprecisely.  But then isn&#39;t that just a question of scale?  I mean, in astronomical terms, any communication we do with eachother is pretty much instantaneous.  So is our lifespan for that matter. <br><br>So if you look at it from a different scale, are we not each analogous to the individual cells that make up a single body?  One cell doesn&#39;t really recognize the presence of the whole body.  It can&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t have the inputs, it doesn&#39;t think.  Cells get specific feedback and act on that. But where people do differ from cells is that we can think.  While we couldn&#39;t see an entire body, we can talk in analogies, we can imagine, we can project, we can abstract.<br><br>We already do it.  When we talk about a country we might say &quot;France did this today&quot; or &quot;The USA is strongly against that&quot;.  We anthropomorphize.  Countries aren&#39;t humans.  But they do act like individual somethings.  The behavior of an individual ant is pretty pathetic.  Ants can get themselves stuck walking in circles because they&#39;re following behind their own scent trail.  But the behavior of an entire colony can be quite interesting, and it&#39;s reproductive cycle is like an organism, but it&#39;s a collective. <br><br>So I think about what I am. I kind of know what I am as a person, but if I was a cell, what would I be?  It would be important for me to do my selfish job, because I don&#39;t really know enough about my situation to second guess what feels good. As a person, I know that things like having kids, staying safe, building a legacy, those things drive me. But to add to that, if I am a part of a greater whole, then what changes? Not much really, except I want to respect others more. Everyone else is part of the same thing as me.  It&#39;s more than just a team, it&#39;s more like we&#39;re all one organism.  If I have the choice to help or hinder, I&#39;ll choose to help. If someone makes a mistake, I&#39;ll choose to forgive.  There&#39;s no reason for me to try to make others feel bad, because from some way of looking at it, they&#39;re a part of me too, and it&#39;s not particularly healthy to make myself feel bad. <br><br>And then there&#39;s that thing about permanence.  It makes it easy.  I know that I&#39;m not permanent.  I know I&#39;ll die one day.  That will be that, and there&#39;s nothing more about it. But that&#39;s fine, it&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be.  When skin cells die off in my body, that&#39;s a necessary part of my body&#39;s proper operation.  When they&#39;re alive, they really need to do the things that they do.  They are built in such a way that the normal operation and the normal environment leaves them doing exactly what they&#39;re supposed to. Their &#39;urges&#39; so to speak keep them doing exactly what they&#39;re meant to.  And if something gets broken, say they end up reproducing without end and not dying, then it&#39;s called cancer and it can kill a person. <br><br>But I guess the thing is, a skin cell doesn&#39;t want to reproduce malignantly. A skin cell doesn&#39;t want to do anything.  We are much more complex, we want a lot more, and we do a lot more. We think a lot more, and we plan, and we act very differently.  The kind of organism we make up can&#39;t be anthropomorphized.  It&#39;s more than a person, and it&#39;s even more than all the people.  Is this organism alone? Is it young or old? What are its goals? <br><br>Sometimes I think we&#39;re like the blastocyst. Just emerging from our spherical ovum.  Just barely getting ready to break the shell.<br><br>But I don&#39;t worry about me, at least not more than I need to.  I&#39;m not going to be judged.  But I do think I&#39;m a part of something that will outlive myself. Like any cell of my own body, I&#39;m not indispensable, but at the same time, without any cells, our bodies wouldn&#39;t exist.  I&#39;m a part of it. So who am I? Am I just the cell? Am I just the neuron that is firing to send the signal to the finger to make it press and type the letter? None of that would be possible without the cooperation of many.  So as far as that is concerned, they&#39;re all me. In the same vein, this individual is one of those parts that might be considered &quot;all me&quot; by something larger. <br><br>If I did have a problem with an organ, or a malignant tumor, I would see it as a problem with me. I might correct it or excise it, but I wouldn&#39;t judge it.  I wouldn&#39;t torment it in the pits of hell for all eternity. Why would I pass judgment on a malfunctioning part of my body? That&#39;s stupid.  Nor would I expect it to predict what I wanted it to do. I would expect it to simply act like it has always acted. And I might do things that hurt me.  I might end up burning myself.  Parts of me will die, blister, scar.  They all work in pretty predictable ways developed over a long period of evolution to close up and heal that wound.  But that&#39;s unfortunate.  It doesn&#39;t mean I would intentionally burn parts of my body just because I thought they were wicked. <br><br>I feel like part of something bigger, but that something bigger isn&#39;t something that we could really think of as a person, or as a master even. Just kind of a manifestation. I&#39;m not important.  I&#39;m not driving the boat, but then again, nobody and everybody is.  But it&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m not driving because I have no idea where we are, or where we&#39;re supposed to be going, and neither does anyone else on here.  But for all I know, the boat itself might be going somewhere that I can&#39;t see.  <br><br>Birds fly south in the winter, but I doubt that any individual cell in their body could explain to you why.<br><br>Regardless, I do know what feels to me to be the right thing to do, and the right way to act, and the right way to treat people.  And so I&#39;m going to do that.  But I&#39;m going to respect everyone else a bit more like myself than I might if I thought that I just had to pass some tests and live in eternal luxury.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T08:33:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fabi\u00e1n Daniel Mercado", "comment_text": "Bro.<br>Don&#39;t be fooled by nihilism.

It also pains me deeply, knowing that many or even most of us know little more than suffering before dying. And where is the pity for those who suffer? It&#39;s hard for people to willingly acknowledge the suffering when they can shrug it off, believing the ones who have died are &quot;in a better place&quot; now.

You call it a &quot;delusion.&quot;\u00a0I could guess why you might think that, but I don&#39;t want to put words in your mouth. Could I ask why?<br><br>Making meaning daily with each other\u00a0is all good and fine, as far as it goes (connecting with people and loving them is so very important, of course!), but it seems to me that it becomes just\u00a0meaningless\u00a0if it all comes to an end like everything else. It seems to me that you end up with the same problem.<br><br>Whether you fear death or look forward to nothingness or an afterlife, you still have to grapple with what the end truly is. So your decision to &quot;seize the\u00a0day&quot;\u00a0hinges on your assumption that there is no eternal soul. Again, how are you certain that there is no soul?<br><br>I&#39;d posit that your observations make more sense given a worldview where people do have a soul.<br><br>To back up my own assumption / worldview:<br>My own assumption that we have a soul stems from my belief that there is God. I believe there is a God for many reasons: faith &amp; revelation, yes, but more relate-able than that, because I can&#39;t escape the fact that we are inherently &quot;moral&quot; beings. We make judgments of &quot;this is\u00a0good&quot; and &quot;that is\u00a0bad&quot;\u00a0all the time and expect them to be universally/absolutely obeyed and observed. This only makes sense if there is a law-giver, that wrote such a moral law on &quot;hearts&quot;. I also think it makes more sense that the natural world requires a first cause outside of nature (God) rather than a self-existing nature, especially when you consider the linearity of our universe from big-bang to heat-death.<br><br>In my worldview (and many other worldviews, for that matter), we would consider the soul to be the eternal part of the person (that exists outside of nature) while the body\u00a0is the temporal / mortal part (that exists inside of nature, like rocks do). Lumping people&#39;s\u00a0souls/spirit/essence in with rocks, as you have, is a categorical error for our worldview.\u00a0That is:\u00a0Rocks are not more permanent than people, People are more permanent than rocks.<br><br>I agree that some people live under a\u00a0delusion that they will live forever and\u00a0deliberately put the idea out of their mind that our bodies are\u00a0mortal (we all eventually die), but I think the reason people do so is that we inherently <b>desire</b> to live indefinitely (have\u00a0eternal life). You said as much yourself too! <br><br>You mentioned that our\u00a0biology has woven into it\u00a0the mechanisms to reproduce and cannot even imagine itself outside of existence.<br><br>So, according to your own observations...<br>1) We desire to live eternally.<br>i.e. we put off the idea of death indefinitely, always looking for a new tomorrow.<br><br>2) We all struggle against the fact that we are mortal.<br>&quot;The sense of our morality should strike fear into us.&quot;<br><br>Your observations of our desire to live forever and your nihilist\u00a0admission that\u00a0&quot;it might drive you crazy to be confronted with the meaningless of everything all the time&quot; sounds a lot to me like what Solomon said in the book of Ecclesiastes:<br><br>&quot;He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man\u2019s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.&quot; -Ecclesiastes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKR-HydGohQ&amp;t=3m11s\">3:11</a><br><br>&quot;I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. ...\u00a0This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.&quot;<br><br>He comes to a similar point several times\u00a0that you concluded with:<br>&quot;A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?&quot;<br><br>But his final conclusion is this (notice who gives the wise words -- the one shepherd):<br>&quot;The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails\u2014given by one shepherd. Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.<br>Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.<br>Now all has been heard;<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 here is the conclusion of the matter:<br>Fear God and keep his commandments,<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 for this is the duty of all mankind.<br>For God will bring every deed into judgment,<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 including every hidden thing,<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 whether it is good or evil.&quot;<br><br>Have you considered that we might be\u00a0meant\u00a0to struggle with existential anxiety?<br>That we\u00a0could be\u00a0meant to struggle with our own mortality?<br>We fear death and the judgment that follows, because we know we fail to live up to what is truly good and even transgress against the moral law.<br><br>If we are meant to struggle, then a good God would provide a way to overcome. <br>He would provide hope.\u00a0<br>He wouldn&#39;t\u00a0want us to give up and declare that everything is ultimately meaningless.<br>(i.e. he wouldn&#39;t want us to become a &quot;nihilist&quot;).<br>He wouldn&#39;t want us to despair in the face of our shame and inadequacy either!<br><br>The good news (the Gospel)\u00a0is that a\u00a0good God, did provide that hope!<br>He isn&#39;t subjecting us to the futility of death without reason.<br>&quot;For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&quot;<br>-Romans <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKR-HydGohQ&amp;t=8m20s\">8:20</a><br><br>We are meant to struggle with death so that we&#39;ll\u00a0seek freedom as a child of God.<br>Who can become a child of God?<br>&quot;12 But as many as received him [Jesus], to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:\u00a013 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&quot; -John <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKR-HydGohQ&amp;t=1m12s\">1:12</a>-14<br><br>He wants us to know Him and and have life through His\u00a0Son, Jesus, our shepherd\u00a0who is the way, the truth, and the life.<br><br>The whole creation suffers because of sin and we scrape by\u00a0in a dying world.

This has not doomed those generations to inaction.

I watch them for entertainment and I especially don&#39;t do things on my main account, but I feel like this is a video I need to reply to.<br><br>I saw another person on here complain about being told &quot;your life story&quot;, but it&#39;s very relevant to this so I will start with it. I&#39;ve never really had a religion. For most of my childhood my parents were &quot;not Atheists&quot;, but that was in name only I think they would call themselves agnostic now. Regardless, I&#39;ve labeled myself as an Atheist since I first started to think about these kind of things when I was around 13.<br><br>I&#39;m almost 19 now and about to start my 3rd year of a computer science degree. I&#39;ve been struggling with a number of things recently. Especially the realization that I will be graduating in about a year and a half and I don&#39;t feel nearly ready to go out and get a job and take care of my self. To be frank, I don&#39;t know what I want to do other than to make enough money to support myself. Somebody with religion would probably find purpose in that, but without it I&#39;ve always been driven in essence to reach this moment and now I&#39;m wondering what to do next.<br><br>In an area more directly related to the video I&#39;ve been questioning my philosophy or rather perhaps lack of one a bit more. In particular, I&#39;ve begone to question my lack of belief in a soul. It may just be my ill designed brain getting in the way, but I&#39;ve always struggled with the idea that the brain could be purely mechanical. I can conceive of everyone else being so, but I can&#39;t understand how the sense of self comes in. I am aware of everything I type and there seems to be an observer behind my eyes. I also know the reasons why a soul makes no sense: our minds can be damaged by things that happen to our bodies, the brain seeming to indeed function based on purely quantifier able laws, but at the same time these among other things have made me wonder recently. Not about the God of big G&#39;s, I don&#39;t really think I could ever believe in that, but about the chance of my being wrong. I&#39;ve always held it&#39;s better to be wrong as an Atheist with the idea that no just universe would allow somebody who is acting on the only evidence he has to be punished for those actions and I still do, but now I&#39;m allowing more doubt and I&#39;m veering closer to the realm of Agnosticism.<br><br>All this being said I can&#39;t agree with you fully in your video. You seem to revel in the fact that all things must end and all people must die. You are able to use it as a motivating force. I disagree. I will agree that all evidence points to all life having to end, but is this inevitable? If so I would say we live in a very cruel world indeed, a world to strive against. We can do better. Maybe we can&#39;t keep anything alive forever, but we can someday come much closer. You talk about horizons forcing us towards better and more important things, but in reality few people function best with a deadline. Why should we as humans have a deadline? I&#39;m assuming in your readings you have at least encountered HPMOR. I recently finished it, and for all it&#39;s fails, of which I admit there were many, one of the things it has truly imparted to me is that ideal. That should be adverted and if it is in anyway possible we should strive for that. Your video in summery was thought provoking and inspiring, but I must disagree with the conclusion. The false sense that we can live forever may be damaging, but I see no reason not to strive to make it into a reality even if that effort will always fail to some extent.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T03:18:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Menaceblue3", "comment_text": "Get busy living or get busy dying.", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T03:18:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lochaby", "comment_text": "you really liked rans riggs video about the Salton sea didn&#39;t you?", "comment_date": "2015-08-19T03:18:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VejyMonsta", "comment_text": "It&#39;s good to see someone who actually understands nihilism.

So for almost thirty years,<br>this place has been virtually abandoned. These days, workers are allowed into the zone, but only for two weeks at a time. And that&#39;s not because the radiation levels are too high, it&#39;s actually for psychological reasons. More than two weeks in a place like this will apparently make you think strange things. And I was only here for four days, but I started to think about rocks. Yeah, rocks.\\\\<br>Rocks appear to be permanent. I mean I know that they aren&#39;t. Mountains are constantly eroding and in places the crust is melting back into the mantle. Rock obviously isn&#39;t permanent, but on the scale of a human life it is.<br>And people have recognized that fact. Rocks are permanent for thousands of years and I think that&#39;s what makes them important to us. I mean, a diamond is forever. We build these monuments out of rocks because they will outlast us and virtually every other material we can think of. Our modern structures of metal and glass are just rock refined by our ingenuity. Rocks are both pratical and symbolic. We seek to identify ourselves with rocks. We carve our heroes in stone because we want them to last forever. In there&#39;s a way in which we want that kind of permanence for ourselves to.\\\\<br>I think it&#39;s at the core of the desire to scratch our name into stone or<br>put your initials intwet cement, really made man rock, or fasten a padlock to a bridge. In this way, we try to push our impermanence from our minds. The monuments, statues, bridges, they give us a sense of continuity, stability, that this is the way it is and the way it&#39;s always been, like the way we first conceived of stars, static, unchanging, eternal. And this way of viewing the world helps us maintain our greatest delusion, the thought that we are in any way eternal.\\\\<br>We wanna believe that some part of us, our consciousness or our soul, will last forever. But what do you make of it then when you see stone is not even so permanent. Walking around Chernobyl I think it&#39;s understandable that I started contemplating not only the permanence of rocks but also their decay and by extension our decay, death, what the world would look like without people.<br>You know the closest I can come to imagining true nothingness is to picture the universe running really fast in reverse. All the galaxies squeezing closer together, stars expanding back into gas clouds and everything getting hotter and denser, compactifying until the whole observable universe could fit into a room and then shrinking further into a tiny point and then, nothing. Not the nothingness of empty space, but, real nothingness, which has no size, and no time.<br>To me, that is probably what death looks like. A nothingness so complete you wouldn&#39;t even miss it. For that, you&#39;d have to be there. But just as soon as I can form this thought, it evaporates, like a void in nature, the world rushes in to fill it. And this makes sense, because the hardware I&#39;m running has been developed over billions of years with the only requirement being that it frequently and accurately makes copies of itself. And it would help not in the slightest in the goal of making copies if the hardware could accurately simulate its own non-existance. When we do acknowledge our impermanence, it is often through incipid catchphrases like &quot;YOLO&quot;, or it&#39;s in art projects like Damian Herst&#39;s &quot;the physicsl impossilbity of death in the mind of someone living&quot;, which is just a huge shark in a tank of formaldehyde. A sense of our mortality should strike fear into us, like the sense I have when I&#39;m swimming hundreds of meters offshore and the water below is deep and dark and I can picture the shark swimming beneath me. The same kind of fate stalks us daily but not in this visceral way, just in a trivial, ignorable way, hence the delusion. You&#39;re permanent, like stone, always were, always will be. So, we are left hard-wired for denial, the selected inability to imagine true nothingness in a sack of particles that thinks itself eternal. This delusion is comforting and it makes living easier, might drive you crazy to be confronted with the ultimate meaninglessness of everything all the time, what called nihilism. But the same delusion I argue is also debilitating. It lulls you into a false sense of security, inaction, like a due date a long time in the future. There&#39;s always tomorrow, so we procrastinate living the life we truly desire. And we live in more fear. The sense that your soul is eternal makes you cowardly, because failure would stick with you forever, for really ever.<br>Shame, embarassment, disappointment, they would never leave you. A distant horizon encourages you to play it safe, live to fight another day, for after all, there&#39;s is always another day. And this is why I find nihilism liberating and emboldening. If you can really picture the nothingness that awaits you, then what is there to be afraid of. Errors and humiliations will be forgotten, but great achievements may not. We may have no meaning in the cosmic context of the universe, but we make our own meaning daily with each other. And this is the thought that leads to action. Your days are numbered, you don&#39;t know what that number is, but it&#39;s finite, so get busy with what it is that you want to do.

(Even if my religious beliefs as a Mormon have taught me that your points on death are incorrect.)<br>\u00a0 \u00a0I love this video because you have shown me a different view of the world, one without a God in one&#39;s life, purely scientific, a world that I had always imagined to be cold and narcissistic; but you told me about this world and made me realize that it isn&#39;t all negative in a Godless world.

I had never thought of it like that, that to think because I&#39;m eternal, I&#39;ll have time tomorrow to do that thing. It can wait. But, while you are wrong in this ideal of us not being eternal beings, you are right that we procrastinate our life because of it. We will die, (even if we will not be dead forever in my religion--I&#39;m a Latter-Day Saint, or Mormon--we will not live a life or in a world like this every again) and our time in this finite world will come to an end.

We don&#39;t have any human experience that can be trusted on the matter. We only have super natural things, and things claimed to be super natural that try to explain what happens after death. Either you believe these things or you don&#39;t. If you don&#39;t then you actually can&#39;t claim anything as possible fact. At that point it&#39;s just a guess from pure ideas with no real proof.

To clear this up, there is are really two kinds of truth, things that are true by definition (like math) called A Priori truths, and things that are true because they have been proven through evidence from the outside world called A Posteriori truths. The problem is that you need A Posteriori evidence to prove your A Posteriori truths, so they are inherently unreliable. This problem is often referred to a the Brain in a Vat scenario, and is demonstrated well in the Matrix. The assumptions that you use to resolve the chicken and egg predicament of evidence and truth will change your interpretation of the &quot;truth&quot; that you arrive at. Some people believe that there is an objective Truth to A Posteriori truths, but this is an assumption and impossible to prove or disprove.

So, you believe that there is a supernatural being in the skies who takes care of the universe and we are all going to continue to have a &quot;soul&quot; after death? That&#39;s fine, but the fact that you&#39;re saying that this &quot;god&quot; is supernatural means that you can&#39;t prove the existence of your &quot;god&quot; using any sort of physical proof in this universe. We all have opinions, and that&#39;s perfectly fine, as long as no one is killing each other over them. (They are, which is a huge problem on it&#39;s own.)\u00a0<br><br>But anyways, people are saying that &quot;oh my beliefs are true because some guy wrote it down on this &#39;holy&#39; document&quot;, which I find, well, rather unlogical. I don&#39;t believe that we are all programmed into some supercomputer in &quot;the real Earth&quot; just because I watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; recently. So why should I believe the Bible/ the Quran/ the Hebrew Bible? The point is that that&#39;s your opinion, but certainly not proven fact, and you shouldn&#39;t state it as such.<br><br>But that&#39;s my opinion, and others are free to believe in other faiths. Derek has a viewpoint, Christians have a viewpoint, everyone has a viewpoint about life and death, and if we will continue to be consious after death. After all, most countries have adopted a form of freedom of speech and/or freedom of religion, so believe what you want. I&#39;m not going to respond to any rambling replies about how I&#39;m somehow incorrect, because as I&#39;ve said a million times, everyone has an opinion, and no one opinion has the power to censor or block others.<br><br>As for the video, yes, I think that the video is a bit depressing, but you don&#39;t have to agree. The point is that we all have a limited lifetime, and so we all should appreciate our life and do what we want. As Derek said, we may not have a meaning in the universe, but we forge our meaning with each other. We know that we have a finite amount of time, and so we are encouraged to do stuff now, instead of waiting. Nihilism says that all will be forgotten someday, that everything will come to an end, and that there is no real &quot;meaning&quot; in the cosmic context of the whole universe. So, what is there to be afraid of? Anger, shame, and disappointment will eventually be lost, and so we all should live the life we want to- starting today.<br><br>Returning to the first topic, let&#39;s just all realize that it doesn&#39;t really matter what we believe or not believe (&quot;at least in this world&quot;, says religion), and there are many more important things in our life and we shouldn&#39;t worry about death, for that only worsens the life you&#39;re given. After all, if we want to continue to live better lives than our ancestors, there&#39;s no time to waste when we are trying to solve this generation&#39;s problems!<br><br>Oh... wait... right.

We may have no meaning in the cosmic context of the universe, but we make our own meaning daily with each other.

Regardless of whether our nature as humans is eternal or impermanent is irrelevant. It is blatantly anti-scientific to say that there are not some aspects of our universe that are eternal. The fact is that life is a fruition of the endless nature of that energy and systems of converting that energy from one form into another, this is scientifically undisputed. It can be said that a life form is more or less a system of energy conversions, one part of that system converts chemical energy to electrical energy, electric energy into mechanical energy so that an other part of that system can convert it back again. However, to say we completely understand the connection between energy and consciousness is also very unscientific. In our lifetime we will never fully know the connection between the energy that we know is within all things and its influence over consciousness. We have a general understanding of how the brain works mechanically but we have no idea how energy applied to a system like the brain, can cause consciousness or the ability to observe, or even why it observes anything at all.\u00a0<br><br>Whats that? For reproduction sake you say?\u00a0<br><br>In a hypothetically 100% impermanent universe, a universe where energy itself fades to zero, reproduction is purposeless and even such a thing as time or evolution wouldn&#39;t be a large enough driver to enforce the &quot;evolutionary need&quot; for reproduction, a need for which would only be a possibility in a universe of infinite possibilities, and in a universe of infinite possibilities one would have to acknowledge the possibility at least that consciousness may or may not be as eternal as the energy that drives its mechanical function.<br><br>I&#39;m making one point here, it is unscientific to say that something exists that we have proven unequivocally cannot exist, but it is equally unscientific to say that something does not exist that we have no way of proving dose not exist\u2026despite how unlikely we THINK that it might be\u2026both when preached to a group of people meeting on a certain day of the week would be called religion.", "comment_date": "2015-08-18T21:03:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe T", "comment_text": "Thank you.

I mean I know that they aren&#39;t. Mountains are constantly eroding<br>and in places the crust is melting back into the mantle. Rock obviously isn&#39;t permanent but on the scale of human life, it is and people recognized that fact. Rocks are permanent for thousands of years and I think that&#39;s what makes them important to us. I mean, &quot;a diamond is forever&quot;, we build these monuments to outlast us and our modern structure of metal and glass are just rock refined by our ingenuity. We seek to indentify ourselves with rocks. We carve our heroes in stone because we want them to last forever and there&#39;s a way in which we want that kind of permanence in ourselves too. I think it&#39;s in the core of the desire to scratch our name into stone, put initials in wet cement or fasten a padlock to a bridge. In this way, we try to push our impermanence from our minds. The monuments, the statues and bridges, they give us a sense of continuity. Stability. That this is the way it is and the way it&#39;s always been. Like the first we concieved of stars: static, unchanging, internal. And this way of viewing the world helps us maintain our greatest delusion. The thought tat we are in any way eternal. We want to believe that some part of us, our consciousness or our soul will last forever. But what do you make of it when stone isn&#39;t even permanent? The closest I can ccome to imagining true nothingness is to picture the universe running really fast in reverse. All the galaxies squeezing closer together, stars expanding back into gas clouds and everything getting hotter and denser, compactifying until the whole observable universe could fit into a room and then sinking further into a tiny point and then; nothing. Not the nothingness of empty space but real nothingess which has no size and no time. To me that is probably what death looks like. Nothiness so complete you wouldn&#39;t even miss it. For that, you have to be there. But just as soon as I can form this thought, it evaporates like a void in nature. The world rushes in to fill it and this make sense because the hardware I&#39;m running has been developed over billions of years with the only requriement being that it frequently inaccurately makes copies of itself and would help not inthe slightest in the goal of making copies \u00a0if the hardware could accurately simulate its own non-existence. When we do acknowledge our impermanence, it is through insipid catch phrases like &quot;yolo&quot; or it&#39;s in art projects like Damien Hirst&#39;s &quot;The physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living&quot;. Our sense of our mortality should strike fear into us. The fate of dying stalks us daily but not in this visceral way just in trivial ignorable way. Hence the delusion. You&#39;re permanent like stone. Always and always will be. So we are left hardwired for denial and selected inability to imagine true nothingness. An ephemeral sack sack of particles that thinks itself eternal. \u00a0This delusion is comforting and it makes living easier. It might drive you crazy to be confronted bwith the ultimate meaninglessness of everything all the time, of what we call nihilism. But the same delusion I&#39;d argue is also debilitating. It lulls you into a valse sense of security, inaction like a due date a long time in the future. There&#39;s always tomorrow so we procrastinate living the life we truly desire and we live in more fear. The sense that your soul is eternal makes you cowardly because faulure would stick with you forever. For really ever. Shame, embarassment, disappointment, they would never leave you. A distant horizon encourages you to play it safe. Life to fight another day, for after all there is always another day. And this is why I find nihilism liberating and emboldening. If you can really picture that nothingess that awaits you then what is there to be afraid of? Errors and humiliations will be forgotten but great achiements may not. We may have no meaning in the cosmic context of the universe but we make our own meaning daily with each other and this is the thought that leads to action. Your days are numbered, you don&#39;t know what that number is but it&#39;s finite. So get busy with what it is you want to do.

This sacrifice is called the atonement. The atonement allows us to become and even FEEL clean of all of our sins, weaknesses, and even embarrassments and any other bad thing you can think of. It is what makes it possible us as infant agents (agents as in beings who can make their own choices) to return to God and feel comfortable in his presence, and to eternally become more and more awesome.

But that really depends on which worldview you are talking about. Not all world views have opinions like that, even if yours does. To make a grand blanket statement like that is to do a great disservice to the other world views out there that view eternity in a different light, and it&#39;s not very academic to simply brush them away without explanation or consideration. Some view eternity as a celebration that their shame and mistakes did not overcome them.<br><br>You also say that an eternal world view lures people into the trap of inactivity. Although, while that may be partially true, it&#39;s again a blanket statement. Take the christian world view, they view that eternity is a new journey/exploration of discovery and celebration with their creator, provided they come to know him before death. Most christians find the thought of people being separated from their creator for eternity unbearable, and that spurs them into <b>immense</b> action, travelling to people groups across the world to aid people and spread their news. Whether or not you agree with their world view is irrelevant for your argument, I&#39;m just pointing out it violates the blanket statement you made, and why blanket statements are never helpful or informative.<br><br>Also, as others have mentioned, to say you find meaning in nihilism is a contradiction. According to nihilism, the &quot;meaning&quot; you find in nihilism is a lie that you tell to yourself just to keep yourself going through life, as there is no true meaning, not even the meaning that you make for yourself. Therefore, you are contributing to the great delusion yourself. Deluding yourself into thinking you can craft your own meaning. And that meaning that you do make for yourself is honestly simly limited by income, status, where you live, affluence, etc. So you&#39;re <b>not</b> really free to do what you want at all.\u00a0<br><br>I guess I just think that it&#39;s a little irresponsible to settle on a world view before you&#39;ve taken the time to study, dissect, and analyze all major world views. It&#39;s one of life&#39;s decisions that has the largest and most far-reaching implications, yet people make blanket statements, jump to conclusions, and don&#39;t study and test their options. They just jump into whichever is most convenient for them, regardless if it holds up consistently across all tests.

But then the push from our society pulls me back into the norms and gives me some kind of anxiety. Pressure from things like what a person needs to acomplish in life. But really, I like the way of a nihilist more in a way cause its more realistic. Life IS truly finite and i dont believe in god. I believe when my end of life comes, ill just go into nonexisting. So thats why i feel like you should value the time you have. Do all the cool stuff you see on the internet, visit places and experience the human feelings/emotions. Like hapiness, adrenalin.

Veritasium, I am disappointed in your lack of reason, research, and evidence to back up your claims in this video. I cannot claim that your belief in a meaningless existence doesn&#39;t motivate you in some strange way. But to argue that my view (one held by millions alive today and throughout history) is delusional or debilitating? Was Isaac Newton delusional? he was a devout Christian that believed in a God and our eternal nature. Albert Einstein believed in a creator of the universe and said on multiple occasions &quot;I am not an Atheist&quot; His belief in God was his motivation, he said &quot;I want to know how God created this world, I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details.&quot; They were not held back in their achievements. And they were not the only believing contributors to science and human achievement. I&#39;ll name a few others; Karl Gauss, Galileo (at odds with the church&#39;s false teachings but still a believer),\u00a0Max Planck,\u00a0Leonhard Euler, our founding fathers (George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, etc.) Now you can disagree with these great contributors to mankind and thousands more, but to claim that they are delusional or that their faith did not motivate them. Again that is disappointing to hear from you. I have experienced and Know for myself that my soul is in fact eternal. The knowledge that I have and the knowledge that one can only obtain for ones self, is my motivation. I know that my actions matter, the way that I treat other people matters, whatever experience and knowledge I can gain before I die will give me that much more the advantage in the life to come after my mortal test. furthermore, whatever I can do in my power to elevate those around me and to help them to achieve their best also elevates me in the sight of my Heavenly Father.

How come it doesn&#39;t have any locality within the body? \u00a0Sure if we destroy the brain the awareness goes with it, but we can show that no one part of the brain clearly holds awareness, we can get close sometimes, but it always appears to peak out from some other place when we look for it.\u00a0<br><br>A lot of what I&#39;m saying is conjecture, and borders on &quot;God of the Gaps.&quot; reasoning, except, I am not postulating very much, I am not declaring things to be true as inferred from the things I don&#39;t know. \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>However, I am simply trying to ask the right questions with the right logical/factual foundation. \u00a0 There are a lot of places I and we together can go on this subject.\u00a0<br><br>My gut says that the answer is something very obvious, but utterly not what we think it is... that is, it&#39;s probably not God, it&#39;s probably not oblivion as Derek seams to suggest, but it&#39;s also not permanent or eternal either... Perhaps, like the fundamental laws themselves, this question will never be answered... why is light light, why is kinetic energy kinetic... Why is life life... and death death...\u00a0<br><br>I do however firmly believe (even if unscientifically) that life is energy... Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only changed in form. That doesn&#39;t mean we have a soul, but it can mean we can at least trust that like our atoms, our life energy will propagate into the universe and perhaps be part of new life somewhere someday.\u00a0<br><br>Good video Derek, nothing like a good ole existential crisis to make the mind flow.", "comment_date": "2015-08-18T15:27:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael S", "comment_text": "this reminds me of the depressing thoughts I had when I was little, of how we are really meaningless and helpless in a vast and decaying universe, just particles endowed with an illusion of free will awaiting death", "comment_date": "2015-08-18T15:27:50Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "gradpigodemosviedaff", "comment_text": "Thats really close to what Heidegger said.

Because it limits me to viewing existance in a purely nihilistic fashion. I often see that, after realizing this, i have become more and more welcoming of religion, in any form it may take. However, i cannot seem to start believing in it myself, despite all the advantages that it would bring.\u00a0<br><br>My thoughts deviate a bit from @Veritasium\u00a0though, as i do not believe people today are living like robots. Nor do i believe nihilism is anything but debilitating. Sure, there is less to fear, but what would one fear <b>without</b> nihilism? Ending up in hell? Reincarnating into an insect?<br><br>As with our personal behaviour, i have noticed more that people without religion tend, as mentioned, to persue their own self-interest a lot more. However, this self-interest seems in many cases to be self-destructive. I live in norway, and there are few people here who believe in any gods, and if they do, they do not tend to follow the rules of the religion, but instead use it as a cultural meeting of sorts. That has meant that, at least from my perspective, that people are devoting their life to frivolities - drinking, videogames, entertainment, obsession of self-image, etc. To me, even from a nihilist point of view, that is worth objectivly less than the actions of a society with a non-nihilist point of view. None of these people strive to do anything great. They will make money, entertain themselves, and live the end of their days in much the same way as they did the first ones - with as much food and entertainment as they would like.\u00a0<br><br>I disagree with this static reality, and i have some gut-feeling that i need to do more. I need to have an impact on history. I want to, as the video mentions, be remembered. That is not a preoccupation, that is <b>purpose</b>. Therefore, i devote my life to do anything in my power to attain that purpose. Using admittantly metaphysical reasoning, i have found that my chance of greatness increases if i try to live my life as the ancient philosophers and religious figures wrote one should - working on self-discipline,self-improvement, spiritual and mental excercise, and trying to achieve a prime - being a stoic.

We can&#39;t explain where consciousness comes from, to quote a Harvard neuroscientist, &#39;the best ideas are that consciousness is a network state&#39;, but think about it; a network state of what? Memories, emotion, ideas? How is it that ELECTRICAL IMPULSES of our neurons are able to evoke such complex things? I think it&#39;s evidence of something bigger, of something greater than we can understand. Having the kind of intelligence we have makes us special, we can observe the universe and the life around us, and I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re here to do, whether it&#39;s through art, science, literature, business, math, languages, anything. And I think those that come in the way of that and inflict misery on other humans, kill them or hurt them in any way, hinder them from observing the universe, and they will pay for that. That brings me comfort. I hate to think that all the murders, abuse, rape, theft, and all other injustices that have been committed against people over the years will not amount to any justice because there is no higher meaning to it all and anything more is just a &#39;delusion&#39;.
