We swapped the single-cylinder 3 HP engine for a supercharged 451 Mopar Stroker Short Block with Nitrous Oxide, and it dyno&#39;ed at 873 HP with mad torque at the low end, too.  But don&#39;t think we went cheap-ass on the interior just because it&#39;s an open-top.  Naw, cuz-- we went 100% ermine fur on the seats and floorboard, and custom-fit an ermine sock over the steering handle.  A 1968 Hurst Long Boy shifter replaced that lame-ass throttle bar he&#39;s holding on to.  Time trials showed us we were on the right track: the stock original Benz did the quarter mile in 3 minutes 27.42 seconds.  Pimped, we got that down to 9.1 seconds for real.
