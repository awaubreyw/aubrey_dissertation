It makes absolute clear and toral sense using wave mechanics.  <br>This excerpt from the Theory of Everything (mine, which works, fixes, explains and unifies everything in physics) explains what is actually at work in Bell&#39;s Theorem.<br>Bell&#39;s Theorem is another example of where the mathematics show that it is a wave that is moving through the lattice, it is not particles moving through empty space. Where we have energies, traditionally identified as particles expected at 75% of the total possible energy it is in fact the swell of a wave which at 75% of energy is at 85% of it&#39;s full swell, so the values collected on analysis do not reflect the number of expected particles they in fact represent the number of nodes in the lattice being passed through at 75% of the swell of the oscillating wave. Conversely when the wave is only at 25% its full energy level it has only aquired 15% of its maximum momemtum. <br>In the polarising lenses in the accompanying video the reason why a wave can be totally obscured to darkness when a filter is added and orientated at 90\u00b0 but further filters added between the darkened filter actually brighten it when we intuitively expect more filters would only compound it&#39;s darkness is because the darkened filter is positioned in time and space where the waves that were in phase at the initial filter are out of phase and not visible because they are blocked at the later (darkened) filter.  Adding more filters in between means the waves are propagated at closer to the full swell of the wave so more waves are generated/propagated at closer to full swell so rather than these waves oscillating and decreasing at the later (darkened) filter they never actually appear out of phase, rather instead they are closer to the full swell, that is, the more filters are added at specific angles the more they keep the wave moving at closer to full swell. If we add 3 more filters between the initial filter and a filter orientated at 90\u00b0 which appears dark because the waves from the initial filter are all out of phase then this is what happens.<br>When another filter is added between the darkened filter orientated at 22.5\u00b0 the wave is propagated at 85% of the momentum at the first filter, propagated as a wave at full momentum. Another filter added at 45\u00b0 propagates that wave at 75% of it&#39;s momentum which is 85% of its total swell (which is the square root of 85% of 85\u00b2) which is approximately 78% of the momentum relative to the 1st filter&#39;s momentum rather than 50%.  This in turn is propagated at 85% full momentum which relative to the first filter is 72% (the square root of 85% of 78\u00b2) the initial momentum rather than 15% momentum (or 75% through its progression to it&#39;s trough). So by the time the initial waves arrive at the filter orientated 90\u00b0 they are not all out of phase appearing dark, they are carrying 66.5% (the square root of 85% of 72\u00b2) the momentum of the initial wave rather than 0% as we expect from a wave that is out of phase. <br>The full explanation is in the video on the topic on my channel.

Assuming the particle spins are &quot;entangled&quot; (180 degrees from each other), running the probability of passing through the random filters, and counting up how many times they measure &quot;opposite&quot;... it comes out to 50%. No spooky action needed.<br><br>I re-code to INCLUDE spooky action. That is, the first particle&#39;s angle is randomized, passed through a random filter... and the second particle&#39;s angle is now dependent upon that. For example, particle 1 having some random angle, passing through a 0-degree filter, and measuring &quot;spin up&quot; means particle 2&#39;s angle is now SET (spoooookily) to 180 degrees (opposite of &quot;spin up&quot; for 0-degree filter), passed through a randomly selected filter.... and results compared. ... still 50%<br><br>Fun fact, you also get the same result with more or less filters available to choose from, AS LONG AS they evenly divide the circle. Sooooo, you could even just choose any random angle to use for the filter (being that all angles evenly divide the circle), and you will get the same result.<br><br><br>I think this comes down to the claim in the video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a>. If this has been rigorously tested... and the pairs ALWAYS, 100% of the time measure to be opposite when passed through the same angle filter, therein lies the crux. Because, I simulated this as well, and assuming the probability calculation at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a> is correct 100% of the time, then the probability of the pairs measuring OPPOSITE when passed through the same-angle filter, is actually 75% of the time, UNLESS spooky action is taking place. So, if that&#39;s not reflective of reality, then we have spooky action. No fancy filter swapping is even needed.<br>Can anyone link me to a study that PROVES this? 100% of the time the pairs will measure opposite, given RANDOM (but entangled) spin angle and passed through the same-angle filter?<br>[EDIT]<br>That is, unless the idea of &quot;probability of passing through the filter&quot; is also bunk. Assuming that, given ANY slightly-correlated angle to the filter being passed through causes the photon to align, and this probability calculation is just a simple way of saying &quot;I can&#39;t see it, but it might be in this orientation&quot;, the whole thing&#39;s bunk and determinism remains on the table. I mean... according to the probability calculation, even if the photon is 1-degree off, there&#39;s still a chance the photon will flip a 179 and show up in the opposite orientation.... which....

Plus the fact that we really talk about 3D spin position, resulting in a wide belt like areas with chance of entangled photons choosing the same direction for a particular slot, even though \u201cconventionally\u201d would have to split. Few areas where probability of sticking together for multiple slots at the same time instead of splitting is also quite higher than 0. <br>Probability of going different direction instead of statistically prescribed going together is lower.

It&#39;s also unnecessarily complicated. Imagine a toy car. Looking at the right side the wheel on the right side spins clockwise, looking at the left side the wheel on the left side spins counter. They&#39;re connected by a solid axle. No matter how far apart they are if we see the right wheel spinning clockwise we know the other is spinning counter. If we change the spin of the right the left changes too. Now a wrinkle. Put the wheels in a box like Schrodinger&#39;s cat&#39;. We don&#39;t know which way the wheels are spinning. 50/50 chance of finding a particular direction when we open the box to look. But we can&#39;t open the box. so we attach a magnet to the wheels. Pass the box by a magnet outside of the box, and we can tell from that which way the wheel is spinning. But the next time we do that it has a 50/50 chance of being found to be spinning the other way. So we know which way it was spinning before the measurement but don&#39;t know which way it&#39;s spinning after the measurement. The passing of the magnet changes the spin. So we pass the magnet a random number of times changing the spin randomly. But when we look at the other wheel it&#39;s spin is opposite. But connected by a solid axle that&#39;s what we would expect. But if the axle is long the change of spin of one wheel that was subjected to the passing magnet can&#39;t go down the axle faster than light. That violates light speed limit. So until the change gets to the other wheel they may both be spinning the same direction. Violation of conservation. So they can&#39;t be changing their directions as a result of a connection. The third alternative is they are not connected at all. They are just coincidentally opposite. No more connected than one coin flip probability 50/50 is connected to another. But the universe wouldn&#39;t work without these opposites. But there are opposites in just a fingernail as if coincidentally you flipped billions of heads in a row. The opposites in the entire universe is like flipping trillions of trillions to the power of 600 heads in a row. Here opens the door to the multiverse. With an infinite number of universes it&#39;s inevitable some (an infinity of them) would have coincidentally trillions of trillions to the power of 600 heads in a row. That is the only answer that doesn&#39;t violate conservation or the speed of light. Here another mind boggler.

One objection is the testing of entangled particles.  At minute <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&amp;t=4m31s\">4:31</a> of this video, you mention that &quot;pairs of entangled particles will be sent to the two detectors&quot; for testing.  My question is: How do you know the two particles you are sending to the detectors are entangled?  Not all particles are entangled.  In fact, it is my impression (if I understand correctly) that no entangled particles have ever been found.  (Or have they?)  If two entangled particles have been located for the purpose of such a test, how were they found?  And how do you know these two particles are actually entangled?  (Or did such testing never even take place with actual entangled particles, but the testing is nothing more than a mathematical calculation based on what one believes they might find?)<br><br>Another objection I have is that quantum entanglement implies that exerting force on one entangled particle would move both entangled particles by the same amount, even though only one of the particles was acted upon by the force.  This violates a fundamental law of physics that the amount of work obtained is always equal to the amount of force applied.  You cannot apply a force of &quot;A&quot; on an object and get the work equivalent of &quot;2A&quot; of force.  (What I mean is:  Your hardest push on a sofa moves it 1 meter forward.  You tie 2 sofas together.  Your hardest push will not move both sofas 1 meter forward, but only 0.5 meter, since the force of your push would be divided in half by each sofa.)  Quantum entanglement implies getting double the work output for your input, giving you one workload output for free, which violates the laws of physics.  If you exert enough force on particle 1 to move it 1 meter, then 2 particles that are entangled could move only 0.5 meter each; they cannot both move 1 meter each, for you cannot get work for free.", "comment_date": "2021-07-20T15:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Trotter", "comment_text": "First, I must say that I really like your videos.  Very informative and very well done.  Thumbs up and I&#39;m a subscriber.<br><br>The simplest explanation for why we can&#39;t use the  &quot;spooky-action-at-a-distance&quot; or FTL communication between entangled particles is that it doesn&#39;t exist.  Two particles interact, move away from each other to distant detectors, and the results are correlated in a way that conforms to conservation law.  This seems very much like what happens with, say, colliding billiard balls.  Except that, prior to detection, what we&#39;re calling particles might be waves, i.e., disturbances in media of unknown substance and structure.  So, let&#39;s suppose that.<br> \r<br>Let&#39;s further suppose that these waves are continually changing in form, and therefore really don&#39;t have any particular &quot;spin&quot; value while they&#39;re heading for the detectors.  Nevertheless, they will still be related by conservation law.  In experiments designed to produce opposite values for timestamp-correlated detections, isn&#39;t referring to a relationship due to mutual interaction and application of conservation law enough to obviate the need for them to be communicating in some FTL or spooky way?  Relationships of this sort don&#39;t care about distance.<br><br>I&#39;m somewhat familiar with Bell&#39;s stuff.  Violation of Bell inequalities can be used to indicate the presence of entanglement.  I think it&#39;s a mistake to say that Bell has shown that hidden variables don&#39;t exist or that any deeper level of modelling quantum phenomena (i.e., hidden variable models) has been proven impossible.  Since there&#39;s currently no way to know what&#39;s happening at the level of quantum phenomena, between emitters and detectors, and current models are somewhat inadequate, then (per Bell himself) maybe we just need to be more imaginative.", "comment_date": "2021-07-20T13:20:57Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Adam Pawlicki", "comment_text": "Hold on.

That is some pretty poor aim and consistency from that gun.  Do we know that the particles aren&#39;t getting &quot;deflected&quot; by hitting the edges?  Throwing tennis balls would produce concentrations of hits directly behind the gap as well as to both sides where the ricochet from balls hitting the edge would land, with a fairly empty space in between those areas. (unless intentionally throwing diagonally, which is defeating the purpose)  I believe the model is wrong and prevents understanding the true nature because we are limiting interpretations with false assumptions.  I&#39;m sure I sound like an idiot to &quot;experts&quot; in this area and I am fine with that because all new understandings are dismissed offhandedly by the current paradigm.  I don&#39;t have the new answers, but I refuse to ignore the giant gaping questions that the old answers leave.  <br>The best analogy I can come up with for all this is that the Universe is pure analog/gradient and we are trying to model it digitally/&quot;quantumly&quot;.  We enforce a discrete model because it fits our interpretation of mathematics, but the universe existed before we came up with ways to measure it and has no obligation to fit into our ideas of structure and pattern.  It may be something as simple as the &quot;missing variables&quot; or FTL information exchanges existing/occurring in a dimension that we do not have access to  - and I think that might actually be one of the theories out there...  It only appears that there are separate packets because the connections between them are hiding behind a veil, in a dimension we can&#39;t perceive... <br>I have tried to understand these things for decades and watched so many videos and read many articles but all it does is make me frustrated and something inside screams &quot;no no no no that&#39;s not right&quot;, but I can&#39;t quite explain what or why.

say we measure at the other observer that particle 1 is spin up, and therefore we observe at observer B that particle 2 is spin down. <br><br>i\u2019m not sure that it works like this, but i do believe if we have the ability to observe a particle at a certain time this can be used for a signal. obviously observer B can look at particle 2 whenever, but timing is important. <br>the point i\u2019m making here is that we could send a signal at a particular time by taking an output from observer B as it detects that particle 2 is spin down, but we wouldn\u2019t have to actually be there making the observer detect that, because we have set observer B to only detect when it knows what the spin is, not to find it out by looking at a particle in quantum entanglement. <br><br>so as a result that observer B gives an output at the same time that we detect the spin of particle 1 at observer A, lightyears away (for example) and we have given an instantaneous signal. <br><br>say, for the final point, that observer B turns on a light when it sees that it KNOWS what the spin of particle 2 is (note, not when it looks to work it out, but when it is told. i wi reiterate the idea is we have to have made the technology to be able to detect when a particle is definitely spin up or down, and yet still not be able to detect the spin of the particle on its own) it can then be activated simply by measuring what particle 1\u2019s spin is. <br><br>applying that, the light turns on when we measure particle 1 at observer A, and that is lightyears away from that light. meaning we have sent a signal instantaneously, faster than the speed of light\u2026<br><br>relativity theory needs to be debunked soon, there needs to be a theory that TRULY satisfies both and i hope to one day achieve that. but that\u2019s not some easy task and maybe i have no idea what i\u2019m talking about because i\u2019m just a kid in school i don\u2019t know what i want to do with my life. i just love science.<br><br>anyway help me out to understand why this doesn\u2019t work, thanks, i don\u2019t know anything i\u2019m not pretending i\u2019m some scientist this is just my understanding and it doesn\u2019t work with the relativity theory. thanks :)", "comment_date": "2021-06-25T00:51:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mattyy101", "comment_text": "Einsteins theory has been disproven", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T21:08:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nameth A", "comment_text": "It ain\u2019t true , what if dark matter counter act for conservation of angular momentum", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T03:32:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Entropic Blackhole", "comment_text": "well instead of measuring the particles measure the delay between two of them, since they are random we couldn&#39;t be able to communicate faster than light, but if we measure the delay between them, no matter the outcome, we would still get the same message, on planet A, someone sends a message to planet B, via entangled particles, however on planet B, they measure the delay between particle that is measured, lets say particle 1 gets measured, and has spin up, 2 gets measured and has spin down, 2 was measured one second after 1 was measured, we use time as the way of communicating, ofc this would probably be with picoseconds and not seconds, but you would have the fastest internet in a far far away galaxy", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T18:06:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SneakySnitch", "comment_text": "This Is the First Time I Hear That their spins are Not exactly the opposite to each other\u2026", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T14:16:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt M", "comment_text": "Still confused as to why this can&#39;t be used for communication.", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T13:24:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Archana Kumari", "comment_text": "Our successors,who forgot about us,better not see this as mysticism.", "comment_date": "2021-06-21T19:20:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabe Shaw", "comment_text": "So it violates conservation of angular momentum not relativity?", "comment_date": "2021-06-21T02:48:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Janik M\u00fcller", "comment_text": "what do you mean by spin up or down???

Just not DIRECT communication. For example, make some special discs or drives that have quantumly entangled particles in the EXACT same order. Assign either up or down as a bit, 1 or 0. Then, every day, or every week or month (same time frame schedule) at the exact same time, change which way the particle is read so that the other particle in the other disc will be an up spin or down spin. This will crate a string of entangled particles in the other matching entangled disc. Then, AFTER the first disc is written, READ the spin of the particles in the second disc and Viola! You just downloaded a bit string! This can be a message or news article or whatever. Then, send one disc into space and the other disc stays on earth. AS SOON as the discs are written, the other disc will have matched particles that theoretically should change their spin according to how the same particles in order on earth were instantly. So every day at the same time you can get a new message! Or send a message back! But only once per read per disc.... bummer. One a disc is used that&#39;s it. It&#39;s useless. You need a new disc for every message and can&#39;t change the message &quot;written&quot; on a &quot;used&quot; disc because once the particle is measured it remains the same. And the time it takes to &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; a disc would take forever and we don&#39;t have the technology to arrange entangled particles in a precise order or read them so accurately. I would take huge, expensive and heavy machines to read these discs. And use can only use a disc to download a message once so you need a lot of discs. Not to mention the discs mus be read IN ORDER every timing event and if the timing is off by only a second, reading a disc before the &quot;sending&quot; disc is finished will ruin both entangled discs.

And If it sends this second pulse it means the information is wrong so it turns the 0 to a 1. But if the particle on the receiving computer comes out 1 (which is correct) then the other computer does nothing. So if you wanted to say \u201cyes\u201d the computer would either receive 0(1/0) or just 1. If you wanted a whole message sending then you could just space the signals out using timing, sort of like morse code, so that the signals don\u2019t get confused. Although I supposed you\u2019d need a ridiculous amount of particles seen as how you can\u2019t reuse them. And those particles would have to have been close together to start with anyway so it\u2019s probably not exactly practical, but... It\u2019s still possible right? Unless I\u2019m missing some obvious flaw. If it is possible I guarantee someone has already thought of it, it\u2019s just at the end of the video he said it would be impossible to commutate a message. But surely that would work? Can someone with a brain explain if I&#39;m wrong?", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T12:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "targan hunter", "comment_text": "The wry july inexplicably tremble because swedish immuhistochemically relax inside a powerful quarter. protective, imported distance", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T13:15:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "idan hacmon", "comment_text": "My line of thought was obliterated when i saw spinning Dereks", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T12:32:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Noblin", "comment_text": "As mass goes faster, time slows down.

Now, imagine that the ice cube is a tuning fork. If the tuning fork passed over an object emitting the same frequency, the tuning fork would begin to vibrate like the model of sympathetic vibration.

It&#39;s not a natural, intuitive structure. After a while, you get into areas where the math holds up, but reality is different. Like dividing by zero, for example. It&#39;s like how languages are used to convey info; words are attributed to certain things and ideas, but those words are not naturally directly proportional to what they mean. The word &quot;ladder&quot; had to have been invented at some point, but someone who speaks no language would not inherently know what that word means. Math is the same; it describes values and interactions between those values, but it&#39;s all a construct people made to interpret and properly track those values and interactions.

This is, proof that the universe cannot be both &quot;Local&quot; AND &quot;Realistic.&quot;  &quot;Local&quot; in the physicists&#39; usage means that nothing can affect a particle (really, the state of the particle) except something, a force, a field, another particle, that is in direct contact with the particle.  All effects happen only from causes that are perfectly local, not causes at some distance away.  And &quot;Realistic&quot; means the universe is what it is (hate that expression, but we can use it here), and while we may not always see or understand every aspect of it correctly, it none the less does exist, has reality, and only one reality, even when we don&#39;t see/understand its reality correctly, or don&#39;t see it at all.  The basic tests of quantum entanglement convincingly demonstrated to modern physics, with no real doubt now, that Local-Realistic theories cannot be correct.  Either Localism must break down, that is to say that TRUE action at a distance happens, or Realism must break down, at quantum scales.  (Or, that both break down.)  Using both the standard polarization of light photons (i.e., photon spin, with spin as described in this video), and using circular polarization of the same photons (which is also either left-circular, or right-circular) Leon Lederman (Nobel Prize in Physics,1988) expanded on Bell&#39;s Test in order to test whether it was Locality that is breaking down, or Realism.  Or both.  I think he proposed his Locality or Realism test earlier, but the experiments were done like 2010-2012 or so I think (?).  Result:  (not fully accepted by all, but no one seems to have any other reasonable explanations) is that BOTH Locality AND Realism must break down, that is, neither is a construct of our universe at quantum scales.  So, Leon says sorry, but that electron you thought you measured, &quot;saw,&quot; used in a circuit, and fully believed in, is not real in the human sense that we use that word.  E.g., it really is NOT &quot;there.&quot;  If you think that it is some specific where, it&#39;s not.

When we observe entangled particles they break their connection with another particle if it can be located at the other end of the universe. It is possible that photons consisting of entangled particles when we observe them we break their connection between them and so the photons continue their true path, otherwise when we do not observe them more accurately we do not break their connection and they react opposite to their partner moving opposite direction from him. This theory of mine explains why photons behave the way they do when observed and when not without being taken into consideration theory of superdeterminism or the theory of probability theory, it also explains that light is not a wave but particles. Taking this theory into account, we can see where the photons end up in such a way as to determine the location of their counterpart.<br>This is just hypothesis!<br>I am not a physicist nor am I a scientist but if you think this theory might make sense and can contribute to today\u2019s scientists any help I ask you to share this or if you know someone who is engaged in science to show him this!", "comment_date": "2020-07-13T13:27:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I I", "comment_text": "I found entanglement an interesting enough theory, until watching dude spin around like a top most of the vid", "comment_date": "2020-07-13T09:59:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pratik Raut", "comment_text": "The act of understanding quantum entanglement, makes it misunderstanding.", "comment_date": "2020-07-13T09:52:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pnguyena512", "comment_text": "whos here becuase of DARK?", "comment_date": "2020-07-13T07:56:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Fella", "comment_text": "Jada been doing some spooky action at a distance.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T16:28:41Z", "likes_count": 135}, {"comment_by": "ce666isa", "comment_text": "Gawd damn slow down i just wanted to know what did jada pinket smith mean by entanglement", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T16:24:30Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Black Eagle", "comment_text": "I&#39;m here because of the Outer Wilds...", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T12:38:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T", "comment_text": "When this nigga said they were opposite random I accepted defeat.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T09:12:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T", "comment_text": "Did I stumble into a YouTube channel made just for geniuses or are there other idiots like me here?", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T09:08:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sunset Club", "comment_text": "Is this what Jada was talking about?", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T03:21:36Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "Eitan K", "comment_text": "Am i the only one who got lost?", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T02:17:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Saunchegraw", "comment_text": "Me too.

I have always been fascinated by computers, starting in 1972 using a prototype Cogar 4 that my dad got his hands on, when I was 3. By the time I was 5 Singer wanted to use me in a commercial to sell the computer, because if a 5 yo could start it, load the OS and then load games, that proved anyone could. My first mentor helped develop Ethernet after working for my father, and allowed me to hold one of the first breadboard ethernet cards developed when I was 10. My first real program (programming since at least 5 if you count the Cogar ASM I had to type to get to the OS and games) was in BASIC that I learned from a manual without anything more than a small example for each command, written with pencil on paper: a rudimentary AI demonstration called &quot;Animals&quot;. I first professionally programmed in 1982, started building computers and networks for a small computer company in 1986 owned by my second mentor, Peter De Blanc who lead ICANN for a period, was an official beta tester and developer for OS/2 2.0 and developed a device driver for it for the extremely complex Truevision Targa+ 64 video editing board (pic: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/hMe21Qe\">https://imgur.com/a/hMe21Qe</a> ) directly flipping bits on it in 1991. My experience has only gone up from there. Here is something I found, that I have never seen anything like even searching for it on the Internet for the past 20 years:<br><br>What if there is something more basic to the universe than math? I propose a &quot;Dynamic Stateless Computer&quot; that operates on &quot;Logic Geometry&quot; based only on connections, or links, or pointers - a much more simple computer than the three basic Boolean logic gates operating on mathematical binary bits that is every computer out there. The shape is the logic and the logic is the shape. <br><br>From what I understand they are forcing current quantum computers to unnaturally apply a binary state to something that has a infinite evolution of states. Think of the electron and the circle it makes around a nucleus. That 360 degrees circle it makes is infinite in precision, and that movement certainly has an effect on its surroundings. Basically, math is the descriptive language of the universe, and not the actual universe because it uses measurements.<br><br>Quantum mechanics is beyond me, but if this only needs connections, ie a quantum entanglement, can we build a computer that operates and does its entire run instantly? Like I said, all I need is connections to perform logic... no need for information... the shape is the logic.<br><br>You are best off going to Github and seeing online without downloading the paper and models. When someone looked at my calculators, they accused me of: &quot;You&#39;re not doing math! You&#39;re emulating math!&quot; Look at the simple calculator first, it only does addition and subtraction. Then look at the complex calculator that does multiplication and division.  As you well know, if I can do those things, I can do anything mathematically. In the main model I created if-thens, complex do-whiles, a randomizer and a relational database.

In order to be spooky, the measurements must be space-like, meaning that they cannot be connected by a light signal.

It the observer is traveling in the direction from measurement A to measurement B (and not necessarily between A and B), she will conclude, using relativity, that B happened first. But someone going the other way will conclude A happened first. So neither A nor B can be said to be first, so they&#39;re can&#39;t be any communication between A and B at the time of measurement. And since the experimenter at either end can rotate her analyzer&#39;s direction <i>after</i> the particles separate without losing the spooky correlations, it is truly spooky.

Now this alone tells you that the &#39;spin&#39; of the object is NOT encoded in the particle itself. An up particle can obviously be converted into a down particle and vice versa. So, yes this experiment shows that the spin is NOT permanently encoded in the particle to serve as the &quot;hidden variable&quot;.  But what we are doing by measuring the spin at different angles, is to completely change the spin, so we get the 50% chance that is observed due to the resetting of the state, thus removing the &quot;hidden variable&quot; in this experiment. So the result can be explained as an &#39;artifact&quot; of the experimental setup, not because we tell if there is a hidden variable or not. There is a hidden variable, but that can only be properly recovered if the detector is always in the same orientation as when it was created. In that case, we always trivially recover a 100% matching rate. If quantum entanglement were true, then there would be instances where if we observe an up spin, there is a probability that the other particle will also be up spin, because the state was indeterminate.

The only thing that is inadequate is the tools to measure and the ability to analyze the data. Einstein is right, by using simple common sense. The experiment that the guy claims has proved Einstein wrong, actually doesn&#39;t prove anything at all, in my opinion. All it proves to me is that we don&#39;t understand spin, and that what we are observing is probably not real phenomena. He doesn&#39;t tell us that this idea of spin is actually only conjecture, and that humans have no real reason to believe that subatomic particles actually have a real angular momentum or positioning in space. All we have is mathematics that predict energy states, and we have phenomena that occurs when a magnetic field is introduced to the system. We can&#39;t see these particles. We can&#39;t tell if they have physical properties. And we definitely don&#39;t know what any type of spin would be like concerning them. We don&#39;t even know if they occupy an actual point in space at any given time, at least not one that we can measure. All we have is measurements that we postulate on. I say common sense wins here. <br><br>He said &quot;if you measure each particle horizontally, there is a 50% chance of both having the same spin.&quot; Well of course there is because you already told us that when you measure horizontally, all particles have a 50% chance of being up or down, even if you remeasure the same particle. Now we are just basing this on what we feeble minded humans even mean by  a &quot;horizontal&#39; measurement. So based on this way of thinking it makes sense that two spontaneously generated particles will have the same spin 50% of the time if you measure both of them horizontally. horizontal doesn&#39;t force them to show their actual spin! horizontal probably knocks a up spin down sometimes and knocks a down spin up. Essentially its a stupid way to measure something that only spins up or down.  So essentially the whole premise for this idea that there is an undefined spin is because you can get 50% variability in spin when you measure the thing horizontally?? what happened to the clear and obvious data that shows when you measure the particle in an up or down direction you don&#39;t get any variability?? How bout we just throw out the stupid data gained by measuring the spin horizontally or even at a 60 degree slant since there is no practical or mathematical reason to do that. I mean it is just so silly to me. I&#39;m not a genius, but you don&#39;t have to be a genius to come to Einstein&#39;s conclusion. The guy in the video proves himself wrong with his last argument that quantum mechanics explains the 50% result.  &quot;if particle A is down, then particle B has 2/3 x 3/4 chance of being up&quot;. Well if you measured them only up and down it would be 100% chance of being up. Measuring a particle sideways or slanted is going to cause something you can&#39;t predict, because there is something(as Einstein already said) intrinsic about the particle that makes it behave slightly random if its measured on an angle. So why measure it at an angle? The same math you used to arrive at 50% also proves that it will be 100% if you omit that data, so how does this prove Einstein wrong???? Einstein based his conclusion on up and down measurement, which is the only measurement which seems to nail down an intrinsic and fully predictable quality of the particle spin. Not trying to bang a particle through a slanted opening(I know its not physically what happens). I think scientist as just bored now, since technology hasn&#39;t advanced enough for them to understand or observe anything further on the physical nature of sub atomic particles, so they are going off in sci-fi land to entertain themselves. Its all proven by the fact that there is no practical application of what these quantum people are claiming. Oh great so we can teleport stuff or information right?? Oh actually no, cuz uh....well....we can&#39;t predict what will come out the other side.....But there is a connection to the other side.....however the connection changes mid way...somehow....<br><br>Sorry I don&#39;t buy any of this and I&#39;m going to stick with Einstein on this one.

According to QM if  the two entagled particles are measured along the same axis, one will be spin up and the other spin down. When counting, therefore, it should be checked if that really occurs. Assuming that entanglement, as described by QM, is real, it is enough that 10 % of the measured particles have lost their entanglement during the flight to compromise the results of the experiment.<br>Finally, as far as I have understood, EPR did not believe to the entanglement. It is easy to demonstrate that with random particles, the relut will be 50/50.<br>I frankly believe that physicists have gone on the way of philosophy. They want to demonstrate that in the universe there is no space for a God. QM, as per mainstream interpretation, leads to two possible conclusions: 1) even particles have free will or 2) everything is superdeterministic. Both of them do not leave any space for a God.  Now, I am absolutely not sure if there is a God, but I do not exclude there is. General Relativity leads to the Big Bang and, at the zero point, we cannot say anything more.

Einstein did not accept the Copenhagen interpretation, so that a particle can be +1 and -1 at the same time till the moment it is measured and that the act of measuring it collapses it to +1 (or -1) so immediately influencing the entangled one with a spooky action at a distance. If that was the case there should have been a &quot;hidden variable&quot;.<br>2) Therefore, it is more correct to say that we do not know in advance if a particle is +1 or -1 till the moment we measure it and that there will be a certain distribution, say 50/50. It&#39;s the same that sayng that when I wake up I do not know the outside temperature till I measure it, I can just say that it will likely be X plus minus Y, given where I am and the season. But the outside temperature is already there even before I measure it. It is not in a superposition of states before my measure. That is true for any type of measure we do. We can look at a person and say that is approximately 1.80 mt. tall if we can compare with something of known height, but if we look at that person at a distance in the middle of a flat desert, we do not have any idead before that person comes close to us. For a particle it is the same. Before we measure it, it&#39;s a person in the middle of the desert, it could be 1.40 as well as 2.20, but most likely 1.70-1.80 (let&#39;s assume it is an adult male). <br>3) In the moment the two entangled particles ar generated, we simply do not have any tool to know before the measure which one is +1 and which one -1 (or up and down), we do not have any tool to control the generation process. But one will be +1 and the other -1, and that will be since their generation.  In the same way wehen we take some snow and make a ball, we do not know its precise weight before measuring it because, with our hand, we do not have the capabilities to make it of a precisely defined weight. <br>4) The way the experiment is designed will in any case provide a 50 % distribution and not a 5/9. The 5/9 would be the result if the particles had a &quot;list of instructions&quot;, but that is not obvioulsy the case.  It&#39;s just a matter of trigonometry to demonstate that, if we measure two entangled particles that could have any random spin, but one opposite to the other, along 3 directions that are rotated 120\u00b0, wel we will obtain a 50/50 distribution. It would be like being at a casino and observing baccarat players. when they get a 5 they will randomly decide to stay or to call, we have no way to know it in advance, but it will likely be 50/50.<br>6) Not knowing, being unable to predetermine the status is different than saying that the very act of measurement  defines the status of particles if the generation process is random. And, by the way, the act of measurement is obviously modifying the statys of the partcle because it iterfere with other particles", "comment_date": "2019-12-12T09:50:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ahmad Jan", "comment_text": "Very interesting", "comment_date": "2019-12-11T16:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Shen", "comment_text": "Therapist: Don&#39;t worry, shuriken derek isn&#39;t real, he can&#39;t hurt you<br><br>Shuriken derek: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&amp;t=5m06s\">5:06</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-11T12:05:42Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "straightedgerc", "comment_text": "Any entanglement demonstration involving a choice illustrates that the subjective experience of scientist A making a choice, only he knows, violates locality as observed by scientist B, and so the subjective experience of scientist A does not occur in a finite box.\u00a0 Therefore, the human mind cannot be said to be inside a finite box such as the brain, the brain and body, or the body and the local environment regardless of how entanglement works.", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T19:53:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Abhinav Is", "comment_text": "How do we know which particles are entangled", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T15:07:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZZ-T", "comment_text": "It&#39;s called FREE WILL, my dear : D.

I just wrote a comment about this on another subject but the took mother rabbits down in submarines, and thousands of miles away.  Then, with extremely accurate clocks, (I need to look up what kind of clocks these were) but at the command of someone not directly involved, they&#39;d kill the children bunnies, and the rabbits in the submarines had brain wave recorders on clocks synced with the surface clocks.  The mother&#39;s brain waves recorded an absolutely simultaneous and abnormal spike at the time it&#39;s children were killed in some instantanious way so they could prove that they were not only connected by some means that was not understood but was also faster than light.  Now, I&#39;m not sure I believe the faster than light bit, but the simultaneous nature of the connection is intriguing.  That&#39;s why I remember it.  It&#39;s definitely not a physical connection.  How was this event communicated?  That&#39;s the weird thing.  Many mother&#39;s report to just &quot;knowing&quot; when something happened to their child.  So the rabbit experiment was triple blind and under the ocean at great depth and it was repeated on so many, and only the mother who&#39;s children were killed, would register this spike is brain waves and behavioral disturbance thereafter for some time.  I&#39;m not sure how long it took a rabbit to get over that trauma.  But then they&#39;d do it with the next rabbit.  Those on the submarines had no idea when these events occured.  They only reported their behavior in general.  They didn&#39;t even know why they had rabbits aboard a submarine.  So it&#39;s a very interesting repeated experiments, though very cruel,  Do not try this at home.  (Nor in your nuclear submarine.)  But, is this an example of some type of communication that is somehow a practical example of quantum entanglement?  We know at one time, the children of it&#39;s mother were produced in the same womb from cells grown within the mother.  So there are molecules like DNA that were at one time, part of it&#39;s mother.  I&#39;m at a loss for words now.  Something must explain this.  Then there&#39;s this theory.  Could they be linked?  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m smart enough to make an experiment that could decide this one way or another.  It&#39;s just one of many fringe type phenomena that defy explanation even though the overall experiment is accepted, like remote viewing and maybe others,  water dowsing?  I&#39;m not sure if there is a list of accepted, proven beyond all doubt, anyone could replicate, just replace the submarine with space, or just distance alone.  That&#39;s fact.  I read the remote viewing book in the 70s that was a breakthrough announcement at the time.  The fact of it as a phenomenon is confirmed by science worldwide, and repeatable anywhere.

Even when we observe an object from two different points we can see they APPEAR to be spinning opposite because it is relative to our perspective. The North and South pole for example.  Are we as individual observing them both at the same time?  Well, if these paired particles were at both location, then YES we would translate this information Subconsciously.

When it comes to variables, modern scientists need a drool bucket to comprehend. Like, the bending of gravity..... They dont even take in consideration that known anomaly are In FACT cheating light speed. Hell, gamma even passes through matter and does not abide by the same laws, which could bypass ripples in space light cannot. Is this the limitations these Masters Degree offer?

The way the conservation of angular momentum is applied to the universe. <br>      If this is a theoretical experiment only then our experiment breaks one or more natural laws to start off, specifically the creation of mass, and so of course there will be other incompatibilities with natural laws to balance this out.  The equation<br>Angular Momentum = Mass * Angular Velocity <br>is used as a definition and means to determine angular momentum.  It should be clear that if you keep mass and angular velocity the same then the momentum should stay the same. However when we change the mass the angular velocity will change as well. We can apply this logic to the &quot;system of the universe&quot; as well<br>Angular Momentum of Universe = the sum of (all the masses in the universe * their respective angular velocities)<br>If from one moment to the next the any mass is added or removed the total of the angular momentum of the Universe need not remain constant. To summarize if we create a pair of  masses  from nothing it doesn&#39;t have to sum to no net angular momentum.<br>This can be bypassed by having a mass with no angular momentum relative our reference point and dividing it into 2 equal mass parts with some angular momentum. According to the law of conservation of angular momentum the 2 parts would have equal magnitude and opposite sign/direction angular momentum. Assuming the direction is unknown and random we can proceed with the thought experiment. <br><br><br>2. an inaccurate measurement (the spin measurement of a particle&#39;s spin when the spin is actually perpendicular to the direction of measurement) does not change the spin of the particle as is claimed in this video. This would only be possible if the measurement process or device changed the direction, which invalidates the process because a change to one particle does not affect another non connected particle even if it previously was identical in all ways except spin direction. <br><br><br>3. causation is being attributed to the second particle&#39;s spin when it really is correlation. One event caused both the spins rotation.<br><br><br>4. treating probabilities as absolutes. If the probability of a particle spinning on an axis 60\u00b0 from the angle of measurement being attributed to the closer axis is 3/4 and the probability of it being attributed to the further axis is 1/4 then the probability of a particle spinning the opposite way on the same axis retaliative to the measurement taken being attributed to the opposite axis of the first particle which we will call Pc can be determined using the following equation<br>Pc=Pa\u00b2+(1-Pa)\u00b2<br>where Pa is the probability of the first particle&#39;s spin being attributed to the closer axis, and the probability of the second particle&#39;s spin being attributed to the axis closest to it&#39;s spin would be the same because of the same distance from the measurement. Pa*Pb is the chance both will assign to the closest, (1-Pa)*(1-Pb) is the chance both assign to the further axis. B plugging in the equations above the probability we are looking for is .625. If we want to get the average probability for any angle we would need to integrate this equation (putting back in the sub equation P=cos\u00b2(\u03a6/2)) over the change in angle and account for 3 dimensional space. This would come out something like <br>       \u2320\u03a6=180\u00b0 <br> P= \u2502              (2\u03c0*cos(\u03a6)\r*(  (cos\u00b2(\u00ad\u03a6/2)\r)\u00b2  +  (1-cos\u00b2(\u00ad\u03a6/2)\r)\u00b2  ),  \u03a6)<br>       \u2321\u03a6=0\u00b0<br>I haven&#39;t done this sort of math in a long time so I may have messed it up. If you actually care I recommend deriving it yourself.<br><br><br>5. when testing spin from 3 different angles  you assumed because the % result differed from the % expected result based on the probability analysis you rejected the idea of having a singular existing spin. This is a problem because you did not present any statistical significance for the findings. If the test was only done 10 times it would not be unreasonable to get a 50% result. Without providing statistical significance (the probability that the actual results of an infinite number of tests or the entire population would be within some offset range of the sample results, it should look like &quot;from the results the average is 50% with a 95% confidence interval of \u00b12%) without statistical significance it is wrong to reject the idea.<br><br><br>6. when calculating the probability of the set of tests presented with 3 angles of measurement and predetermined results for each of the 3 measurements not all the probabilities were given the same weight. there are 8 different sets of predetermined spin possible. The 5/9 number came from the probability of the 2 Up 1 down and its equivalent probabilities, this leaves out the all up and all down possibilities. there are actually 72 equally likely different combinations (8 possible predeterminations multiplied by 9 different orientations of measuring) and 48  result in opposite measurements. This means about 2/3 of the pairs measured should show opposite spin if the theory is to be supported. However if there is any inaccuracy in the measuring devises that can add error, and there will be a random error because this is a sample that error can be reduced with more trials (it increases the confidence in the result and/or narrows the confidence interval)", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T12:28:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Skill Up", "comment_text": "I understood everything up to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&amp;t=00m01s\">00:01</a>", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T11:57:01Z", "likes_count": 1996}, {"comment_by": "tzunammi shadai", "comment_text": "The particles contain secret information that I still am not privy to... %100 of the time no matter in what direction they are being measured in spin up or spin down. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sheeeeesh\">#sheeeeesh</a>", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T13:04:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Guevara", "comment_text": "So does quantum entanglement have something to do with the 4th dimension?", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T05:40:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Samuel White", "comment_text": "Do you have some fetish for pretending to be small particles?", "comment_date": "2019-07-04T21:18:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HTrinity", "comment_text": "In 50% of my dreams I understood this all \ud83d\ude2e lol", "comment_date": "2019-07-04T08:42:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Financial Gyaan", "comment_text": "I loved it.", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T20:37:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tibor", "comment_text": "Spooky action at distance : When memes propagate without a medium", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T17:34:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alkabai sahu", "comment_text": "entangle his ass", "comment_date": "2019-07-03T14:48:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan SP", "comment_text": "Is the entanglement properties the same as perhaps the opposite corner of a square?

According to this video a pair of photons or something is sent through two detectors and we can measure the spin of one particle and know that the spin of the other is opposite.  But as soon as we measure the spin of the one (say A) the other one(B) is not known any more because it can&#39;t measure the change we made?  If reading alters the superposition of B rather than fixing it to a known position.  (Well that doesn&#39;t make sense, so it must be falling to a state opposite of A)  <br><br><br>Once we measure it the other particle will not have the same original orientation it had before, superposition lost?  Some say that.  But it&#39;s position is fixed as one position.  We can&#39;t measure that it&#39;s superposition was altered?  The B stream seems to be a B superposition and we don&#39;t know it was fixed?    Perhaps this is what is happening once the position is read, the paired opposite string is read somewhere else, but they never can tell it&#39;s randomness was fixed by an earlier read or other read.  Perhaps that means a way we could not know if we were distant and didn&#39;t know the measurement was being taken.  Maybe I can put it in an example so people can see it.<br><br><br>Okay let&#39;s say we are using a some kind of quantum beam splitter or generator and over time, lets just say our configuration is setup so photons are arriving at two sets of detectors at the same time.  This seems to be how they were explaining two detectors from a common entangled pair.  So we are splitting the photon pairs so they will appear in two places.  Now I&#39;m using this as a more simple explanation not to get statistical reality of the difference but just for setting the spin in a simple up and down way.  In other words, an up and down way with a &quot;theoretical two slit polarizer that only can see  up or down&quot;.  I don&#39;t care about the third direction as that&#39;s just trying to say more data is needed to prove the difference between spooky action and random packed information?   or whatever. I may be missing something here.<br><br><br>So let&#39;s say for example we split two quantum entangled pairs from a series of pairs in a digital stream of positive or negative byte streams.  Up and down spins are measured.  They both have superpositions before we measure them,  so lets say the A stream turns out like this 10001001,  once it&#39;s read.  Okay I know the randomness of the stream here shows more zeros or downs than ups.  Maybe in reality it would be more like a sign wave, but let&#39;s just use this example.<br><br><br>So I split this stream apart and each value inside really is a superposition and I don&#39;t really know that the pattern<br>10001001 is in there until I put it through my polarizer/detector/whatever.  (I&#39;m trying to make this really simple and assume entanglement was happening.)<br>As the other receiver is spaced very precisely to be in phase(?) with the entangled photon is will produce a measurement also of the B stream.<br><br><br>So A receiver is getting  10001001  And it&#39;s fixed once received.  and the B pair then will be obviously get the reverse.<br>So B receiver is getting  01110110.  So the B pair of entangled particles will have the other 50% result, because they are entangled but have been fixed in their position and fell down from superposition since the A string was read by the A side.  In other words, when one beam is read I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s superposition before it&#39;s being read.  I can&#39;t tell I can merely verify if I know the data ahead of time.  Once I see the second stream the &quot;fate of quantum entrapment is read&quot;.  My free will reading imparted that pattern or fall from superposition, but didn&#39;t cause any part of it to happen.  It just happened as a result of fate from principle 1.  My free will reading fixed it, but I didn&#39;t set it.  Although B string has fallen out of superposition instantly the read will be the same as if it didn&#39;t it just appears to be opposite of A as it&#39;s fixed.<br><br><br>I KNOW THIS BECAUSE<br>I can read the B side and see the values but this is in a lab setting so I have access to both beams from the original.<br><br><br>CONCLUSION<br>I think what you are saying is when the B beam is read, I can tell the polarity and it&#39;s reverse of A, but I can&#39;t tell it was fixed to this value, because if I&#39;m on the other side of the universe I don&#39;t have access to the A beam nor knowledge that a read was done.<br><br><br>So this means The B beam is set by the A reading, but before it&#39;s read I have no way to know it was fixed to and a superposition particle.   Because I don&#39;t know it was altered and set out of superposition, I have no way to know it was read elsewhere.  I know it was read in my lab experiment by my other instrument, but I&#39;d never know if it was read on the other side of the universe if it came from some far away location.  Is this what you are saying when you say we can&#39;t alter the position of the particle.  We don&#39;t know if superposition exists, we just for any quantum particle, we just know the first read will set it.<br><br><br>I ask this because some sites state things like &quot;added spin&quot; can be added to the spin of a particle, probably an electron and when that happens the other quantum particle receives that same bump in it&#39;s spin anywhere else in the universe where ever it&#39;s at.  Which is saying something completely different.  Some other comments, perhaps by people who are just wrong, claim that we can change the quantum entangled particle and it will change the natural state of the particle.  I guess if we can&#39;t change it enough different from nature to see the change, we&#39;d never know if we changed it or some other observer.  If we could change the characteristic in some other way we might be able to send data instantly and that spooky induced action would break the laws of our bound universe in theory.  Be truly spooky.  But I think you are saying the former.  I&#39;m just trying to reconcile this with some other stuff I&#39;ve read or watched elsewhere.<br><br><br>Also the 10 percent experiment which shows that spooky action is happening is still somewhat difficult to see from your example.  So I don&#39;t know if this is really any better than some other ones I&#39;ve seen.

It doesn&#39;t make sense to measure its spin at a 45-degree angle.  So, don&#39;t scientists have to measure a particle&#39;s spin in the direction the particle is already spinning or 180 degrees opposite of that direction?  I looked up the Wikipedia definition of angular momentum, but because I suck at math, I couldn&#39;t understand the explanation.", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T01:14:46Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Eric Dary", "comment_text": "They use this in quantum cryptography, I wonder if they\u2019ll talk about that?", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T00:42:39Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Aruna", "comment_text": "dont really understand but still felt like I learnt something kinda", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T23:31:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zelks", "comment_text": "...What?", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T20:54:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "salvador vega", "comment_text": "you&#39;re lying if u think this makes sense to you.", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T18:47:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "absurd2k2", "comment_text": "Sup", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T17:30:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Shea", "comment_text": "What?", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T15:02:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Bencen", "comment_text": "How is it that opposite random results doesn&#39;t allow for communication from one particle to the other?

Under the concept of one-dimensional space, this point must go a corner anyway to get to another point. However, in a two-dimensional space, all points can be connected into a line, and are not subject to a checkerboard line defined by a one-dimensional space. So in a two-dimensional space you can go straight to a line without turning, and the creatures in a one-dimensional space seem incredible. Because super dimension can&#39;t be understood. Similarly, the closest two points in the two-dimensional space are the connections in the two-dimensional plane. However, in the three-dimensional space, the two points can be folded, so that the two points can be shortened in the three-dimensional space as the folding angle becomes smaller. This seems incredible in the biology of two-dimensional space. Similarly, some incredible phenomena of superluminal speed in three-dimensional space are actually because in the higher dimensional space, the connection between two points is actually synchronized based on some factors, but now many creatures in three-dimensional space must imagine This is a phenomenon of superluminal speed transfer and is not caused by some kind of connection, so it feels puzzling. I understand: Imagine you are folded in a piece of paper. Then write an E on the paper, the direction of the E is to the right. Spread the paper again. You will see the E along the crease mirror. No matter what angle you draw E, another E is mirrored when you open the paper. May be back to back or top to top, or bottom to bottom, or face to face. If you don&#39;t draw, you don&#39;t know the direction of E, similar to observation. Once you observe it, it is like you start painting on paper, and the place of the fold must be the opposite. This is the principle of quantum entanglement and may be related to some kind of connection in our space. It&#39;s like having a mirror-like delivery relationship in our space. This relationship does not require you to tell the other person after you have finished drawing, because when you draw, the particles opposite the crease begin to change synchronously. So this is not contrary to Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity. I don&#39;t need to draw an E and then draw a reverse E on the opposite side, but draw it at the same time.

Let&#39;s suppose this idea is correct. If the particles have hidden information, they assume a certain arrangement that we don&#39;t know of. According to this scenario, since Quantum Mechanics fails to explain what are the odds that the measured spin is up or down, we can suppose that each arrangement of different spins has the same probability to occur. There are 3 directions of measurement, so we need a 3 terms-string of Ups and Downs for the particles, and order counts. There are 8 of them: UUU (the other will be DDD), UUD (DDU), UDU (DUD), UDD (DUU), DUU (UDD), DUD (UDU), DDU (UUD), DDD (UUU). Each of these has 1/8 chance to be &quot;chosen&quot; by the particle. As you said, there are 2 cases: <br>1) All the terms of the string are the same spin. It happens twice. 100% chance that, if we randomly choose 1 term from the first string and 1 term from the other, we get opposite spin measurements.<br>2) One term of the string differs from the other two, and it occurs 6 times. 55,6% probability of obtaining different spins from the random choice of terms in the two strings. <br>Taking this into account, the exact probability of the two spins being opposite given any combination of spins measured in 3 directions should be 2/8*1 + 6/8*5/9, which is exactly 2/3 of the times (not 5/9).

Then, we open the first box and count the apples in it.  We know, simply by math, that if there are three apples in the first box, then there must be seven apples in the second box.

I would question one thing you said, that is, that measuring a particle can change its orientation.  Some physicists say that if you force the particle to change its state, you created decoherence and destroy the entanglement.  Also, in the Copenhagen interpretation, the particle does not have a definite angle of spin until measured.  One of your illustrations indicated that it did have a pre-existing angle of spin.  Here&#39;s my critique.<br><br>Bell\u2019s (or Bell\u2019s interpreter\u2019s) assumptions in his theorem are supposed to be EPR assumptions which can be reduced to absurdity, but they are not EPR assumptions.  They are quantum and random assumptions.<br><br>1&gt;EPR assumptions/predictions: When particles are created or entangled, they immediately have opposite spin 100% of the time which is necessary to preserve angular momentum.  The angle of spin (somewhere between 0 and 360) is set at the time of entanglement and embedded in the twin particles, so that even if they are separated, this information remains in the particles.  If one particle is spin up, the other will be spin down in the same line such as 0/180 \u2013 not in any combination of lines.  There is no half-down, \u00be down correlation - there is only fully down (180-degrees apart) correlation.  The whole point is to conserve angular momentum, and you can\u2019t conserve momentum half-way or \u00be of the way.  Given this interpretation, all particle pairs will have opposite and equal spin, that is, they will always be measured to have different states (A up/B down or A down/B up) and will never show the same states (A up/B up, or A down/B down).  If particles show the same states, then they were not entangled to begin with. <br>2&gt;Quantum (Copenhagen) assumptions/predictions:  When particles are entangled, they acquire some basic  information, that is, to always have opposite spin when measured, but the direction or angle of spin is undetermined until measured.  The superposition interpretation is that the particles have all possible angles of spin until measured \u2013 the other interpretation is that they have no definite direction of spin before measured.  So, in Q-M, half the information (particles will have opposite spin) is embedded locally, but the other half (angle of spin) is not.  Since the constraint to be measured with opposite spin, even in the quantum interpretation, is built into the entanglement process to conserve angular momentum, then the prediction should be the same as EPR\u2019s prediction \u2013 that 100% of the time the entangled particles will show opposite spin to conserve angular momentum when measured.  If the pair shows the same angle of spin, then they were not entangled.  However, the interpreters of Bell tell us that the odds are 50% for same spin and 50% for opposite spin.  Of course, entanglement means particles will have opposite spin or different spin when measured at a distance.  Is there any other meaning to the word \u201centanglement?\u201d If spin is not entangled, then what is?  Entanglement means that particles have mirror-correlated DNA.<br>3&gt;Random pairing of particles without entanglement:  The real assumption of the interpreters of Bell are that the particles are independent of each other so that sometimes particle A can be spin up and particle B can be spin up also and vice versa.  If this same behavior occurs, then there is no entanglement and the odds would be 50/50 of getting a same response or getting a different response.  After all, the experiment boils down to the fact that either the pair is opposite in spin or the same in spin.  There are two ways of getting same spin (particle A up and particle B up or, vice versa, particle A is down and particle B is down).  And, there are two ways of getting a different measurement (particle A up, particle B down or particle A down, particle B up).  So, regardless of the number of detectors, it boils down to a 50/50 chance of getting the same or different response.  As can be seen, the Random pairing of particles gives the same prediction as the quantum (Copenhagen) prediction \u2013 50/50 either way.  Since the quantum interpretation does not differentiate itself from the random interpretation, it is not a scientific theory because one could attribute a 50/50 result to either interpretation.  There is an equality here - not an inequality.  The inequality exists between the EPR interpretation and the random/quantum interpretations.<br><br>The fact that EPR, even in the flawed experiment, gives a 55+% result in particle-pairs showing opposite spin says that EPR is in the direction of its 100% prediction.  At least it beats the odds.  The fact that quantum theory does not beat the chance expectation of 50/50 shows that it does not really predict anything that a flip of a coin would predict.  Most theories predict that the results will be a deviation from chance.

Being 0 degrees, the second being 60). So how can scientists think that there is some sort of \u201cfaster than light communication\u201d when one is measured (determined what spin) that it then transfers its information to the other particle how ever far apart when through the physics we know now (if there is no other physics unknown used) it would gain a certain percentage of the spin originally as soon as the photons are entangled and due to unknown information we have until we depict it through measurement is when we know its spin. That doesn\u2019t mean that from the time we initially measure it is when the spin occurs? So if once measured on a say vertical axes of a photons wave and one particle measures out an \u201cup\u201d spin and the other then measured a \u201cdown\u201d spin due to the percentage of 50%. If measured once again (using same photon previously measured) would it still have the same \u201cspin\u201d? But when measured the first time the \u2018vertical wave length\u2019 of that photon will need to \u2018hit\u2019 a detector stopping that vertical wave length, if we could measure it with a continuous flow we could measure multiple times throughout multiple time periods between each measurement and depict a further percentage that may be more accurate? And may solve the answer to wether or not information is transferred from one particle to the other in the percentage it does so (as explained in the video). So that would depict the truth of which theory is maybe correct? Or even a different way no one has thought if as it is unknown and out of our reach due to its 4th dimensional physics that we can explain it happens but not how... please correct me if I am wrong and please answer as these questions and theory of mine is either correct or even somewhat possible (if there was a machine that could depict its measurement with its continuous flow)?", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T07:43:04Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Pavel Kadera", "comment_text": "how does the change of a direction of a measurement change \u200bthe outcome of the spin?", "comment_date": "2017-12-11T18:24:30Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "theuknownawesomeness", "comment_text": "If they always measure in opposite directions wouldn&#39;t you still be able to communicate even if it was random?

For instance, a spaceship is 5 light years away from earth, and earth is trying to send messages to the ship via quantum entanglement (QE) communicator.  If that ship run into some trouble, such as dodging an asteroid field, and the ship start rotating randomly, the communication receiver will spin in random direction.

In my opinion stating &quot;&gt;5/9&quot; and showing a running counter stopping at 55.5% (this was actually worse, since it implies a test or simulation that had been running) is somewhat misleading - although not incorrect of course.<br><br>My reasoning is the following:<br><br>You talked about having only two &quot;base&quot; states that matter (uuu or uud in which u=up and d=down) due to the fact that all other states were &quot;mathematically equivalent&quot;, which of course is true. However, the number of equivalent states for each base state  are not! Hence the misunderstanding of my simulation results on my part. The full set of 3-bit states is the following:<br>1 - uuu (base state 1)<br>2 - ddd (equivalent to base state 1)<br>3 - uud (base state 2)<br>4 - udu (equivalent to base state 2)<br>5 - udd (equivalent to base state 2)<br>6 -  duu (equivalent to base state 2)<br>7 - dud (equivalent to base state 2)<br>8 - ddu (equivalent to base state 2)<br><br>This means base state 1 (the all aligned state) has a probability of occuring 2/8 times, while the base state 2 states with one misaligned spin occur 6/8 of the time. This leads to a probability of detecting opposites spin of:<br><br>(2/8 x 1) + (6/8 x 5/9) = 48/72 =2/3 thus approximately 66.7%<br><br>It might be helpful for other lost souls like me who would like to simulate the Bell experiment. It would&#39;ve helped me, since somehow I was too hung up on the 55.5% running counter.

In other words as the QEP travel forward through time, they need to keep the Universe totally balanced so that the last causal event results in a balanced endpoint.  If the QEP were unconnected, then eventually as the universe collapses to a single endpoint in time and space (from either direction), we would end up with unbalanced spin vectors. From a multiple universe perspective, the appearance of QEP behavior is to prevent illegal (illegal = mathematically impossible) universes at some point in time.", "comment_date": "2017-07-14T06:01:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rumman Muhammad", "comment_text": "cool show buddy..", "comment_date": "2017-07-14T01:52:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chicawhappa", "comment_text": "I am just wondering, what is the origin of the 2 particles.

The results that are certain is that detectors at 0\u00ba are 100% correlated and at a 90\u00ba degree angle they are 50%. At angles in between you are not quite sure how this progresses, you used the the cosine equation to express that relation, but that is not a given from the previous 2 statements that this has to be the case, however this is something you might be able to confirm experimentally. Imagine just the cases where particles always goes trough the same detector every time, this is essentially is a subset of the results of the experiment, but what you also have is a lab setup that tells you what is the correlation between the results at different angles.

Entangled &#39;particles&#39;&#39; and &#39;superposition&#39;. <br>(This text is by no means to be taken more seriously than you should, but it still an idea worth thinking...)<br><br>So! How do we start?<br>We start with a point! <br>(lol no! Sorry that&#39;s from somewhere else). <br><br>~ ~ We start by imagining a 2 dimensional world called Flatland ~ ~<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Now let&#39;s imagine that me and you and everyone lives inside this Flatland world and everything lacks height! Actually there is no height at all. Not even a tiny bit of it. Nothing, zero, nil, nada. No height allowed. That means that if I fold that 2d world, one could say that the one side is going to be &#39;touching&#39; the other that is folded but that&#39;s actually very wrong! (btw let&#39;s just think this flatland as a piece of paper) <br><br>Even if we fold the paper in two and press it with our hands (even if we cannot do that with a 2d paper but let&#39;s move on...) the people living on the one side and the people living at the other, won&#39;t touch - see - hear or feel in any way the other people from the other side!!!! Of Course to us that can see the &#39;whole picture&#39; it will look like they do, but remember! We have 3 dimensions. They have only 2! That means that they are unaware that their world had just been folded together in a higher dimension than theirs.<br><br>But where does all a that helps?<br><br>Now imagine that we have 2 particles. Particle number A and particle number B. Let&#39;s say that these particles spin and they are entangled (when one is observed the other also reacts like it has been observed as well). And let&#39;s say that we place the 1st particle at the one side of the paper and the other at the same side but far away from the particle A. Then we fold the paper so that particle A and particle B actually &quot;touch&quot; each other! (they land on-top of each other).<br><br>From our perspective that&#39;s what they do! They &#39;touch&#39; each other, or in other words, it seems as there is hardly and space between them. But from the flatlanders perspective, these 2 particles are very, very, very far away from each other and by no means connected. Now we run the experiment, we observe the particle A, it snaps in UP spin and then we observe the particle B that has already snapped in DOWN spin. From our 3 dimensional perspective that&#39;s not weird at all! These 2 particles they don&#39;t seem to be far apart not even the slightest, actually they appear so close as if they are actually connected with each other. No wonder that when you measure the 1st the second is also going to be observed... Something that ofcourse the Flatlanders have no way to ever know or feel or observe in any possible way. They are completely trapped within their 2 dimensions, unable to even imagine the world as it really is. Imperfect as they are, they keep seeing a world that is flat and more importantly, they keep seeing 2 particles, behaving in a &#39;spooky&#39; way while being far apart from each other.<br><br>So now, we can do the same to our world and our perspective about it. We only have 3 dimensions, but, be ready, because we are going to depart for the 4 dimension! What if our world is folded just like Flatland (which is actually far from flat) and we can&#39;t even start to imagine how our world really is like. In that framework, entangled particles and spooky action at a distance are completely wrong ideas about the real world!<br><br>And here is why...<br><br>1st of all, (if all the above are correct) there would be no &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; because 1st) there is no distance 2nd) there is nothing spookiness <b>because these 2 entangled particles, can be thought to be so close together that could easily interact with each other while one of which is being observed, the other is also changing.</b><br><br>BUT furthermore! Something even cooler arises from that thought!<br>And that&#39;s that these 2 particles are not even 2 particles! They could very well be just one! A single particle! A particle that exist at the point where these 2 folded sides of Flatland (or our 3d world) are touching each other and simply this one particle exists in the 3rd dimension (of the 4th depending to which experiment we are talking about). That particle will look like 2, but it is actually just one and only! But it&#39;s a different particle than the ones we have been observing so far. It is a particle that exceeds our 2 dimensional world, or 3 dimensional world that has been folded tricking us to believe that there is spooky action at a distance between 2 particles...<br><br>Where in reality:<br><br><b>1) There is nothing spooky going on</b><br><br><b>2) There is no distance</b><br><br><b>3) There is no second particle</b><br><br><b>4) There are no particles in superposition</b><br><br><b>5) There is no information traveling faster than light</b><br><br>It is just one particle, with the only exception that it seems to extend to plus one dimension more than we do.<br><br>And finally we arrive at the solution of the second problem of, Superposition.<br><br>&quot;How can something be at 2 states at the same time?&quot; <b>Well it might not! It might very well be spinning UP in the one &quot;side of the paper&quot; and DOWN &quot;at the other&quot;, and when it is observed, the one snaps UP and the other DOWN. There is no big deal! Only everything takes place in a plus higher dimension where a single point can become a huge line and a single particle can be thought as 2 individual ones.</b><br><br>Lastly I wanna say, that we use to think as information is traveling &quot;faster than light&quot; when we talk about superposition. By that example that I just gave, information is not traveling faster than the speed of light, because <b>information is not traveling at all</b> ! There are no individual &quot;entangled&quot; particles! There is just one single particle! But because it exists in more than 3 dimensions, a lot of weird things can happen to trick us to believe that it has an enabled twin, that it is somehow connected and that somehow information is traveling faster than the speed of light... Just as string theory is suggesting, there might infact be extra dimensions crawled up in the planck length. <br><br>If so, then the weirdness of Quantum Mechanics, just... evaporates!<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>(I also posted this at Reddit)", "comment_date": "2016-05-21T01:36:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laila Msouhli", "comment_text": "The DC hero called Firestorm is a simpler way of explaining quatum entanglement.", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T23:01:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FantastyckplastycK", "comment_text": "likes of you are the hope for mankind&#39;s future, great job", "comment_date": "2016-05-19T18:56:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dav3", "comment_text": "Your moms a spinner", "comment_date": "2016-05-18T14:42:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bandaru ravindra", "comment_text": "This is absolutely the best video demonstrating concepts of entanglement and Bell&#39;s inequality.

In this case, the probability of the particle spinning up is the sum of the probability of all \u0398s (from 0 to 2 pi) {Sum&lt;0--2pi&gt;(cos^2(\u0398/2))/N}. if the steps of this sum get too small close to \u0398 the sum will be integral and N becomes 2pi, thus P(^)=Integral&lt;0-2pi&gt;(cos^2(\u0398/2)) /2pi = [sin(\u0398)/2+ \u0398/2]&lt;0-2pi&gt;/2pi = \u00bd.

Firstly, this video does not include a mention to or explanation of (collapsing) wave functions but what it did mention is that these &quot;entangled&quot; particles do not have any hidden information within them which would therefore mean that examining the spin of 1 particle in a pair would directly influence the outcome of the results found in observing the other particle instead of just revealing hidden information in the particle as previously thought. Now let&#39;s incorporate the concept of collapsing wave functions.So the examination of a particle or said particle&#39;s spin collapses the probability of it&#39;s position into one state, now if knowing the state of one of these entangled particles doesn&#39;t just tell you the state of the other but has a direct influence on it therefore collapsing the wave function of one particle also collapses the other particle&#39;s two possible states (spin up or down). Now when one examines a particle such as one in the double slit experiment it INSTANTANEOUSLY collapses to one state(passing through only one slit) So therefore these entangled particles do carry &quot;information&quot; over an arbitrary distance faster than light if not instantly. Interested to hear what people think :) P.S it helps to not think of spin as the traditional sense of the word but rather as a way of saying different states a particle can be in (for explanation&#39;s sake)", "comment_date": "2015-12-31T21:41:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Relaxation Eddie", "comment_text": "So our knowledge(observation) is not faster then the speed of light.\u00a0 But the actual process is.\u00a0 I think this in my picture still boisters the idea that the quantum world is void of time.\u00a0\u00a0 Would you agree?\u00a0 Similar to the detection device in different locations in the double split experiments.", "comment_date": "2015-12-30T20:16:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KennyT", "comment_text": "Quantum entanglement doesn&#39;t transfer any physical information between the particle - and that is not up to interpretation.

The video&#39;s spin measurement arrow @<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&amp;t=1m00s\">1:00</a> actually provides a good way to intuitively visualize how quantum spin mathematics works.<br><br>Imagine a Z-axis perpendicular to the vertical Y-axis and horizontal X-axis of the arrow. The spin of the electron along the vertical Y-axis is then represented (as shown in the video) as a constant circular rotation of the particle in the XZ plane. The up-down polarity of the spin indicates whether the spin rotation is clockwise or counter-clockwise. The Z-axis is not a real-value coordinate in physical space, it is the imaginary axis of the electron&#39;s complex-valued Bohmian pilot wave along the X-axis.<br><br>When you next attempt to measure the particle&#39;s spin along the X-axis, you get a sequence of up-down spin polarity readings that average over time to zero. You can visualize these readings as binary projections of the phase angle of the particle&#39;s circular spin in the XZ plane, sampled at random intervals. I.E. when the phase of the XZ spin is positive, the spin along the Y-axis is CW, and when it&#39;s negative the spin is CCW. As the video goes on to show, spin measurements along non-perpendicular axes will produce averages corresponding to the inclination angle of the non-perpendicular axis.\ufeff<br><br>In Bohmian Mechanics, all measured quantities other than the position of the particle are produced by entanglement of the measuring device with the particle&#39;s pilot wave. Since spin is not actually a property of the particle itself, it is meaningless to imagine that a measured particle might somehow transmit information to its entangled partner particle instantaneously at a speed faster than light.<br><br>What happens instead is that the evolution of the pilot wave of the entangled pair of particles is altered by interaction with the measuring device. A pilot wave is not akin to an electromagnetic wave that propagates through 4D spacetime; it is a non-local modulation of spacetime itself that evolves in complex-dimensioned quantum configuration space. The dynamic geometry of spacetime is not limited by the speed of light; it modulates and expands instantaneously and non-locally as the wavefunction of the entire universe evolves over time. It is only the motions of particles and fields contained within 4D spacetime that are limited by the speed of light, not the quantum fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime itself.", "comment_date": "2015-03-05T05:57:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Chau", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t get it... there are infinite amount of particules, how do we know which two are oppositely related?", "comment_date": "2015-03-05T05:19:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siobhan O'Toole", "comment_text": "Always awesome!!", "comment_date": "2015-03-04T19:15:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HappyTimes", "comment_text": "How incredibly and doubletalk. 45 seconds in you already begin the double talk.

My understanding of entanglement is that the two particles inhabit a quantum state in which they cannot be considered independent (cannot be factored into single particle superpositions). So when you measure the particle, you&#39;re not measuring just one independent particle, you&#39;re measuring one part of an entangled system whose state is well defined and existed prior to measurement. In this view, the other particle that you didn&#39;t measure doesn&#39;t change it&#39;s state because you measured the other, instead your measurement has found that the system is in the state where your particle is spin up and the other down or vice versa. This information is present well before measurement since, usually, the entangled state has to be prepared and in this spin case will look something like updown+downup.

For example, lets say that the first spin is measured a spin up and the second spin is measured a spin up. I think what happened was that the first spin was unknown then it was a spin up after being measured. Then the second spin was a spin down because of the first spin, but then it was a spin up because it was measured. The first spin would then be a spin down; however, we would not see the result because it happened after the second spin was measured.

For example: forget two particles. A single photon is created at a point in space and expands outward in all directions according to Schrodinger&#39;s wave equation in a spherical wave-front. One light-year away to the left, we have a photodetector; and one light-year away on the right, we have another photodetector. Viewed in the quantum language of wave-particle duality, we say just before it gets detected either on the left or right the photon is in a superposition of states of existing/not-existing on the right and of existing/not-existing on the left. When detected, the wave equation supposedly &quot;collapses&quot; and there is a 50% chance that it will be found on, say, the left, and then instantaneously - and &quot;spookily&quot; (?) - it will not be found on the right, in accordance with conservation of energy. Couldn&#39;t this case be viewed just like the two entangled particle case you describe? Except that instead of conservation of angular momentum being conserved between two entangled particles, we have conservation of energy; and instead of spin-up or spin-down, we have existing or not-existing. It&#39;s odd that in the two particle case, we get amazed and start calling it &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;, but in the single particle case, we have no problem with the seemingly faster-than-light message that the found-to-exist virtual particle at the left detector &quot;sends&quot; to the not-found-to-exist virtual particle at the right detector!<br><br>Further, I really get the feeling that the fundamental &quot;spookiness&quot; of this whole thing is only due to the false premise that the wave equation collapses at all, a fabrication of our viewpoint that leaves the observer (and the rest of the universe) out of the calculation. If you let the entire universe be a vastly complex, interacting wave equation that never collapses, I assume that the spookiness will evaporate. (And be replaced by a new spookiness: the multiverse.

Since the idea of these &quot;plans&quot; is a mathematical simplification of what would actually be going on in the particles (which don&#39;t care about our humanly invented 3-direction 60 degree measuring system), to assume a linear PDF for the plans is absurd anyway.<br><br>So, I still suggest that all the information could be contained in the particles after their creation, and that they are not signaling each other faster than light.

You can&#39;t just arbitrarily assign numbers that feel natural to you when you don&#39;t understand what is the correlation between the directions. It&#39;s just wrong.<br>It is obvious that the description of spin is wrong. It is described as having 1 preferential directions above all others, but the experiment itself shows that it isn&#39;t so because you can almost always measure the spin no matter what angle 1 measurement is made relative to the other while what you would expect is that measurements at 90 from each other should have a bigger number of instances where the spin was measured in one detector but completely unmeasured on the other.<br>The fact that the events occurred at an instance and location in which information would need to travel faster than light shouldn&#39;t lead to the conclusion that information traveled faster than light but rather that no information hasn&#39;t been exchanged. i.e. the measurement of one particle did not affect the measurement of the other. You could never use it to transmit information because no information has been exchanged. The problem is the way in which the probabilities are assigned are wrong.<br>The reason why this seams confusing is partly due to the fact that entanglement comes in pairs. In the hypothetical scenario in which you could entangle 3 particles, a trion, let&#39;s say that 2 add to be up and 1 down if measured in the same direction (or whatever other equivalent configuration), you could transmit information just by measuring 2 of them perpendicularly. Because if that interpretation were to be correct the correlation would have to as such that you would know with more than 50% probability on what quadrant was the 3rd particle measured. But here is my prediction, if such a trion were to exist, the correlation between the measurement of the 3rd particle with the first 1 would be the same as the correlation between the 3rd and the 2nd and they in turn would be the same as if you had measured only 2 of them.
