We exist, and there&#39;s billions of other stars and planets out there. And there&#39;s even life on Earth that could potentially survive on other moons and maybe a planet or two in our own solar system.<br><br>Whether or not they&#39;ve visited Earth is a different story. I am very open to say both they have or they haven&#39;t. Just show me the definitive evidence. The scale of the universe and the distances to travel are indeed extremely vast. But Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, which is much later than the first planets which got started about 11 billion years ago. Life appeared on Earth 3.5 billion years ago and land life appeared ~500 million years ago. It took less than a million years for complex animals much like the ones we see today to begin roaming the Earth, and the dinosaurs first roamed the Earth less than 250 million years ago.<br><br>This means that it&#39;s not unlikely that somewhere is a species that lives on an 8 billion year old rock where life appeared in the same stages and took the same amount of time. And a sentient species on that planet may have avoided any dark ages or technological stints and gained literally billions of years of technological advancement before humans even existed. And those same beings may have very well figured out how to build a warp drive to travel around the cosmos potentially infinitely fast. And for all we know we may crack this technology tomorrow.<br><br>With this reasoning and understanding, the biggest reason aliens would not have visited us on Earth is simply that the universe is so freaking big that we may just get missed, stepped over, or just not be anywhere near any of these kinds of civilizations. Finding our particular world may be like trying to find an individual blade of grass on Earth. We&#39;ve mapped all of Earth, but individual blades of grass are so common we just can&#39;t even care about where they are or whether or not we&#39;ve found any fraction of them all.<br><br>I think if there were a hyper advanced civilization billions of years ahead of us, we would be like a blade of grass under them, super easy to step over and miss.

There is just as much possibility them not existing as existing.. the size of the universe doesn&#39;t add probability, nor does it deflate probability..so there is a strong possibility they don&#39;t exist hence given the size. Just a thought but if the universe really is infinite in its size because of expansion, then couldn&#39;t be possibly something that has quickly replicated itself like a Hologram or you sitting doing the Copy and Paste X amount of times. Excuse my semantics but you don&#39;t need to buy into the holographic principle. Some people might argue given its infinity, it hints more of a wasteland with nothing in than something ordered and compact. (Not entropy) while I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to agree with them, it&#39;s worth noting that we have whole solar systems, millions of them detected with no life on, which is so hard to contemplate the size.. 100 earth&#39;s can fit inside Jupiter. Jupiter can&#39;t even be landed on. So the odds are slim.. despite given the infinite chances. Paradoxically, if the universe is infinite, we might just have to wait for a loonggg time for conditions to be right, maybe even we don&#39;t need to count expansion, we just need conditions to be right in our own sol system. Unfortunately, we probably won&#39;t exist then. The size of the universe doesn&#39;t imply E.T size doesn&#39;t matter.

They must also be carbon based, other systems have been modeled, they all crash. Natural random events will never ever generate complex carbon based molecules.

Why would any member of an advanced intraterrestrial or extraterrestrial civilization want to communicate with someone of your limited intellectual capabilities?  I am not trying to insult you.  I&#39;m just stating a fact.  You don&#39;t even know the true history of your planet, let alone how it is managed.  Furthermore, your knowledge of astronomy is based on primitive concepts which, in a few centuries, will be regarded with the same disdain as that of modern physicists who laugh at the notion that the Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe by medieval astronomers.<br><br>THE EMERGENCE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE WAS INEVITABLE<br><br>If a universal God exists and it created ideal conditions for life to evolve only on Earth then this God would not be very intelligent.  What intelligent God would create a fertile planet surrounded by a vast and sterile universe?  The reality of the situation is that the four known forces which govern the behaviour of matter and energy are calibrated to such a degree of perfection that it is inconceivable that they were not predetermined to create the conditions for life to appear in all its various forms throughout the universe.  Intellectually and mathematically, the postulate that life exists only on Earth is both naive and absurd.  But if intelligent extraterrestrial life exists in the Galaxy, why have they not contacted us?  Where are they located and what would they look like?  These are the questions that have always been asked by an uninformed public.  Unfortunately the people most qualified to answer these questions such as biologists, physicists, philosophers, chemists, astronomers and religious intellectuals have, for the most part, always claimed that we are alone in the Universe.  Historically they have always been wrong because they have not had access to all the information that exists on the subject which is reserved only for a minority of privileged and very powerful people in the world and unfortunately that does not include you. <br> <br>I find it amusing that people like you don&#39;t even realize that Earth was conquered long ago and is in a region of the galaxy dominated by a species called the Alpha Draconians.  Impossible you say?  Not necessarily!  So how would a hostile species tackle the problem of dominating another species?  It is probable that the preferred method of controlling a planet for a highly intelligent and technologically advanced malevolent race of extraterrestrials would be covert infiltration rather than by obvious and violent force.  Moreover, as a general rule, one does not destroy what one can control so the most logical strategy would be to control the leadership of the planet, its political, military and economic establishments but more importantly, the secret societies, affiliations and clubs which control these establishments.  Conquering a species that doesn&#39;t know it has been conquered  is the mark of superior intelligence.  Obviously some people may doubt the existence of malevolent extraterrestrials in the first place.  Why would they exist at all?  The answer is that the universe would be a much less interesting and dynamic place if various species were not pushed to their limits in order to survive and evolve.  Without conflict and struggle to survive in highly competitive environments, there would be no incentive to adapt and change.  As a consequence, the process of evolution would slow down dramatically and the plethora of unique species that exist today would also decrease significantly.  For intelligent and technological species, this eternal struggle is a philosophical one between the precepts of malevolence and benevolence.  In other words between the desire to dominate other species or being subjugated oneself.  It would also be the contrast between autocratic self-serving behaviour or believing in freedom, equality and democracy.  Ironically without the existence of emotions in many extraterrestrial species in the universe, it is doubtful that benevolent species would exist at all because if all actions and behaviour are deemed to be acceptable without limits, then the emergence of a code of ethics cannot occur.  In a certain sense, this philosophical struggle corresponds to the yin and yang in Chinese philosophy which describes how apparently opposite and contrary forces are actually complementary.  More precisely, each serves as a reference point for the other.  Fortunately the capacity for emotions such as pleasure and pain serve as a strong foundation for the emergence of a code of ethics among most intelligent species in the universe.    <br><br>Hopefully you will now understand that the universe is teeming with life.  It has always been this way and will always be this way.  I cannot expect you to understand why these cycles are eternal because your brain is psychologically programmed to understand absolutes and quantifiable events in finite terms.  In this context the belief that the universe is approximately 13 billion years old and has boundaries is as quaint as it is inaccurate.", "comment_date": "2019-06-08T23:56:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pelican74", "comment_text": "Are you asking bums on the street lol?

I suppose alien visitation becomes more likely if the aliens have already colonised numerous planets and then branch out exponentially; making it only a matter of time before every habitable planet is colonised.

Even before scrolling down to the comments I knew the most prevalent ones would be &quot;Wow, look at all these stupid people&quot;. What, personally, gives me <b>far</b> less hope for humanity is not the people depicted in the video, not knowing what a light year or a galaxy is, but these comments and people who make them. <br><br>When you belittle people for not knowing certain things you are not encouraging them to pursue that knowledge you are actively embarrassing them and putting them below the average person; and you are making society worse. I am more than certain that all of you out there are been discouraged, by another person, from doing something because you &quot;sucked at it&quot;. It&#39;s not a nice feeling, and you&#39;ve missed out on doing some incredible things because of it.<br><br>If a child says something like &quot;A light year is probably 150 human years&quot; not many people would bat an eye, they would just think it&#39;s cute and tussle the child&#39;s hair. ^God forbid^ an adult not know something that has nothing to do with their work or lifestyle. ^Because as we all know^,  when we age all facets of our knowledge increase at the same rate. So, at the age of 21, ^we all know^ galaxies contain billions of stars and how to properly change a tyre and on what day of the week D-day happened on. If you don&#39;t know just one of those things then &quot;you&#39;re stupid&quot; and are essentially being an oxygen thief to the rest of us ^highly intelligent beings^.<br><br>Understand that all knowledge and all skill has to be accumulated at some point, some people start later than others. A massive outlet for human misery at the moment is someone starts something and because of their age or background they are expected to know better. People do <b>not</b> start amazing at anything. If they do there is probably something similar they&#39;ve done in the past to help them, and even then they could still be bad at it. Be nice to those at the bottom of the ladder, it&#39;ll be a huge drive to climb it.<br><br>I&#39;m sure a fair few of you would argue &quot;this is common knowledge&quot; or &quot;this was taught in school, there&#39;s no excuse to not know this&quot;. Who gets to define &quot;common knowledge&quot;? I&#39;m sure something as mundane as changing a tyre is common knowledge but a fair majority of people reading this don&#39;t know how to do it. Also, plenty of things are taught in school that people forget because they don&#39;t *use it*. I remember there being wood work classes but I have completely forgotten all facets of it because I have not wood-worked since. Do I not like wood-work? No, I like it but my home didn&#39;t have the facilities for me to pursue that hobby.<br><br>Veritasium is probably showing these interviews because during the talks with these people he didn&#39;t laugh at them. He didn&#39;t insult them. He told them the answers without talking down to them. He opened a door for them and showed them an amazing word. If they were not that interested to learn further than fair enough.<br><br>Veritasium makes these videos to educate all kinds of people.

Let me explain. <br><br>We earthlings lack the motivation to answer the question definitively. Is that wrong? No. Why? Because we have more pressing matters to solve on this planet itself. Finding another planet with life is not a unified cause for all the people on earth (governments, when I mean people). We do have some organizations who keep researching on it, but it&#39;s just not enough. At the current rate of R&amp;D into the field, the possibility of finding a planet with life doesn&#39;t exist. Unless all of the governments (most powerful ones at least) in our world take this question as a priority, pool their resources and talent, and really focus on it for a substantial time, we won&#39;t have an answer for sure. <br><br>Having said that, there is another issue. Lets consider that there is actually a planet outside our solar system which very much resembles earth and can sustain life. If we manage to locate that planet, the first course of action will be to try and send communication signals. By doing so, we&#39;re assuming (or hoping) that there is an intelligent life on the planet which can receive our radio signals and possibly reply. <br><br>The motivation will take a beating if we do not receive a reply. Even if there is an intelligent life form on the planet, we&#39;d be assuming that they use radio or even understand the concept of it. <br><br>My question lies here.. Will there be enough motivation left for us to globally fund and organize a space programme to send an orbiter or satellite close enough to the planet to try and get answers. <br><br>Even if we decide on doing that, we currently do not have the technology to reach there fast enough. These planets are light years away from us, mind you. Nobody living on earth today is going to live long enough to receive answers. We&#39;ll be hoping that tens of forthcoming generations will continue the programme. That&#39;s a big assumption. Also, we&#39;re ruling out the fact that the equipment that we send out today, will become technologically obsolete before it even reaches half way to the planet. <br><br>So unless we invent warp drive, the feasibility of the whole &#39;search for definitive answers&#39; is negligible. <br><br>Knowing all these aspects, it&#39;s highly unlikely that we would have enough motivation to carry out such a massive mission, investing a hell lot of money, talent and resources, where the same can be used here, on earth, to solve more important issues we&#39;re dealing with everyday. <br><br>So we just sit back on earth, shooting radio signals at planets we think might have intelligent life, in a hope that somebody might listen, decode and reply back. <br><br>There is a very high probability of existence of aliens, but there also a high probability of not finding it anytime soon.", "comment_date": "2016-07-05T08:35:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jenson Hall", "comment_text": "Statistically speaking there is almost no chance that we&#39;re alone.

If you deny that aliens exist, you deny your own existence. Aliens... Our fantasies demand to see aliens as intelligent as us or even further developed, especially if they could visit us because our technology is still too primitive to travel through space and explore other galaxies. <br><br>The planet earth was born 4.6 billions of years ago, 4.5 billions of years ago the moon was born by a collision with the earth with another planet from space and pieces of that planet and earth propelled back into space and those formed the moon (earth wasn&#39;t round in the beginning, due of the spinning it formed into a sphere and the moon in orbit around the earth, having this torque, this pulling effect which affects all life on earth including the earth&#39;s behavior - so basically earth and the other planet made a baby: the moon), 3.8 billions of years ago the first bacteria was formed (thus life), 2.0 billions of years ago single cell organism was formed, 0.5 billions of years ago oxygen was formed in the air, 2 millions of years ago human species was born from which 200,000 years ago homo sapiens and 50,000 years ago homo erectus. 230 millions of years ago dinosaurs walked the earth and existed for 165 millions of years. The human race is still young compared to all these figures in similar differentiation. There are planets in the universe that are way older and younger and some dies or get born or destroyed by a black hole. There might even have been alien civilizations but got annihilated by a sun that became nova or got swallowed by a black hole. All we can do is merely speculate but never assume that aliens do not exist.<br><br>Humans tend to think earth ways and with the knowledge about physics of today&#39;s standard. Alien life can be totally the opposite as we think how life exist and evolves. It could be a combination of carbon life and another matter which is unknown to us. The question is however, can humans accept this possibility? Or is humanity still too narrow minded, too young to mentally grasp that knowledge?

There are billions of stars, an estimated 10 billion.  billions and billions of suns, with those numbers it would be fair to say that we are probably not the only star that supports a solar system. Each sun has the potential to have its own solar system of planets.  Now with the potential of billions of solar systems there is the potential for there to be millions and millions of earth like planets. With the potential of millions and millions of earths to think we are the only earth that has the atmosphere and conditions to support life when we can&#39;t even see these planets let alone get to theme is extremely naive.  SO with the potential of life on potentially millions , ( possibly billions) of earths, there is no reason why intelligent life wouldn&#39;t exist there also. They could be human, they could be humanoid and appear a little different much like people do in different geographical locations of the world. Now,  with the  astronomical potential of other earths and other humanoids existing it would be fair to assume some of the intelligent life has made more progress than others. Its fair to say some may be behind us in evolution and some may be ahead. Some may think they are the most intelligent evolved species out there or some may be speculating the way we do here. Some may have the technology to explore other galaxies or solar systems by being able to build crafts that obviously dont run on gasoline and can maneuver at light speed.  Millions of people report seeing flying objects they say they disappear in a snap which is what it would have to take to travel such distances.  I know people are going to say even  the speed of light isn&#39;t fast enough but how in the hell are humans able to estimate a distance of something you can&#39;t see or get to. They could be off by millions of miles.  Infact every theory or guesstimate is just the best answer (for now) and by no means factual because we simply dont have technology to prove how far away these other solar systems are and which ones support life.

So even if there&#39;s tons of planets with life on them, most will probably be micro-organisms, and most of the rest would have some variation of un-intelligent organisms. Probably. Judging by just 1 planet, our own, it&#39;s hardly easy to predict if intelligence or society-building are things that would occur on most planets with multi-cellular lifeforms... I mean, we only know of 1 occurence on earth itself, primates... many other intelligent animals exist, but the conditions for them to ever build a civilisation in the absence of humans seem to be difficult if not impossible to meet (i.e why would a dolphin evolve arm-like appendages and start building tools). <br>So while the huge number of planets makes it plausible for life to exist, and while I personally believe intelligent life would probably also exist there, the incredible distances that separate us from them are depressing... not only in space, but also in time.

Aliens exist. I know, because I saw a UFO once. <br><br>Actually, what I saw, were two lights hovering at the end of my street. After my attention was drawn to them, by this white spotlight, shining through my apartment kitchen window. At first, I thought the spotlight must be workmen up the pole at the end of the street. Even though that had never happened before. Walking into the kitchen as it skittered across the floor, I noticed the spotlight was asymmetrical, and more penetrating than a normal light. It had shafts within shafts in it. Just like the spotlights depicted in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Just.plain.weird.     <br><br>Reaching the window, I peered into the darkness. What I saw, were two lights hovering, seemingly at the end of the street. One was red, the other was blue, or green. Can&#39;t remember which anymore. The white spotlight was gone. The two colored lights, were about the size of a car tire. Though I can not attest to my scaling abilities. And seemed to be attached to a craft of some kind. Because the lights remained a fixed distance apart. They did not flicker or flit about independently. And when the lights moved, they still remained fixed. <br><br>I strained and strained to see better, to see more. To see if I could make out an outline. But could not; it was just too dark. As my mind reeled at the thought, I just might be looking at an alien craft, the lights hovered down the street perpendicular to mine. With trees, and houses behind it, along with wires in front and back. A very tight spot for a flying saucer. With the lights still visible to me, it then slowly moved down a parallel street. At first, I hoped this would offer a chance to see more of whatever it was, as it would be hovering past a street light. But with the colored lights now angling away from me, and buildings now getting in the way, that did not happen. <br><br>I thought about clambering down the apartment stairs, to get a better look. But it was 2 or 3 in the morning, was winter, and I was barefoot in a robe, and nearly 300 pounds. Just was not going to happen. So I walked across my apartment, to the living room window, and waited for the lights to reappear, at the other end of the parallel street. That would put them a lot closer to me. Perfect. But they did not reappear. I never saw the two lights again. An experience never repeated.<br><br>And no, I did not have a camera ready. If I had, it would not have mattered. It all happened too fast, and would not have been discernible anyway. The conditions were impossible. <br><br>And yes, I could be lying. I could be mentally ill. I could have been drunk, or on drugs, or dreaming, or hallucinating. Maybe I&#39;m a prankster, or a troll. Maybe I&#39;m a narcissist after attention. Maybe I&#39;m a straight gay bisexual tranny looking to get a TV show. All of this could be true, and more. <br><br>Or maybe, the lights were a natural phenomenon. Along with the SPOTLIGHT straight out of Close Encounters. <br><br>Or maybe, it was an experimental government project of some kind. But I doubt it. This happened about 20 years ago. How would it be possible for our dumb-ass government to keep it a secret so long? Because if it has, I am impressed. It would be a first. Our government could not even keep nuclear weaponry a secret. Or e-mails.     <br><br>But that&#39;s my UFO story. It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t believe me. It&#39;s even okay if you don&#39;t believe I&#39;m 130 pounds lighter, thanks to my Gold&#39;s treadmill and Total Gym. Nobody in my life (sniff sniff) believes my UFO story either.

They existed in the past, the exist along side us in the present, or they are waiting to be formed in the future.<br>Part B- There are different kinds of aliens which may exist. Microbial, plant, small animal (unintelligent), large animal (unintelligent), and variations of the small and large animals with intelligence. This is to include all the more specific variations from one type of life to the other (in an evolutionary scale).\u00a0<br>Part C- The likelihood of discovering one of these aliens or the existence of it entirely depends upon the complexity of the organism. Meaning microbial organisms have the highest chances of being found and are more abundant than all the other species because they are the most simplistic lifeforms to exist. Here is an order which entails its complexity and likelihood of it&#39;s existence. Micro-organisms, plants, unintelligent small animals/large animals, intelligent animals.<br>Part D- Aliens (which are intelligent) have not made contact with us for these reasons:<br>-1. They have no benefit in doing so<br>-2. They do not know of our existence<br>-3. They have no way of doing so<br>-4. They are, but the transmission is taking light years to reach us<br>-5. They are not intelligent like mankind (meaning no existence of intelligent life)<br>-6. They did in the long history Homo Sapiens possess and have completed their objectives for having anything to do with us.<br>Part E- Extinction of some kind has wiped them out (refer to Part A where it says past) so we can only find remains of alien life<br><br>Conclusion: I believe they exist but in very small numbers and there is an even a smaller number which could pose to be intelligent if at all because they have yet to evolve or have already existed and have gone extinct (maybe they could repeat the evolutionary cycle to form again?). This means by the time mankind has a successful search (through probability). The hope is that we find microbial life before our extinction though which I believe can be done and that this form of alien life does exist.\u00a0<br><br>Part F- Bonus part!!!

I dont believe in God because of the storys the religions tell, lets take christs(dont know what its called in english)but lets take the storys of christs, they say that someone died and then lived again. Or a man building a giant boat on his own which holds 2 of every kind of animal, or a big star above where jesus is born so all jinds of people get there so what can mive stars now? And there are more examples. Now lets take aliens : I believe in aliens because the chance of them not existing is sooo slim, there are billions of galaxies containing billions of stars, where planets orbit around. So the possibility of there only being 1 planet which has intelligent lifeforns is really tiny, the chance is however even more slim that we will ever encounter or visit them because all the planets are so far apart, and for us to ever reach a planet with intelligent lifeforms we wouls have to go way way faster then the speed of light , or just the speed of light, which will be quite difficult because youybneed an infinte amount of energy to do that, and faster then light isnt possible, thee only possible way in my opinion to reach them would be like wormholes but im sceptix.

I heard about this theory a long time ago, so I may have it wrong and I don&#39;t know the name of it, but hear me out. This theory states that the universe is so huge, that nearly any probability becomes possible, however unlikely. For example, alien life is virtually certain according to the fundamental laws of probability. In addition, it is also very likely that there are aliens out there with human (or greater) intelligence. This <b>should</b> mean that we should have gotten a message from them by now. The likelihood is huge.<br><br>So why haven&#39;t we?<br><br>Well, the theory states that it may be that any intelligent civilization cannot progress to a point where inter-stellar travel is possible due to it depleting its planet&#39;s resources too fast. This is where it gets interesting. It could be happening to us right now. We are (arguably) on the brink of technological revolution. Within 20-30 years, things are going to be pretty crazy in the realm of science. I think this is true because of the theory that a civilization (such as the human race) progresses in the realms of sciences at the speed at which it can communicate. Therefore, scientific progress that would take 10-20-30 years in the 1800s where you had to send physical letters to people by post might only take 3-4-5 years when you can send entire bodies of work and hundreds of pages of research at the click of a button.<br><br>Now, to recap (please bear with me). We have the idea that a race cannot progress to the point where inter-stellar travel is possible, we have the knowledge that we are progressing scientifically faster than ever before, and the almost certainty that intelligent life exists out there. \u00a0<br><br>When you really think about it, it&#39;s a bit depressing. Alien life exists, but will ultimately kill itself before it can invent spaceships and we are likely to do the same. So, it seems the chances of us meeting alien life is near ZERO despite the fact tha aliens almost certainly exist out there.<br><br><br>(Just want to point out I may be wrong about the whole &quot;in the next 20-30 years&quot; prediction for amazing scientific things.

Um yes aliens exist cause think about it! The universe is sooooooooo big is soooo vast that there is like almost unlimited amounts of galaxies with unlimited amounts of solar systems just looking at space from the naked eye and the naked eye of the space telescope. I say there is aliens because they probably don&#39;t have a kind of technologies that we have like maybe as in TERM of technologies, their &quot;technologies is chemicals or stuff like that and they don&#39;t have some sort of signal radio waves to send some messages to us to Earth from their planet cause we&#39;re too too far from them. The aliens might have already made spaceships with their own technologies that we can&#39;t have because if their planet has materials that we don&#39;t have on the periodic table to make those kind of spaceships cause theirs might be more simple like a simple ship with complex controls or the other way around, who knows. And they might even colonized their solar system and a few other solar systems to colonize and why I say about that because they might have lived longer and more then millennium and years and years before earth was born or our solar system was born and still just don&#39;t have the technology to reach our planet earth. But if that&#39;s the case then some planets might have either intelligent aliens that might be communicating with sound waves to each other or with raspy voices or something I don&#39;t know I&#39;m just being creative.

They might have spaceships that runs only with magnetic storms outside in space instead of gas or any other chemicals use like we do. They might fly using just machines going back and forth in some ways. Who knows. The universe is such a big place and so much to think about.

If there is other life forms in our galaxy, then the planets formed Billions of years before ours would like have a more advanced race, meaning we are the primitive species. As we are on the edge it&#39;s more likely to find life in the centre of the galaxy. Good job we&#39;ve nearly depleted our natural resources because that leaves us with really nothing of interest that an alien race would want....

First, of the many life forms that could be out there, not all would be complex, multi-celled organisms. Among these, not all would be intelligent. Then, not all would be technologically advanced to the point of achieving space travel. Then, not all would have the resources or the interest to do so in a regular basis just for the sake of finding other life, due to the distances involved. So I think that it would take a lot of time for a species that meet this criteria to find another species, even a simple one. There is a possibility that humanity as a species cease to exist without ever finding other life.
