The reason the bottom side doesn\u2019t seem to move is because at the same time as it contracts upwards, it is pulled down by gravity.

When you let the slinky go, the energy is released and the mass begins to accelerate downward, but at the same time as the potential energy in the slinky is released.  Because of conservation of energy, the slinky resists falling to a lower level of energy until its excess energy is burned up, but this potential energy that held the slinky at its energy level is now kenetic energy and so the overall acceleration is still equal to that of a slinky that had no potential energy stored, which means it should hit the ground at the same time as a slinky dropped from the lowest part of the slinky.  The gravitational delay will be countered by an increased initial acceleration once the potential energy is gone (the slinky is collapsed again).<br>That&#39;s my theory anyhow, but i think it shows that mass isn&#39;t attracting mass, but instead that mass is interacting with an energy field that accelerates mass downward.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T20:29:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tim", "comment_text": "maybe its because it pulls up because its streched but at the same force falls down", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T19:44:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C\u00eaJota", "comment_text": "Drop the longest slinky from the longest building", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T19:22:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "[Insert Joke]", "comment_text": "Best vid I\u2019ve seen today", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T19:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred Cerutti", "comment_text": "Nope", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T18:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alpha gamer", "comment_text": "Even a slinky can defy gravity", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T17:53:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt L", "comment_text": "So gravity is lie?", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T17:47:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IDrinkAnarchy", "comment_text": "The shadow on his lovely coat tho....", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T17:18:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "*Elainne*", "comment_text": "Bom.

Dont forget that despite the struggles in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you&#39;ve done or what you&#39;re going through you CAN make it through Jesus. <br><br>If you have any questions let me know <br>X", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T22:41:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VanillaSaltyBalls", "comment_text": "This is the first YouTube video short that I don&#39;t hate.

Or would the pole break first because of the inertia of the mass at the ends--if so, how thick would the pole need to be to make it not break, and is that even possible? Is there a theoretical maximum length of a beam in space due to the lever effect resulting in &quot;too much&quot; movement of the opposite end? What if it were a 1k AU beam and the rotation would make the ends travel faster than light? If a beam couldn&#39;t support this and would break and a sphere would be so massive it would collapse into a black hole, what about a giant disc?

When I think about this effect from an Einsteinian perspective, it seems far less mysterious (even if special relativity is still mind-bending).  Before its release, the top of the slinky is being pulled, accelerated in fact, at a rate of about 10m/s\u00b2, against its natural geodesic path downward.  Each molecule of the slinky pulls on the next and eventually, the whole slinky is accelerating.  When the slinky is released, the top is no longer accelerating and molecule by molecule, the acceleration stops, and because of it&#39;s unusual shape and springiness, this re-contraction is visible to us.<br><br>We ourselves are like springs that are being contracted by being accelerated upwards.  We don&#39;t really notice this acceleration because we feel it constantly, but in fact when we are at rest, we are all being accelerated upward, away from our natural geodesic path to fall downward.  When that force is released and we find ourselves in free fall (like when an elevator going upward reaches the top or a roller coaster goes over a &quot;hill&quot;), we feel our bodies uncompress.  I wonder how fast a slow-motion camera would have to be in order to see the decompression wave of someone standing on a platform that was suddenly removed from beneath them and they started falling.  Their feet would start to fall slightly before their head and it would be possible to see a decompression wave move from their feet to their head, much the same way as with the slinky.

If you stand at the far end from the button and push the rod those 6 inches, you might think that pushing this rod would &quot;instantly&quot; press the button on the other end because through observation of very short rods (like a 1 foot rod for example), this is how it appears. As such, you&#39;d perhaps think that you have thus moved faster than light to press the button on the other end.  However, it doesn&#39;t work like this, and the rod you pushed at this end will take a very long time to transfer that force over it&#39;s length to the other end. Its crazy for me to think about, but the rod will visibly move on this end, while the other end will remain where it is until this compression force has time to pass from one end of the rod to the other. The compression force is basically a wave that travels at the speed of sound over the given material, so depending on the material of the rod if could take 50,000 years for the button to be pressed on the other end!

Of course, not all systems involving tension-only string-type materials are non-reversible in that sense: pulley setups, chain/gear setups, and even tug-of-wars can still be reversed and make sense, but a rope will never be able to push in the true sense, at least not at the scale of, say, a horse pulling a log. <br> I\u2019m assuming the twist came before wave because it was more rigid and less elastic in that direction, so that particular  dynamic of tension being released at the top, while gravity and the spring\u2019s equilibrium still holding tight down below and throughout until the longitudinal wave comes but the twist wave moves through the more rigid material faster.

If you extend a slinky lateraly and release its ends at the same time what will happen? Both ends contract to the centre if the slinky with a force that is equal to the mechanical force stored in its coils by the extention. When a slinky dangles by its own weight, the force stored is equal to the &quot;force&quot; of gravity pulling it down. So when we release the top end of the slinky both ends start to accelerate towards the centre of mass with acceleration proportional to the force stored. So the upwards acceleration of the bottom end due to the force stored is equal to the downwards acceleration due to gravity, hence it remains roughly immobile. But if you take the centre of mass which is in the middle of the slinky, it starts &quot;falling&quot; (or accelerating towards the Earth) at the moment of release.
