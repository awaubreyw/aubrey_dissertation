God explained to Human kind the only book by the way which explains explicitly the reason why All Men die... while at the beginning of creation Man was to live immortality that is never die, no sickeness,, no disaster , no ageing, no disability, no suffering and pain, our brain would be like geniuses; no weakness n blemish existed in the Plan of God when h\u00e9 designed and crafted Man in His Own Image. Then Our perfect great grandmother and great great grandfather rebelled against God their own creator; they decided they want to be their own God.. deceived by The Devil they have been fooled and lost all of the perfection and Sin entered the creation, livestock, and nature everywhere and everything has the signs of a Fallen creation.  some people die younger and other&#39;s Lucky to grow old  enough with their families. Obviously there are also cell information, and organs deterioration as well as Bone structures  begin to frail... these are the ways in which the body inevitably go towards ageing and oxidation... And reversing it: or slowing it does not mean we will avoid death..! On the contrary be not deceived ; Immortality and Resurrection of the body after death is a Free Gift that is promised by Jesus Christ through his crucifixion, death, burial and resurrection. He has been able to overcome Evil and all of its temptation; He is a holy and He is also the Son of God.. who left heaven to come and die An excruciating pain on that cross.  Because the Bible says that God so loved the world.. that he sent his one and only Begotten Son .. A saviour; to save us from Eternal darkness and mortality.. but to give to all those who acknowledge, receive Jesus as their Lord snd King in their heart.... is crowned a child of God.  It&#39;s no doubt that all humans on this earth has sinned and if you&#39;re not sure just cross examine yourself with the 10 commandments which are the moral law.. the perfect excellence of the Standard of God&#39;s Holiness. We all have hurt other people and also have offended them and Sinned against the God who gave us life and all the goodness on this earth. But One thing for sure we carry a soul which leaves the body and goes beyond.. And the Bible says there are 2 ways after this life ends on earth... and God has given us a Way a Ticket to Heaven. The perfect world.... so its up to anyone who reads to choose either the redemption road or the road that leads to perdition... if you choose to make things right with God... great koz he calls us to be his friend.. he also send you his Spirit to dwell and live in yoir heart and all the void, the nonsense of this world .. all the questions are answered in one Word. God loves you. Life is serious... if Good exist then Evil does. If God had to sent his own Son to pay for your debt and my debt.. is because he wants to also offer us Immortality... and Eternity.  A new world; a nee heaven and earth...will be established and then we shall see our King. The kingdom of God is ag hand.. believe and humbleness will save your soul. You ain&#39;t got nothing to lose.. on the contrary everything and more to gain. No matter how much Good works, good ordinances, good charity, or good thoughts can ever buy us a ticket into afterlife... no one can bribe God and he is also not a corrupt judge. God will also bring about judgement on those who are destroying this earth, ripping nations apart, making war for greed and benefits, murderers, terrorists, human traffickers, child traffickers, slavery and abduction; false testimony on other people.., genocides of nations; and most of all.... the abusive system of the law... rising up to control With fear!! We shall be accountable on that day... if you receive Jesus Christ now and today.. in your heart Just remember to ask him to transform your life, marriage, kids and all things in your life. God is Alive and his word has accompanied nations and empires in the ancient world.. so today he is working in every person&#39;s heart individually. However the Bible prophecied for End times.. The Apocalypse is also unfolding and many signs are coming to Pass... if you&#39;re still not convinced how volatile and fragile our lofe is.. then just pass your way and scroll down...Its all down to each person. But I believe in Science and God has given us brilliant doctors, Surgeons, dentists, Etcc for the good work to be done.. but Remember whenreverse ageing can have its limits, unknown implications too perhaps 50 more years added is great..provided this Earth wil still be breathable and livable by then... if not destroyed by more wars and terrorism..  but still nothing is comparable to a thousands Of  years Promised by God.. in Eternity where Time has no beginning and no End!

They are like animals that have no understanding between good and evil.\r<br>\r<br>Ecclesiastes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRt7LjqJ45k&amp;t=3m18s\">3:18</a>\r<br>I said in my heart, \u201cConcerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>They built their own nations and governments, wrote laws that they can only follow, and formed religions that they can only believe. Many of them even named themselves after the name of the Christ for believing they can live forever even without obeying the Law that the Lord Jesus gave to Moses. \r<br>\r<br>Exodus 3:14\r<br>And God said to Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM.\u201d And He said, \u201cThus you shall say to the children of Israel, \u2018I AM has sent me to you.\u2019 \r<br>\r<br>John 8:58\r<br>Jesus said to them, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>The result of disobedient life, people get sick, old and die without knowledge why these things happen to them. \r<br>\r<br>Job 36\r<br>If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.\r<br>\r<br>The Lord God who is the God of love showed mercy to them; He called Abraham out of the Gentile people and washed him by making him follow His laws and commandments.

Though its root may grow old in the earth, and its stump may die in the ground, yet at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant. But man dies and is laid away; Indeed he breathes his last and where is he?\r<br>\r<br>So, Israel became a teacher of the Gentile people to guide them to the path of truth where they can regain forever life. Israel committed sin by crucifying the Lord Jesus. The Lord God took His Kingdom from them and gave to the nation that will guide the people of Gentile to the truth.

I don&#39;t want to live in constant pain or great disability, and I don&#39;t want to out live my children.

What can you do? Well zinc is a catalyst and selenium is a catalyst zinc is heavy so if it is trapped in the wrong slot if you make that molecule fall deeper into its gravity well that can dislodge the Deuterium. What can make things go OUT of the gravity well or reduce gravity? Nothing. Ipso facto we&#39;re screwed aren&#39;t we.  Selenium will speed up your metabolism and speed it up and help with aging and counter the effects of zinc to some degree which will weigh you down in terms of energy. So if you take zinc Vitamin C and echinacea tablets 3 times a day for 3 weeks, you should notice that your mouth is forced open and gas is released as the Deuterium leaves your body and you might shed 10 years on your looks. Too much zinc is not good for you but that is a harmless enough proof for you. Remember you could need copper if you take too much zinc. Please don&#39;t ask me about vitamin D, it is the largest conspiracy on earth. It has nothing to do with aging but everything to do with COVID. see the vitamin D council see them say it causes flu and colds a shortage of vitamin D. Oh you take vitamin D3? No you don&#39;t it isn&#39;t vitamin D3 you just bought it just says so on the bottle.<br>Took cod liver oil? They remove the D from cod liver oil now.

No stomach aches, no runny noses, nothing except the odd light headache after stress... I just avoid the typical Western diet. In a way I find it weird, but I also look far younger than my age. I am in my early 30s and am often confused for a 19 year old (most recent estimate). I&#39;m often surprised by how different other people look born in the same year as me. Part of me thinks I just lucked out with good genes (I also have dark skin which might help), because sometimes I do eat a lot of plant foods from time to time (Greek hummus, Indian curries, unsalted crackers, PB&amp;J, Kale, Cilantro, Pistachios, Legumes, Ginger, Vegan Burritos) but I definitely think others should consider going plant based and see if they get similar results.<br><br>Also, I also strongly avoid candies, sodas/pop, and sweets. I drink A LOT of Itoen Japanese tea and water (no sugar). I do occasionally have oreos or nutri-grain bars with oatmilk or soymilk when I&#39;m in the mood for more sugar, but that&#39;s not often, and when I do eat it I always plan to walk or dance to music afterwards. I don&#39;t exercise much, so I imagine I could get even better health-span mileage. I do occasionally drink wines and Japanese alcohol, but don&#39;t like beers.

The Climate Changes you see on your news and all around you is caused by....get this....The Sun. Up until 2017, the climate was heating up. But in the later months of 2017 the climate stopped heating, remained steady for a bit and is now on the decline. The earth is cooling. The sun has a 100,000 year cycle. We are now at the very end of the lull between heating up and cooling down period. For 10,000 years our planet has enjoyed the 10% of this solar cycle, where the earth is warm. And now the sun is rapidly entering its Sleep Cycle, where it gets Cooler or Sleeps. And what happens when the sun Goes to Sleep? Earth, and the rest of the planets in our solar system enters an Ice Age for the rest of the sun&#39;s solar cycle, which is... NINETY THOUSAND YEARS !!! Why do you think all of these governments are making the D.U.M.B.&#39;S? (Deep Underground Military Bunkers) Because they know this truth and don&#39;t give a dam about anyone else but themselves and those super rich people who helped them build these bunkers. It&#39;ll be their Roach Motels, because once these individuals enter, they will never see the sun again, but their progeny will, in 90,000 years, if they even survive. There&#39;s a lot that can go wrong in these DUMBS. Any number of things can break and remain Unrepairable. Society or Civility can breakdown once they realize they&#39;ll never see the sky or the sun ever again. All sorts of unforeseen psychological problems can occur. Or there&#39;s a chance that the whole thing will cave-in and all that work and planning was for nothing. Just saying. But in a nutshell, wouldn&#39;t you rather know what&#39;s coming, in order for you to have the greatest chance of making plans and moving to a place which just might be within the scope of human survivability? I know I would. So here&#39;s your warning. Do something or do nothing. It&#39;s your choice.

Why do we age?  Does a healthy diet help? Should we wear sunscreen? Why do things help us live longer? <br><br>When we go outside the sun breaks apart our dna.We see the dna damage as why we age. New studies coming out show something a little different. <br><br>When our dna is damaged, it tries to rebuild itself. Since the dna is damaged, the epigenome/what houses and activates the dna, takes this role on rebuilding. <br><br>99% of the time it succeeds, and the other 1% is aging. What is thought is your dna cells forget what type of cell they are, although they/you are all the same dna. You have skin cells, brain cells, hair, etc. although they should rebuild the same everytime, they dont. We develope hair where it shouldnt be. Grey hair too. And develop other symptoms as well. So should we control the amount of activation of the epigenome/protect the epigenome if that is what effects aging? <br><br>First we have to test it. <br><br>The interesting part about bacterial evolution and how we tie in, is the development of bacterias two ways of life. A &quot;grow and reproduce&quot; and a &quot;protect and repair&quot;. These dormant genes are triggered by  physiological changes. Fires for example. <br><br>The 3 types of longevity genes in the epigenome are key to &quot;longevity&quot;.  they control the general &quot;defensive measures&quot;. <br><br>The 3: information genes that rebuild. Amino acid regulator genes for eating meats and the glucose genes for energy lvls. <br>These genes turn on and off things. They tell us hidden things like how low cellular glucose lvls means we are tired and hungry. Hot vs cold. <br><br>By controlling the cellular controls we can make aging happen faster or slower. <br> <br>So now scientist are experimenting on animals. It is hard to control/protect all portions of the epigenome. <br><br>Scientist first want to see if they can increase aging to test their theory. by creating a mouse that is susceptible to minor minor gene damage where it repairs 99% vs mutates, they tested their theory. <br><br><br>As it turns our, its just like the doc tells you. By turning on your cellular defenses, it protects the epigenome and reduces aging. So in our mice/rats and monkeys, they dramatically reduced aging by introducing intermittent fasting/reducing the amount of time they eat, calories, limiting amino acid intake, and to keep it a little bit cool. <br><br>Does this mean fish is bad? Why do some islands in japan have the highest life expectancy? Green tea, cigarettes, and fresh fish? So many questions. <br><br>What if we made a controlled experiment, where monkeys were cholericly restricted and cooled, vs a gluttonous monkey group that was able to eat whatever they wanted. <br><br>They did and the skinny and fit group way out performed the other. <br><br>What next what if we developed a molecule that acted as a inhibitor to activate our defenses without &quot;fasting&quot;. <br><br>Well we have! (For mice) A very very old mouse ran over 3km, 50% further than any mouse they tested, way out performing the untreated. They compared it to a 70 neating a 20yr old in a marathon by 50%. <br> <br><br>So now we are left with us. Isnt this evolutions, and darwinism? The physiological changes Darwin  saw in the Galapagos, pushed animals to develop. Now we have a &quot;serum&quot; in the works the works for us. <br><br><br>So <br>#1 avoid dna damage. Xrays, sun, anything that damages or changes your dna. <br><br>#2 eat less :-/<br><br>#3 eat less protein <br><br>#4 high intensity exercise training<br><br>#5 be hot or cold ( must sweat or chill) this could be just not wearing a jacket in winter. <br><br><br>Pretty cool doc talk riiiight?

If the brain is merely the primary interface between the corporeal body and incorporeal mind, in much the same way as the CPU is the central processing system that translates inputs from external to the computer into different behaviors within the computer, and different output signals from the computer to the external user, then transferring consciousness by simply mapping neurons would never work.  And there is no evidential reason for concluding that the mind is the brain, while there are solid philosophical arguments against this assumption, as well as a lot of evidentiary reasons drawn from scientific experiments for questioning that assumption.

My current biological age is 19 years old. Here&#39;s my timeline so far in terms of benefits: <br><br>Since my start, it took my body 2 and a half weeks to adapt to the change and feel any benefits but then I woke up one day roughly 2 weeks later and had plenty of energy. This baffled me since that night I only got 5 hours of sleep. With all of this energy, I wasn&#39;t hyper but more clearer-minded and restful. I would go as far as to say I felt like I had the same energy as I did when I was 12. <br><br>After those 2 and a half weeks, the next big change for me was constantly dreaming. For 9 straight days, I had at least 2 dreams per night which was unheard of for me and I was low key excited for what would happen next. During this time, I noticed how after lunchtime around midday, I didn&#39;t have a drop in energy. Previously, I had attended school and as soon as my lunch break had ended and I made it to the next period, I used to get a wave of lethargy and often dozed off to sleep for a quick power nap. What happened next really changed me. Due to my sleep schedule fixing itself gradually, my circadian rhythm was fixing itself and I had begun to feel tired earlier which took me by surprise. <br><br>Following this abundant change, about a week later I noticed that I would watch Netflix shows and YouTube in a whole different way. Before this experiment for myself, I would most of the time watch a show and remember some details unless something drastic happened in what I was watching or doing in general but something changed. My memory of recollecting what had happened was so much better as now I wouldn&#39;t just remember minor details but I would be able to remember the characters names even a couple months after watching the show. In my day-to-day life, my improved memory helped me remember orders I would write down since I&#39;m the &quot;Uber Eats&quot; for the family, driving to and from restaurants and picking up food for us. <br><br>Going forward, I recently started taking this other oral supplement called Resveratrol that David Sinclair also takes which I&#39;ll have to do more research on. I know this is all anecdotal evidence and it&#39;s not concrete evidence but these have been the benefits 3 months into taking this NAD+ booster as supplementation. Since the start, these benefits felt like they have compounded as I feel incredible! <br><br>Once I stopped taking Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) from TruNiagen, I followed up with taking the larger molecule Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) sublingual in 600mg doses daily for the next 7 months. During that time, I noticed that I didn\u2019t have any stomach cramps like I did while taking NR by Tru Niagen; in fact, the NMN that I took sublingually (under the tongue) had lemon flavoring so it was a nice mid-day treat!<br><br>As of this week, I ordered NAD+ supplementation through Alive By Science on their website. The shipment should get to my house in the next few days I can\u2019t wait! I ordered a new type of supplementation absorption method which is called \u2018Liposomal NAD+\u2019 on their website and it utilizes a phospholipid shield which surrounds the active ingredient (NAD+ precursors) so it won\u2019t get broken up in the stomach and can be absorbed \u20183-5 times better\u2019 than traditional supplements which use pills. I plan on taking their Transdermal skin products that have NAD+ in them too so I can get rid of sun damage on my hands. I\u2019m thoroughly excited to try this out so I can extend my health and lifespan! <br><br>Feel free to ask me any questions at all about anything I mentioned or if you\u2019re curious about anything! Since the start, these benefits felt like they have compounded as I feel incredible!

The main reason for pollution, droughts, and deforestation is animal agriculture. About 85% of antibiotics (which are synthetic ones that destroy good bacteria too) go to animal agriculture. <br><br>Even then, plenty of cancer tumors and other things that get unchecked or barely treated before it&#39;s sent out to the public. That&#39;s while the meat literally rots as it sits around getting moved around until it&#39;s bought.

The age of a species is an evolutionary outcome within a given range of various parameters, including population, relative health span of adults, age profile and death rates of infants, etc. Modern medical devices hugely impact those factors and changing balance and as consequence, the natural health span will most likely be reduced. Bar any loopholes in our biology that evolution had overlooked, you need to become a jellyfish to live longer. Here is how another study expresses the same: Species longevity has been determined and conserved by millions of years of evolution and hence cannot be significantly improved, whatever we do. It is true that millions of years of evolution have resulted in longevity and health assurance systems of amazing complexity and efficacy. Although these systems cannot be perfect, it is extremely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will be able to significantly improve such systems when their performance is at its peak. The rest of the causes of longevity presented is circumstantial. It&#39;s a biological viewpoint so to speak. You might as well visit blue zones and discover that eating healthy food and having some genetic predisposition is a guarantee of longevity of the locals.

In rodents, resveratrol decreased cardiovascular risk factors, improved cardiovascular function and physical capacity, and decreased inflammation, that is, it improved vascular function. But when it was put to the test with people, practically the opposite happened.<br>More specifically, combining resveratrol with sports training destroyed the reductions in blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides often associated with training; it had a more constricting effect on the arteries than a dilator; and &quot;led to a significantly smaller increase in exercise-induced oxygen uptake.&quot;<br>Rodents taking resveratrol perform better in sports, but in humans, resveratrol produces a 45% decrease in maximal aerobic capacity.

Another problem is more children are solely being raised by their grandparents and great grandparents regardless of whether their parents are alive, definitely impacting the mentality. Women and men are having children well past their fifties, another cause of unforeseen consequences. The biggest problem I see by far in people living even longer will be with the population. It may cause the population to stagnate, it may cause overpopulation, but I doubt the population will stabilize. Either way, nature deigned that we grow old and die, and nature&#39;s balance is much more stable than human&#39;s balance.

The tips he gave about HIIT, limit sun exposure, be a little hot/cold, etc are great to try to achieve that, but what would be de point of resetting your whole organism so as to be forever young? I know that for some people that sounds like a dream come true, but if you are 70 and you reverse your whole body to feel (and look?) like a 20 year old, you&#39;d be ok with it the first few years but then you&#39;d feel doomed for having to do it all over again. And even if there are some people who feel perfectly fine with reaching 80 years old and then clocking back to 20 as if they were just going to the bakery to get bread, is it ethical to the world and future generations? I&#39;m not trying to be solemn about it, it&#39;s just that I can&#39;t imagine how there would be enough resources for everyone. How are supposed, let&#39;s say, newly graduated doctors to ever get a job when there are hundreds of &#39;80 years olds&#39; who have way more experience than them and they now have the energy and sharpness of a 20 year old? A true answer in today&#39;s world would be &#39;let them compete and let the best one win&#39;. Sure, I support competition, it&#39;s what&#39;s made the world less poor each year that passes, but I think we all support competition only when it&#39;s given under fair circumstances for all and no one really has the complete and full upper hand. Well, that wouldn&#39;t be the case with the doctors&#39; example. <br>I love this type of channel and videos, but they always fail to ask those important bioethic questions to the researchers; questions about the project itself and the ethical ones are compatible, not exclusionary. Both can be asked in the same interview. <br>Researchers tend to claim that it&#39;s not their field to review those types of concerns so they dismiss it (among their peers in academic environments) and leave it to professionals who are solely dedicated to bioethics. I would think that a youtube channel presentator (or any media presentator for that matter) is the perfect person to ask those kinds of questions since researchers tend to feel more &#39;obliged&#39; to answer rather than just dimiss it. I believe it would be a great idea for a video to make one that shows the opposite side of research like this.

Or who will go forth to the battle to fight without a breastplate on? If he is found, will he not be killed because he despised the service of the king? Likewise, no one is able to enter the holy place if he is double-minded. The one who is double-minded in his prayer is darkness to himself. And even the angels do not trust him.

I traveled. \r<br>Wanted to see the world. \r<br>I remember it only being one world back then. \r<br>Back in the good old time as some people from an eternity ago would call it.\r<br>I was happy on my journey. \r<br>Did I work?

What was it called? The Eternity? It doesn&#39;t matter. \r<br>There were fewer and fewer transmissions and then it stopped. \r<br>But in the blink of an eye we had the next mission to spread humanity out there. 20 years? Maybe 30.\r<br>But we were determined. \r<br>I remember the first colony. \r<br>Alpha Centauri if I&#39;m correct.\r<br>I couldn&#39;t wait to get there. \r<br>Wandering earth for over 300 years I had gotten a bit bored. \r<br>I spent a couple of hundred years traveling between the new colonies that were established one by one. \r<br>It took more than one human lifetime to get from one to the other. \r<br>I watched people being born. Grow. And then die. \r<br>Many faces. \r<br>All faded.\r<br>I remember there being a war but I lost interest in current epoch. \r<br>I was obsessed with human history. \r<br>It had doubled or tripled from back when I was born. There was a lot of knowledge and wisdom to learn from. \r<br>That kept me occupied for a couple of years. \r<br>My next real memory is from what? \r<br>My 1700s?\r<br>Our first contact. \r<br>I think I was part of it. \r<br>If I felt back then as I feel now, I was probably bored and looking for new discoveries. \r<br>I remember language being the largest barrier. \r<br>Did they even speak? \r<br>But we somehow managed. \r<br>And others followed. \r<br>Almost as many civilizations as stars in the night sky. \r<br>Some rose. Some fell. \r<br>I watched. Trying to keep out of it. \r<br>I think there was a short time where I tried my hand at being a guide and wanted to unite all of them. \r<br>That didn&#39;t go entirely as planned. \r<br>But it didn&#39;t matter. \r<br>A couple of wars and hundred of years later there it was. \r<br>A unified galaxy. \r<br>Art. Philosophy. Technology. \r<br>We thrived. \r<br>There was no more us. \r<br>No more them. \r<br>There was only we. United.\r<br>The entire galaxy one hive. \r<br>Guided by an unbound will to progress. \r<br>What my home country was to me back in my infancy the galaxy was to us now. \r<br>Somewhere along this time part of us started to merge with machines. \r<br>We let them. \r<br>I remember milkdromeda. \r<br>Our hives quickly merged. \r<br>Both of us having long lost any use for war. \r<br>But after thousands of years I got bored again and left the hive.\r<br>I stepped away from progressing forever onward.\r<br>I again traveled.\r<br>I left our galaxy.\r<br>Just set out into space and... Went.\r<br>I drifted for an eternity.\r<br>Alone on the void.\r<br>I think I found other galaxies.\r<br>All of them teeming with live.\r<br>I watched. Studied.\r<br>Some were tribes some had formed one galaxy spreading consciousness.\r<br>All of them had names.\r<br>None I remember.\r<br>At some point the distance between galaxies had become too vast to travel and I decided to remain where I was.\r<br>Spent another couple trillion years here.\r<br>Mostly bored.

The health promises of boosting an important metabolic molecule may be clouded by its possible role in promoting cancer-cell growth. Rugang Zhang of the Wistar Institute, and his colleagues found that in cells entering senescence, rising levels of NAMPT (a major NAD+-producing enzyme in mammals) encourage the release of inflammatory and potentially protumor molecules. Consistent with those findings, mice genetically predisposed toward pancreatic cancer developed more precancerous and cancerous lesions when they consumed the NAD+ precursor NMN. Zhang says more research is needed to fully understand the role of NAD+ in cancer, but he adds that \u201cwe should be cautious and bear in mind the potential downside of NAD+ supplementation as a dietary approach for antiaging.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cancer-research-points-to-key-unknowns-about-popular-antiaging-supplements/\">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cancer-research-points-to-key-unknowns-about-popular-antiaging-supplements/</a> NAD+metabolism governs the proinflammatory senescence-associated secretome <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6448588/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6448588/</a> A \u2018Fountain Of Youth\u2019 Pill? Sure, If You\u2019re A Mouse. Despite his enthusiasm, published scientific research has not yet demonstrated the molecule works in humans as it does in mice. Sinclair, however, has a considerable financial stake in his claims being proven correct, and has lent his scientific prowess to commercializing possible life extension products known as NAD+ boosters and Sirtuin activators. \u201cNone of this is ready for prime time. The bottom line is I don\u2019t try any of these things,\u201d said Felipe Sierra, the director of the division of aging biology at the National Institute on Aging at NIH. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I?

The balance of effector and regulatory T cell function, dependent on multiple signals and epigenetic regulators, is critical to immune self-tolerance. Dysregulation of T helper 17 (Th17) effector cells is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. These findings reveal an unexpected proinflammatory role of SIRT1 and, importantly, support the possible therapeutic use of SIRT1 &#39;inhibitors&#39; against autoimmunity. <a href=\"https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419343/pdf/JEM_20132378.pdf\">https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419343/pdf/JEM_20132378.pdf</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T05:26:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kennedy Kerry", "comment_text": "I want to put Rite Aid reversing stuff into my body I want to be able to go back to being 15 years old again I want to be able to live for 500 to A Thousand Years", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T05:22:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tarruvi \u03c8", "comment_text": "A wrinkle to longevity, is outside factors.

There is a lot to the psychology of a man that is not know to many people because they lose it by being groomed into a person by their mother. Aka another being of a equal and opposite nature. This is as you stated with microorganisms splitting into 2. That was the beginning of sexuality. Male and female, and I\u2019m very young and haven\u2019t done much thinking for things as diverse as you have but the thing about this knowledge we think we all know is only an observation of what was seen. The reality of what was happening is quite the opposite of what is thought to be happening. There is much that we think that is not. The reason cells in your body begin to change and form randomly around your body is because you have no identity of your physical being. You never relearned to harness all the sensation we once knew as babies. It was blinded by fake love our mothers give, which is make you happy now to make you feel better, a bandaid on a stab wound. We as men are the emotional being of the 2 in our brains. We are a woman in our brains. And a woman a man in her brain. What is thought to be a man in society today. But we are not hunters. That is why we evolved from that, but the trend remains throughout society in means of getting a woman. But that was the woman using the cards she was dealt to benefit her. Her card being the one that can do the deed and commit the act of evil (aka deceit in a mans world) and made is think we were dogs for wanting to enjoy and have sex and reproduce as you said.

I don&#39;t think memories are stored exactly.  They are just the combination of millions of neurons firing in a pattern that includes neurons that typically control our 5 senses.  A memory is like an after image on an old crt that has been unplugged.  I guess the &quot;keys&quot; to these combinations of lit up neurons must be stored somewhere though, but I don&#39;t think memories are stored in some kind of hard drive in one location of the brain.", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T22:43:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Peter Rabbit", "comment_text": "Prof Sinclair is 50, looks 35, and his biological clock says he&#39;s 31.

The past 100 years has diluted C-14 about double extending longevity of those 30 and under to about age 240. The astral impact releasing magma carbon and burning all oil fields next year will restore the 400 before doubling to 900.<br><br>Noah living 350 years unaffected by what he eats proves that the carbon he ate was burned and released. This means atomic and molecular cells that die and break down are reused by surrounding cells so that environment food cannot change ADULT body mass already built without C-14. The formula was proven on my Commodore 64 in February 1985. No one cared. So fruck em all. The asteroid is now here. The first damage to human life causing aging from 600 to 900 was caused by Satan and other angels coming down when Adam was 390 and making flesh from nitrogen. By doing so the cellular structure constantly died from C-14 and had to be retained by angelic restoration thus creating the toxin in food that aged humans to die at 900. It is why Enoch told them to go home back to heaven. The Flood was not to punish man, but to rid angels. Now back in spirit, their challenge is a race to see who humans hear easier from, from God, or from them. They are racing to justify their reason they had been on Earth. This is why sometimes it is the evil that attempts to warn us of the asteroid as if they can before God does.  PreFlood atmosphere had 2x to 3x pressure from 45 inches to 60 inches of water above us.

If you research the legends of eastern alchemy, you&#39;ll find that they involve subjecting oneself to behaviors that simulate times of famine. They restrict their calories, especially meat. They excercise regularly and breathe deeply. They also have daily rituals that agitate the tissue all over their bodies, including thorough, total-body self massage, and through meditative body awareness and precision muscle control exercises. <br><br>Finally, perhaps the last piece of the puzzle: they very infrequently allow themselves any sexual stimulation. If you think about it, that makes sense, if the rejuvenation mechanisms of our biology switch on during times when conditions are not ideal for raising children. One could envision the body reversing its own aging process so that you&#39;ll be in prime mating condition when the rough times are finally over. So all you have to do is keep tricking your body into thinking you&#39;re living in some kind of post-apocalyptic famine that never ends.

Some of the things on his list fly in the face of actual, like, you know, experiences.<br><br><br>First, calorie restriction.  Besides the obvious matter of living your life hungry.....no, thanks!....one of the first proponents who did so for several decades died in his early sixties of multiple nasty health issues.  I sure wish I could remember enough to provide a name, links, or something.  I will offer the thought that the other health issues were not related to calorie restriction, but when they happened, his system was too weak to counter them.<br><br><br>Second, amino acid restriction.  OK, maybe for maximum life span, but definitely NOT for maximum &quot;health span.&quot;  (I believe Dr. Peter Attia came up with that term, or at least took it and ran with it.)  We not only need adequate amounts of protein to counter the otherwise inevitable age related sarcopenia, we need even more than when young.  The alternative is declining strength which leads to falls, which leads to broken bones due to...........lack of protein as that is what bones are mostly made of.   I&#39;d sure rather live ten fewer years healthy than suffer issues like that. <br><br><br>Dr. McDougall of &quot;The Starch Solution,&quot; .......that&#39;s amino acid restriction at work........fell on his ass and fractured and broke several bones.  When I was 71, just under the doctor&#39;s age then, I had two hypotensive moments and fell on my ass twice.  I shook my head and got up.  <br><br><br>Amino acid restriction also is not indicated as healthy when you look at the likes of Joe and Charlene Anderson and other multi-decade carnivores.  More and more are coming out of the woodwork due to the intertubes.  All the women look stunning.  One I saw recently, herself a doctor, was 55 and hot in a bikini.

This relates to everything - from the Inflation Theory, Higgs Model, Particle Physics (standard model), General Relativity, Special Relativity and the Nobel Prize Winner Dr. Riess and the Type 1a Supernova (SN1a) distances measurements. SN1a are used for calibration of the Cosmological Ruler d(z) or distance versus redshift.<br><br>SN1a detonates when they reach the Chandrasekhar Mass Limit and that has a G^{-3/2} . This means that in a model where G is epoch-dependent, the SN1a have to be adjusted to comply with that. They cannot behave as Stellar Candles.  This article states in its Abstract, that it tested epoch-dependent G while forcing SN1a to remain Stellar Candles.  This means that the most important article (the one that saves General Relativity), the Logical Flaw is displayed right on the Abstract.  <br><br><br>No Giant Brains or digging is required.

An important caveat is that it rests on the assumption that the same mass of 56Ni is burned to create the standard candle regardless of redshift.<br>############################################<br>I also refuted the Lunar Ranging paper since it is both laughable and it does not refute epoch-dependent G (the allowed G-dependence is larger than the predicted local G epoch-dependence)<br><br>Here is my objection (Peer-Review)<br><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-could-this-article-pass-peer-review-Is-the-conclusion-one-of-its-assumptions/answer/Marco-Pereira-1\">https://www.quora.com/How-could-this-article-pass-peer-review-Is-the-conclusion-one-of-its-assumptions/answer/Marco-Pereira-1</a><br>and here is how an epoch-dependent G model (mine) shows that astronomical observations refute Einstein&#39;s Equations and thus refutes General Relativity.<br><br>If you look close enough, the WHOLE PHYSICS is held together with Chewing Gum.", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T16:01:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vincent Gill", "comment_text": "It has been reported that the Gods of the Sumerian civlization (Anunnaki) could live for thousands of years.

Some parts of the body repair very slowly or even not at all, so those areas you might need artificial replacements for whenever they go bad.<br><br><br>2) Another way is to go the cyborg/robot route and start replacing &quot;broken parts&quot; with manmade parts. Artificial heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, bones, pretty much everything can have an artificial version, yes, even the brain. Of course, our technology isn&#39;t there yet.<br><br><br>3) Yet another option is to consider extracting whatever it is that makes us &quot;us&quot; and implanting it into a virtual world where we can &quot;live forever&quot;. We really can&#39;t prove one way or another that we aren&#39;t already in such a world and that the death simulation is there to keep us thinking we are not in a simulation and we simply get &quot;transplanted&quot; into a new &quot;body&quot; afterward to continue life.<br><br><br>Personally, I like the cyborg route. If it were possible, I would totally transplant myself into a robot shell. If anything ever breaks, simply replace it. If anything ever gets outdated, upgrade it. You will have no need for anything from the environment meaning you could travel space with no issues so long as you have spare parts and electricity. You could even have multiple full replacements for your robotic shell on standby to hop into should anything major go wrong with your current robot shell. One big drawback is the lack of ability to have sex, but the feelings of sex could be simulated I&#39;m sure.", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T04:03:28Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Leandro G", "comment_text": "If the 2 modes are &quot;Grow and Reproduce&quot; and &quot;Protect and Repair&quot;, does having sex induce you towards the first mode?

The father of enzymes. He&#39;s the reason that we know about them. And hes found that when we have to use our enzymes to break down and digest cooked food, we actually accelerate our aging. See enzymes are in raw food. But when you cook anything over 118 degrees, you destroy those enzymes and you then have to use your own enzymes instead, which accelerates your aging. We are frugivores unlike what mainstream science says. We are like apes and we are supposed to only eat vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds. And since when does any species cook food? None of them do except for arrogant humans who believe they can do whatever they want. Well we now know that if you choose to cook your food, there are consequences. You will age twice as fast, and one of the main reasons we get cancer is because of cooked food. Cooked food becomes indigestible proteins. And the only cell that can get rid of the amount of these proteins is cancer cells because cooked food is all we eat so there is a non stop attack on the body. A great point that Dr Edward Howell made was saying that no animal in the wild ever gets sick. The only animals that get sick and get diseases are humans, and animals who are taken care of by humans. Eating a raw vegan diet, which is the only natural diet for humans, you can age at half the age you normally age and you then begin to age naturally. If you look up long time raw vegans, you will see that they look very young for their age. Most of the time looking half their age.<br><br>Here is a video of Annette Larkins, a 27 year raw vegan that is 70 years old that i would say looks 40 or 50.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSLhmahsiY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSLhmahsiY</a><br><br>Here is a video of Lou Corona who has been raw for about 40 years.

Best video on anti-aging ive yet come across. well <a href=\"http://done.im/\">done.im</a> terminally ill so this is important to me. can you tell me what intermittent fasting method the mice research doctor was using for himself or recommended as best. and how did he himself reverse his biological age from fifties to thirties. did he do the gene therapy-resetting of epigenomes on himself??he reversed the aging in the mouse significantly by using three out of four of yamanaka&#39;s factors. theres no reason that would not work on humans so its doable now.its just that people are too afraid of doing this stuff. . Im first trying to fix one feature of one of my neurological illness occipital neuralgia-  very severe form of it, which gives me suicidal seizure inducing vomiting pain levels. the dysfunctional  intercranials nerves that run from my traps, all over head to the eyes, but mainly focus on base of head, im thinking after watching this that i could trick my body into fixing <a href=\"http://them.by/\">them.by</a> targeting the base of head and neck in strength and resistance training to the extent of causing damage to the area, the same damage from say overdoing deadlifts so you cant bend your back and need a week off the gym. im hoping that will trigger my body to fix my dysfunctional nerve branch, which otherwise for some reason my body is refusing to fix it. and i was already aware of the telomere problem as i have actually spent a year on a telomeraise supplement called TA sixty five that aims to maintain or rebuild parts of  telomere caps on the end of chromosomes. But as your video pointed out, this seems to not be the main source of aging and at best has a very minor effect on anti-aging, probably one percent or something. so ive discontinued. i&#39;ve ordered NMN molecule, which is readily available even in chewable tablet form. The best way to be too hot and too cold is to go to sauna and then cold shower and do repeatedly for like an hour a day. That would really stimulate the anti-aging factor. I really love the cold and rain , i hate heat and i suffer heat stroke really easily and have a heat and sunlight phobia and severe photosensitivity which causes me seizures so even in winter now in London United Kingdom i do not use any heating in my apartment and often still have the window open as i love to hear the sound of the rain. its been down to three degrees celsius so far, but im still in t shirt and shorts. i find a coat and trousers too warm. for next summer i need to make sure im prepared with a air cooling unit. we dont have aircon in our houses here. im looking at a very good portable stand up unit which works by feeding it water so i can keep my room down to five degrees celsius even in the worst summer heatwave. i was in hospital seven times this summer gone for heat stroke, two of them requiring intensive care. despite drinking plenty of fluids. I&#39;m still looking into the best intermittent fasting strategy. i already go long periods not eating-twenty four hours-forty eight hours when i run out of food and am in too much pain and my brain isnt working because of my severe neurological illness, so i can neither work a computer to order food, phone or go to supermarket at those times. but once i can get food i tend to gorge, not alot at once since i have a very small stomach capacity, but i continuously eat very small amounts non stop throughout the day, like i always have snacks-cold ready made pancakes and biscuits to hand and eat them as regularly and compulsively as a cinema-theatre snack, and i drink four-six large monster energy drinks per day, i didnt used to be that way. i am and was very nutritionally aware of all the best diets. and i was super fit and healthy. i had a body fat percentage of ten percent and did not have the sugar addiction i have now. but now i feel so sick all the time, and food obviously being a comforting thing, im finding it almost impossible to break my sugary carb comfort eating,  and then how i can do high intensity interval training when im so in pain, nauseus, dizzy and with balance problems. im going to try to make it as short a session as possible by doing a set of ten one hundred metre sprints but at one hundred percent maximum effort just outside my apartment block so i can quickly return to apartment if im collapsing from pain and throwing up from the strain of it. day.these sprints would mimick the daily activity of a lion.  as someone who was a university sportsman in fencing, hockey,  sixty and one hundred metre track sprinting,  and military fitness and strength training, i know HIT is by far the most effective exercise form-its pretty much the only form that works to burn fat at satisfying rates.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T21:18:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "albusai", "comment_text": "I\u2019m 48 I smoke a little like three cigarettes a day , drink a little, I exercise a lot and sleep a lot , I eat very little carbs , lots of avocado \ud83e\udd51, I think genes has a lot to do", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T21:16:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dfgdfg", "comment_text": "patagonia, patagonia, patagonia.... something about cells", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T21:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deepu raj", "comment_text": "human population : am I a joke to you ?", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T20:52:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael&Jello", "comment_text": "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T20:51:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jakub Terchovan", "comment_text": "No matter how long we will live, the last judgement is waiting!", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T20:45:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Averylargewood", "comment_text": "Does this mean there is a potential cure for MS?", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T20:42:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avaldemon", "comment_text": "&quot;Let no man forget how menacing we are, we are lions!

You say humans have not done these claims to stop aging, however the most ancient of cultures with modern descent have done and continue to do some of these habits.

I guess your main audience is occidental and this applies to them more than to orientals or peoples from the middle east. <br>Now, I switch to epigenetics: Even if mice and other mammals have shown to be great models for medicine and human physiology, the similarities are mainly attributed to our shared parts of the genomes. The epigenome is another monster we&#39;re talking about, with its own evolutionary history throughout life on Earth. Take insects as an example, which share a lot of similarities regarding genes of enzymes involved in epigenetic processes. Even though they use the same genetic machinery to add/delete and edit epigenetic marks, they use these for very different reasons. Insects use epigenetic landmarks very differently, and that&#39;s why you don&#39;t see any mammals going through metamorphosis or involved in a larval growth phase (among other things). This is also the case with cloning, and the failure to clone humans. Evidence suggests that this could be because of the asymmetry of genomic imprints of the gametes. Thus requiring a viable male and female complementary imprints that successfully get the embryo machinery going (or both having male and female identical twins as subjects, maybe?). <br>Anyways, thanks for the updates regarding trans-humanism and the strife against the dust and ashes!", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T17:28:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daltira", "comment_text": "Extremely rare tip.......

Doing so will not only increase risk of high blood pressure, but strokes and heart diseases as well because of how quickly it is occurring.

They can regenerate, and the do have senescence only through genetic fatigue. However, it is likely to be possible to reduce genetic deviation and damage over time by bolstering genetic supports and improving the removal and replacement of senescent cells.

If we can &#39;hack&#39; the genome, there&#39;s no end to what we could accomplish. Nature and billions of years of evolution have fine-tuned the potential of creatures to an impossible level. Honestly, the possibility of giving people longer, healthier lives is just the tip of the iceberg. We could give people what amounts to superpowers, in theory. We could potentially some day get around the &#39;automated&#39; systems in the body that cause parts to atrophy when not in use, and stop the excessive buildup of fat storage, or at least make the body prioritize that fat storage more actively. We could activate our innate ability to change our perception of the passage of time and make it accessible via conscious effort. Anything that any human has been shown to physically be able to do, from withstanding incredible heat or cold for extended time to amazing feats of strength or resilience, it&#39;s all technically feasible, if completely out of the realm of what we can even think of doing right now. It seems like we&#39;re on that path, and it&#39;s really exciting to think that our species could become something greater like that. It could make it that much more possible to one day have humans create a new colony among the stars. I don&#39;t even care if it&#39;s something that has to start at birth, and I never get to enjoy the benefits of this advancement personally. If we can make the species better, more likely to continue our survival in a happier and non-harmful way, I absolutely want that for the coming generations. <br><br><br>What if we had computers that were brains? Brains that were computers? What if we found a totally different way to get the energy we need for our bodies? What if we didn&#39;t need sleep? What if we never got sick or old?

That means each and every one of us has a similar right to life from the moment of our gestation until the moment of our dying natural death.<br>       Nobody should have to power to determine when a &quot;person&quot; should have an ending to his life.  The right to life is not a human granted right.  It&#39;s a right that is an innate part of the human condition.  This should logically and scientifically mean that any &quot;person&quot; has the right to exist on our earth from the moment of conception until the last moment of his/her last dying breath on this planet.  <br>           This &quot;right&quot; is derived from our nature.  It&#39;s not a right that is subject to a vote of the majority of the people.  It&#39;s a natural right that nobody can justify to terminate.  From the moment of conception until our natural death, no matter what faults or crimes any of us have committed while we have existed on this Earth. This right cannot be logically opposed, no matter how hard opponents argue.  The  right to life exists from the &quot;moment of our natural conception until our natural death&quot;.  No matter how horrible the person has committed nasty criminal offenses, we have no right to terminate any person&#39;s  lowly lives.  This is coming from a conservative person.  I admit I&#39;m a Catholic Christian, but I &quot;stand by my guns&quot;.  Life begins from human conception until natural death.  If a horrible criminal should commit a horrible offense, then let him pay his dues in a jail cell that is 10x10.  Give him food and enough space to prevent &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; but let him pay the fine.  There is a fine line between &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; and &quot;paying your dues&quot;.  I&#39;m no bleeding heart liberal, but I don&#39;t believe in killing other human beings, unless it&#39;s necessary to save the life or lives of other innocent persons. For example an invasion of a home to save the lives of persons who would harm us.  Or persons who would invade a bodega in order to steal and kill others ruthlessly.

Although on a side note, i noticed the professor was pushing NMN, which is a commercially available supplement (and Prof Sinclair has financial interest in the product, he is listed as the inventor on the patent by the main company selling it. Also he is an investor in the company he uses to measure his aging). That&#39;s not to say the entire thing is bunk, it likely has merit, but too often scientists selling something will oversimplify things to get people to buy an ineffective product. There has supposedly also been research into aging involving build-up of certain chemicals which is where the &#39;young blood transfusions&#39; started to gain traction, though regular transfusions has a lot of danger. I&#39;m curious if they could use a person&#39;s stem cells to create bone marrow outside the body (basically a test tube femur or the like), supply it with nutrients so it keeps producing red blood cells, then doing a &#39;drain and fill&#39; on people using their own blood that is effectively &#39;young blood&#39; since it came from a source without all the build-up of those harmful chemicals. If possible it seems like it would have a lot of potential though be extremely expensive and likely time consuming.

Many elderly people suffer from decreased muscle mass and bone density, and reducing their (most likely already-low) dietary protein intake even more is not a good idea. Could it help slow down aging? We can&#39;t even say that for sure, but even if so - how will this slower aging look like? What&#39;s the point of living longer if the quality of life is dramatically reduced? I, personally, don&#39;t know if I&#39;d want to extend my lifespan knowing that I&#39;ll be quite disabled or not as independent as I could be had I done things differently. The TL;DR is that the data currently suggests that a high protein intake is safe and actually required in order to support the demands imposed on the body from physical activity. In addition to that, saying &quot;eat less&quot; can also be harmful without any context, as (I assume) there&#39;s a huge diversity in the audience seeing this video, and some of this audience may actually be calorie/nutrient-deprived. While it is true that the obesity epidemic keeps growing and becomes a bigger problem, we cannot make such bold, general statements on a public platform with that large of an audience.  I&#39;ll just conclude by saying (again) that I&#39;m a big VT fan, and that this isn&#39;t an attack or anything, but rather a call for responsibility-check and perhaps correcting some mistakes found in the video, or at least showing the bigger picture.", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T20:13:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Aboushanab", "comment_text": "&quot;There&#39;s mitochondrial dysfunction.

No. To grow a hair takes hundreds and thousands of cells working together around a follicle and producing a long chain of keratin/protein, a single hair. Cancerous tumors are the perfect example of this phenomenon, where a cell forgets its supposed to die, or at least not grow, and it grows out of control, destroying the adjacent cells in the process. Maybe skin blotches or failing eyesight and hearing could also be explained through this phenomenon, and probably a few other examples if I thought about it any more than typing up a comment, but he&#39;s lost me here.

Methylcobalamin (MeCb) is the active vitamer, or co-enzyme, that helps regulate DNA methylation. The other active vitamer, adenosylcobalamin (AdCb), is important for the upkeep of neurological remyelination (essentially, the myelin sheath surrounding white matter gets damaged, and AdCb is the co-enzyme that helps repair the myelin). There are two other vitamers (hydroxocobalamin or OHCb, and cyanocobalamin or CNCb), which are inactive, meaning they play no role in enzyme functionality - however all four vitamers are interchangeable. <br>B12 deficiency has really terrible outcomes - neurological effects such as dementia, or even coma and death from AdCb deficiency, and pernicious anemia from MeCb deficiency. On the flipside, excess B12 is stored (AdCb in somatic mitochondria and MeCb in the liver) - in fact, you can have up to four years&#39; worth of excess B12 stored in your liver, since around 95% of your used cobalamin is recycled. However, anything in excess of that ~four year mass of vitamin B12 will be excreted in your urine or feces.<br>I was wondering if there was a known link between the mass storage of vitamin B12 in the liver and the biomarker of aging through dysregulation of DNA methylation.

They were trying to live forever through resetting all of this with earth&#39;s natural magnetic energy and the cosmos energy through the pyramids. Sounds crazy but those pyramids and sphynx together have huge flood water damage and are much older than the Egyptian civilization that has lived there. Also sounds crazy but aging is important for you to understand the cost of your sin - the way you live your life with error. You do things wrong and there is a cost for that. If you were to erase the natural cost of sin in your life then you would not also have erased the sin and so then what you actually erase is learning and reproof in your life. It&#39;s the lessons we learn that are more important than even the stuff of this life. If you aren&#39;t learning from your mistakes, from your sin, then you will become a cancerous tumor from within, on a level that has never been in the history of all mankind and no never will be. Repent of your sins and turn to Jesus Christ. We are living like the Sumerians in the modern day, listening to the teaching of demons who understood the secrets of the universe and taught those secrets to mankind before their time so that man was led into every sort of opportunistic advantageous near sighted selfish sort of living. And this is exactly the goal of those demons, to create eternal life in this life, to subvert God&#39;s decree that, &quot;In the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.&quot; Do not throw your lot in with these people. Drink hot tea, not boiled, from simmering pure mineralized water and you will do well. Drink good wine, aged in animal skin. Eat fermented foods that were naturally fermented in clean fresh air and some sunlight. Put pain away from your body and stretch and BREATHE. It says in the scriptures that &quot;The breath is the lamp of Yahweh, searching the innermost parts.&quot; You need to breathe to stop aging. Yahshua said this, &quot;Anyone who keeps my word will never die.&quot; And that is the only way to do it. Yahshua said, &quot;And I know that his commandment is eternal life.&quot; You need to understand that God is trying to save you from your sin from the ONLY ROOT cause of your death that is in you.", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T17:12:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Goldmund", "comment_text": "this is the most fascinating stuff, i&#39;ve heard for a while.

There are dozens of other teams that have promising results in preventing and reversing aging. Including one that has already gone through Stage 1 clinical trials. Many are using different methods to prevent different causes (as mentioned in the video there are 8-9 known causes of aging) so the entire known process of aging may be cured around the same time even if individual treatments by single teams prove to not be enough by themselves. I say known because I imagine that we\u2019ll start to have to worry about new age-related problems when we get older that we don\u2019t because we die so young. The big one I can foresee is the brain reaching its storage capacity (currently unknown how many years it can store), which we could find out happens around a century, or perhaps we can get a full millennium out of it. Neuralink or other BMI could likely help provide solutions to that problem though. Still it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll find some other problems, but if we get even an extra two decades from current treatments, then that\u2019s an extra two decades to cure those problems before they become problems. In other words, there is a relatively good chance that in two decades those who are alive and can afford the medicine can expect to live however long they desire. The big question then is who will be able to afford it. At first we can fully expect that these drugs will be quite expensive. Depending on the nature of them though, they may still be something that middle-class residents may be able to afford, especially if they are of the type that reverses significant parts of aging with minimal drug application, a kind of drug you may only need to take every 50 years or so, longer if you live healthily. Considering it may be possible to leave retirement with such drugs, it may be worth it to get a small loan if needed then get work to pay it off and prepare for the next round. Any that require constant administration would likely be something only the very rich or very determined could afford at first, but even without those many could gain decades through the other drugs that could help them better afford these drugs if they use the money set aside for retirement to help them through school or training themselves. And of course how many people can afford it will depend on how quickly these drugs go generic. Considering that there could be lots of patented drugs that are doing different things to arrive at the same destination, we could have actual competition as well that\u2019ll bring down prices before they go generic, in theory at least.

It&#39;s a lot harder to change their beliefs than to just wait for them to fade away. Add in the higher agression levels on average, from more widespread lead exposure in certain age groups, and perhaps it&#39;s better for people from the past to slowly fade away. To be clear I&#39;m not an ageist, and I&#39;m talking about statistic generalizations and stereotypes on a national or even global level. That said even if we achieve widespread biological immortality, the population of new younger people will mean that the elderly become outnumbered by younger and more and more progressive people, hopefully drowning out their negative (e.g. racist) beliefs while preserving their historical knowledge of things like the rise of fascism so that we don&#39;t forget the lessons of history and are able to prevent such atrocities in the future.", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T15:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G & O Gaming", "comment_text": "I can\u2019t believe he thought he had to tell us that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell...<br><br><br><br>It\u2019s the only thing we all remember from biology...", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T15:44:35Z", "likes_count": 63}, {"comment_by": "Xeno Bardock", "comment_text": "What if you backup your entire healthy genome on computer at lets say age 20 and overwrite your genome in every cell every few years or so with nano-machines or something to prevent aging?

There is certainly truth to the claim that it would further draw a divide between the wealthy and the poor, as the sheer disparity in lifespan and healthspan would be made even more apparent. But at the same time, the extension of life could be the solution to many problems we face. A lot of things we wish to see to fruition usually take generations of people just to manifest, whether it be cultural paradigm shifts, scientific discoveries or the convincing of people that thiccness isn\u2019t the same as being fat. If we just had more time, perhaps it would be easier to achieve these goals. After all, those who initiate such movements would have the time to spur them on. Just take Stephen Hawking\u2019s untimely death one year prior to the first black hole image as an example.<br><br>Even on the more micro scale, it could hold many benefits for the common man. We would have more time to spend with loved ones, more time to figure out what we are truly passionate about, more time to find our ikigai (Japanese term for \u201creason for being\u201d) and more time to just live. Often we\u2019re so caught up in the minutiae of life because we\u2019re always afraid of not having enough time for everything. But by halting aging, we could change all of this. It\u2019s just my opinion, but I personally feel that stopping aging wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing if utilized well. As very aptly said by CGP grey, humans will not miss the reaper of death and construct one, just as we do not mix water and waste now that we are able to separate them.
