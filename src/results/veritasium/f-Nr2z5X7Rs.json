The full implications of even a single sighting being genuinely real is almost to good to be true, it confirms everything I&#39;ve wished for my whole life, and many others. The reality we are in here and now isn&#39;t real in the way we think it is. It&#39;s real because we believe it&#39;s real and all there is, but there is a shocking bigger picture. Peoples heads might literally explode if they suddenly could comprehend what this bigger picture is, it is that shocking. I could never <del>fully</del> believe in an optimistic worldview like this with all the apparent suffering in nature - animal suffering, how could a loving &quot;god&quot; setup a world with that going on.

There is no such thing as death, conscious death, we aren&#39;t bodies but have been forced into believing we are, we are in fact something FAR FAR more than mere bodies. Genuine consciousness is the only real value thing in all existence. It has been unfairly farmed through our suffering for the benefit of the power brokers ruling this world. It is allowed to happen like this, because it also serves as the ULTIMATE test of true character and true love.

We were in total 7 adults and 5 kids doing it. The motion in the ocean :) began and every new person that entered the pool felt it and had to go with the\u00a0flow direction. The funny thing is that we did this every day for a week and everybody believed that this was a pool that had fans and they swam around and around enjoying\u00a0the\u00a0pool.

On another occasion, seeing &quot;why no one could measure the speed of light&quot;, I came up with a way to measure it and I would love to tell you what you think. It is really simple in theory. It is done exactly the same as today, that is, it is emits a beam of light and we see how long it takes to come and go, with the difference that we interpose a massive body in the trajectory and we use the deformation of space-time generated by the massive body. You will realize that the only way to do so is that the light must travel at the same speed outward as it does back. In addition, if it is not fulfilled, both speeds can be recalculated according to the deflection of the light beam.

Until they do we will never get out of this health emergency. \r<br>If you all produce an episode and release it at the same time my hope is that you will flood YouTube&#39;s logarithm and push the misinformation into the background. \r<br>And maybe &#39;Susan&#39; can coordinate the timing of release of everyone&#39;s video. \r<br>If you already made a video on this then use that to save time.\r<br>But having watched and learned how you get recommendations it seems there is a way to push the good science forward if everyone does it at the same time. \r<br>Another suggestion is that everyone collaborate if it helps to sync the release. \r<br>I&#39;ve heard that you have meetings or conventions at some point. So there must be a channel where you can talk to each other to make this work. \r<br>If I&#39;m wrong then all you did was create a informative video. But if it works you might convince someone to get vaccinated and stop listening to all the BS that is being feed to them because of some political reason. And no do not make this about politics. It should be just science driven and no sides taken. My hope is that if you can get enough people to watch you might get them to realize they have been getting the wrong info from people that don&#39;t have their best interests at heart. \r<br>Also on top of asking them to get vaccinated  also ask them to wear a mask and give the reason in a scientific way. \r<br>Ok thanks for reading this and considering it. \r<br>I will be posting this exact message to ask many of the channels I follow that I respect.\r<br>I also realized that it might be good to keep this project quiet if everyone decides to do it because I would not want the misinformation channels to find out and then interfere with the release. Remember I am trying to overcome the logarithm.\r<br>I am sending a copy of this to the Whitehouse. It seems that later today President Biden announce new ways to help people get vaccinated.

Do you believe this? I say this because most of our choices were shaped by what others told us, especially our parents. The satanists, buddhist, muslims and traditionalists are following their god mainly because men told them it\u2019s the right god to serve. And you know that all these gods can not all be right because most of their beliefs contradict one another. All these gods can\u2019t be the true god. All of them cannot give hope of a splendid life after death. There can only be one governor in a state any other governor is an impostor. There has to be one that\u2019s right and the other wrong.<br><br>So my question, how are you sure beyond any form of doubt that the god (man) you\u2019re following is the right man? This question led me to study various spiritual leaders to know the right one among them.<br><br>I found that \u2026 Buddha once told his followers to \u201cseek for the truth\u201d. Confucius also said \u201cI am not the way\u201d. Mohammed also said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going after death\u201d. But I found a man that said \u201cI am the way, the truth and life. No one goes to the father except through me\u201d. He\u2019s the only man to ever say this and PROVE IT with not with mere words from mouth but with infallible proofs.<br>This man also said, he will take his followers to Paradise. Even while he was dying he told a thief that believed in him that \u201ctoday, you\u2019ll be with me in Paradise\u201d. He said \u201che will raise anyone that believes in him up at the last day\u201d. And he proved this by rising up from the dead and ascending to heaven physically.<br><br>He gave his followers hope of Joyful life after death in heaven. This man is the only man in human history to resurrect from the dead all by himself. A man that tried it D\u2019Lawrence was struck dead by thunder. This man lived a perfect life while in earth. He never sinned, never hurt or kill anyone. He did only good while he was on earth. Even the dating system of our world is splitted into two (BC and AD) because of him. BC means before Christ and AD signifies After Christ birth. We are in 2021 because it is 2021 years after Jesus\u2019 death.<br><br>This man is Jesus Christ. He died for you on the cross so he can take away your sin and give you life. Just as fruits have to die so that the seed in them can have life and spring forth. He died for you so you can have life and rise up after your death into the eternal glory he has prepared for you.<br>He stands at the door of your heart knocking open your heart to him. He loves you so much, he want to be your lord and supply you all you need for life. He wants to floud the chambers of you heart with peace and Joy that only him and nothing else can give. Don\u2019t deny yourself of this free gift of Christ. Accept him into your life as your master and he will give you rest.<br><br>Say these words to make him your lord. \u201cLord Jesus, I renounce the fake gods I\u2019ve been following. I cancel every evil covenant I\u2019ve been involve in. I repent of my evil and sinful ways. I accept you and my lord. I make you my lord.

UV fluorescence is in the VISIBLE light range. It consists of UV light being turned into VISIBLE light. Being able to see in the UV spectrum therefore doesn&#39;t help an organism see UV fluorescence any better than an organism that is able to only see in the visible light spectrum. At night, a fluorescent organism looks pretty much the same to every other organism with color vision as it does to humans (ie, they just look like blurry dark blobs). Sure, there are differences among organisms in their sensitivity to different wavelengths of light, but humans actually have a peak sensitivity around that of the fluorescence of scorpions (in the green wavelengths, around 555nm). <br>I find the idea that fluorescence itself (ie. the absorption of uv light and the emission of its energy as light in the visible spectrum) has an adaptive value to be unbelievably unlikely, PARTICULARLY among nocturnal organisms. Even when the moon is full and the sky is clear and unobstructed, moonlight is already MUCH weaker than sunlight, and the difference in the UV spectrum is even larger. The amount of UV light that the moon reflects is TINY, so the idea that organisms have specifically evolved mechanisms to turn that minuscule amount of UV light into an even more minuscule amount of visible light (amounts which are not visible) just seems utterly insane to me. I think that to answer the animal fluorescence question, it would be much more useful to figure out which chemicals are involved, what other functions they may have, and whether changing the specific chemical bonds involved in the fluorescence would have any effect on those functions.<br><br>IF the fluorescent mechanism has any adaptive value, it is probably in the opposite way people usually talk about it- it would be in making the fluorescent areas LESS visible, in the UV spectrum. The absorption of UV light means that those UV rays aren&#39;t being reflected, so the fluorescent areas are a bit darker in the UV spectrum.

Did they try this? I mean, if the scorpion can detect light with its body, it might be able to detect the faint glow of the cyan-ish fluorescent body regardless whether it is being lit by the cyan-ish light or a shorter wavelength that happens to be absorbed and emitted as cyan-ish. Maybe they cannot directly detect UV light, but they have this feature to indirectly notice if they are being exposed to UV. If they behave identically when lit by a faint cyan-ish color, which they could detect, it would be strong evidence for this hypothesis. Their &quot;eyes&quot; or whatever receptors cannot detect UV, like some insects do. I personally do not buy the &quot;sunscreen&quot; hypothesis about UV protection. I do not expect that they use the fluorescence to communicate - they would need to actively change the amount of the fluorescent chemical in various parts of their body to create patterns. This was not seen in the video. It migth be possible to do some genetically modified scorpions that would not produce the fluorescent chemical. These &quot;knock out&quot; group could be observed and their behavior compared. It would be best to have some really secure piece of land where to do the experiment.

Scorpions have very poor eyesight and no receptors for heat in their exoskeleton that is also very susceptible to drying out despite their ability to not be able to drink or eat prey items for long periods of time so their reaction of glowing lets them know when they&#39;re in the sun and not burrowed. They feel the reaction of the glow and know to hide and burrow to get away from it to regulate temperature. Veratasium touches on the subject and gets close with hypothesis 6 &quot;detecting light&quot; but this scientist throwing out 5 other random ideas as to why is a shame to invertebrate zoologists all over the world. It&#39;s been proven that exposing scorpions to UV light for too long can reduce their hunting capabilities and can be quite damaging to them.
