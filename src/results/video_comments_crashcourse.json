I had my neighbors come over to check cause my moms at the airport and my dad was thirty minutes away. Lately, there&#39;s been sightings of gang members in my area and one was caught a couple doors down with an AR-15.  I called my neighbors and we didn&#39;t find anyone but we think if anyone did come in the sound of the video playing at full volume may have scared them off. So thanks John Green for helping me survive dual credit AND possibly scare away a robber.",

They were constantly waging war against their neighboring tribes.  They raped, murdered, tortured and enslaved other natives and stole their property and lands.  Their torture methods were extraordinarily brutal: flaying (skinning people while alive), scalping, cutting the hearts out of live people to hold the still beating heart in their hands, building fires in tied and staked people&#39;s bellies while they were alive, throwing babies in fire ant hills, cutting off the eye lids and then burying the tied up people to their necks facing the summer sun so that they would go blind, among other pleasantries.  They were not noble benevolent savages",

Like spoiled, angry children, they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave. A social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice, voluntary cooperation and moral integrity as liberals do. A political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent, drive, personal appeal and work ethic, and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population as liberals do. And a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over-regulates and over-taxes the nation&#39;s citizens, corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state as liberals do. The roots of liberalism and its associated madness can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind. When the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims, rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives, the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious. Basically liberalism is a willful failure to mature beyond adolescence that can have catastrophic consequences for society. With luck, the official diagnosis of this disease by mental health professionals will facilitate the search for a cure.",

                "comment_text": "Ugh...One thing that really annoys and frustrates the hell out of me was that when describing the Spanish Empire and its relationship to the Natives, John literally only mentioned the negative, but then in discussing the English, he starts out by saying that the relationship was initially beneficial and then outlines their trade relationship?! As if the Spanish didn&#39;t trade, build, intermarry, or also have any positive interactions with the Natives?! And yeah he later describes English atrocities, but he at least mentioned initial positives about the English whereas he didn&#39;t do the same for the Spanish. And it&#39;s disappointing because Crash Course is usually good about trying not to be clouded by bias. But I guess English bias won out here. -_-",

Of course people are going to make propaganda to reinforce the idea that their enemy are the wrong doers and they are innocent. That is a natural thing for humanity to do.  It&#39;s easy to see that it was wrong after decades of peace and reflection with an abundance of historical records at our finger tips.  Not so easy to see when you&#39;re caught up in it.",

Every time a public event takes place it is started by a host saying &quot;we are so honoured and privileged to be using the land of the clay clay tinay.&quot; And we cannot have an assembly at school without the group of indigenous peoples playing their home made drunks thay we were all forced to make in art class in honour of the Metis. lets not forget about how they changed the man of the oldest park in my city &quot;Fort George Park&quot; to &quot;clay clay tinay memorial park&quot; because a piece of land which was already fenced off and well maintained was at one point a native burial ground. Not that Fort George park got its name for being the location of a fur trading fort that played a major roll in the Confederation of Canada. What about the &quot;status card&quot; where everyone who is up to 1/16th indigenous gets special privileges just for being native. Such as being able to hunt without tags; free public university, free healthcare for the stuff that general health care doesn&#39;t cover, or free food provided at public schools just for first nations. Oh and dont even get me started on the different title we have to use every few years. like natives, first nations, indigenous peoples. The list just goes on. But no I&#39;m just a privileged white male aren&#39;t I.",

We should start differentiating between what people say and what they actually believe. As long as our president is an attorney it is hard to prosecute Federal justices. This makes it hard to prosecute justices. This leaves Judge Angela Arkin &amp; David Japha appointing attorneys to people to sell them out. I suspect there are near zero legal rulings in the country at the moment. When pro-se litigation pushes them to destroy more and more of the checks and balances, they end up with a 1929 rush to steal everything from everybody before the public wakes up to their danger. David Japha has to chose whether to destroy DORA or back down and allow me to partially enjoy some of the legal entitlements in my divorce case 13DR30128.",

There are hundreds upon hundreds of these sales contracts in colonial archives giving the lie to those that flippantly claim &quot;The English stole Indian land!&quot; It is one of the most common left wing lies about the early colonists.",

I know I could get a lot of hate for this from people saying that there have been worse treatments of people&#39;s but I just feel for these guys more. They were an amazing society and civilization who the colonists drove nearly to the point of extinction. Any evil we could have attributed to them is excused by what the colonists did to them.",

I suggest for people to actually\u00a0go\u00a0to a Federally recognized reservation a learn the real history form the source and not from some average PhD or expert\u00a0on the subject who is\u00a0not native or whos\u00a0never even set foot\u00a0on a reservation haha trust me. As a actually native\u00a0who is in college, ive had a college professor who is non-native\u00a0says hes a expert on native American history and was teaching a majority of history form my tribe haha\u00a0he tried to school me on my own history which was far, far incorrect so I told\u00a0him, in the middle\u00a0of his\u00a0lecture that he was full of shit and it was incorrect.\u00a0I explained my background and ended up teaching him my own history and was speaking in my native\u00a0language to him\u00a0haha\u00a0he&#39;s response to me was that I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about, I was wrong and all the stuff I was saying was incorrect and\u00a0my native language was incorrect, that it didn&#39;t even belong to that tribe. All the junk he was saying was correct because he had a degree in such subject, that he knows all my tribes history and struggles... ect! haha",

                "comment_text": "This video gets a lot right! In particular, good job of being explicit regarding the fact that Indigenous Americans weren&#39;t &quot;primitive&quot; or uncomplex human beings. However, the video also inadvertently perpetuates some misunderstandings and factual inaccuracies about Indigenous Americans (plus an incorrect historical date).\u00a0<br>1) First up, many Indigenous peoples have requested that people be as specific as possible and name their individual tribe(s) when referring to them so as to avoid confusion and dispel the myth that Native peoples aren&#39;t diverse. For instance, Debbie Reese (an educator who runs the awesome blog, American Indians in Children&#39;s Literature) is a Nambe Pueblo woman. If I didn&#39;t know that she&#39;s Nambe Pueblo, I&#39;d say that she&#39;s Indigenous American or Indigenous or Native American or sometimes Native (always with a capital &#39;N&#39;; &quot;the natives&quot; is disrespectful) - there&#39;s not a lot of consensus on which term is &quot;correct&quot; within the Indigenous community at large, but do avoid obviously outdated terms. It&#39;s best to avoid the term &quot;Indian&quot; because many Indigenous people find that term offensive due to its geographical and linguistic inaccuracy (depending on which origin of that term we&#39;re following). There are times when you describe conflicts or treaties involving &quot;the Indians&quot;, which might cause confusion about which specific tribes you&#39;re referencing in which regions.<br>2) The visual representation of Pocahontas is stereotyped. In this video, Pocahontas looks more like a Plains Native person than like the Powhatan person she was. Getting appearances right individualizes and accurately places various Indigenous peoples so that non-Native audience members don&#39;t discount Indigenous peoples as a homogenized group. Historical and cultural accuracy is especially important in a video about history.<br>3) The first English settlement attempt wasn&#39;t in 1607. (However, that was the first British settlement attempt after Queen Elizabeth&#39;s death and the official govt unification of England and Scotland). Sir Walter Raleigh made two settlement attempts in 1584 and 1586 or 1587 (depending on sources). These settlements are also important to mark because they played important roles for Indigenous and English people alike. What we do and don&#39;t know about the Roanoke colony founded in 1586 says a lot about early Indigenous American/English relations.\u00a0<br>4) Pocahontas may never have participated in the infamous &quot;saving John Smith&#39;s life&quot; ceremony. John Smith wrote of several similar stories wherein girls or woman of stature made grand gestures to save his life. It&#39;s thought that he might&#39;ve been capitalizing on stereotypes about people of color (&quot;good savage&quot; maiden vs. &quot;bad savage&quot; men) as well as playing in to his own self-importance in order to sell his sensational book account of his travels. However, it&#39;s true and sensitive to point out that if such a ceremony took place, it was very likely to demonstrate the Powhatans&#39; authority over or to &quot;adopt&quot; Smith rather than being any actual threat on Smith&#39;s life.<br>Not that the video pushes the popular but false romantic tale, but for the record, Pocahontas and Smith were never romantically involved. She was a young girl at the time of the supposed life-saving incident. Years later when she saw Smith again in England, she was so upset to see him that she went off on her own for several hours. Another time, she accused him of lying. It&#39;s clear that Smith was someone who&#39;d somehow wronged Pocahontas as opposed to being the hero figure that he made himself out to be.<br>5) It&#39;s questionable whether Smith at one point told the settlers to stop stealing food from the Powhatan people. However, Smith did demand food from the Powhatan people by threat of military force against them. Many Powhatan people were aware that the English posed a longterm threat long prior to the tensions that led to Opechancanough&#39;s leadership in organized acts of defense of Powhatan land rights.\u00a0<br>6) It&#39;s worth noting that according to the Mattaponi&#39;s history (the Mattaponi people have close ties with the Powhatan people), Pocahontas&#39; son wasn&#39;t the child of John Rolfe, but the child of her first marriage to a Powhatan man. Pocahontas may have been coerced into marrying Rolfe after she was taken captive by the English. Rolfe was in the tobacco trade, among the first to exploit this plant that is sacred to so many tribes. The image that textbooks favor of Pocahontas being a kind of symbol for a happy-though-temporary unification of Indigenous and Anglo/European cultures is largely a myth, and understanding her real story is key in honestly portraying history.<br>7) Nathaniel Saltonstall&#39;s accounts of Native brutality against English settlers during the Pequot War are suspicious. In &quot;Narratives of the Indian Wars, 1675-1699&quot;, Saltonstall is proved to be an unreliable narrator; in addition to some other confused remembrances on Saltonstall&#39;s part, it&#39;s at one point noted by the book&#39;s editor in regard to a letter detailing one Native/English conflict that, &quot;The whole account is exaggerated,&quot; and is contradicted by a contemporary of Saltonstall&#39;s. It is entirely contrary to the traditional values of most Indigenous American societies to rape, to abuse animals, and to refuse quarter/not take captives. This is not to oversimplify Native peoples or to claim that they&#39;re incapable of touching on the dark side of humanity that lives in each of us. For instance, after the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876, Lakota, Arapaho, and Cheyenne warriors were still so enraged by the United States military&#39;s recent massacres of Indigenous women, children, elders - everyone who was present at the Native camps that the Indigenous warriors decapitated the bodies of the dead White soldiers on the battlefield. However, it is true that throughout American history, Anglo/Europeans&#39; accounts of Native peoples&#39; violence against colonizers have often been exaggerated and sometimes outrightly fabricated. For example, with increased respect for Indigenous peoples&#39; oral histories and new historical evidence, the practice of scalping is now widely believed to have been learned and used in retaliation by Native Americans only after Anglo/Europeans brought the practice to the Americas. At the very least, it should be said that Saltonstall&#39;s accounts are, if true, an example of Indigenous peoples equaling the instruction of inhumane acts first seen performed by Anglo/Europeans. On average, Indigenous Americans had harsher penalties against rape, strongly respected animals&#39; welfare and opposed wasting any part of animal which could be used, thought of the mutilation of an enemy as dishonorable, and treated captives/prisoners of war better than Anglo/Europeans did.\u00a0",

I&#39;m not sure if this is correct, but I learned in my APUSH class that the Pequot&#39;s were blamed for killing an English trader who wanted to trade with tribes associated with the French. This caused some group (forgot the name) to kill the trader and blame it on the Pequot&#39;s who were then persecuted by England and the New England colonists. I don&#39;t know if this is real or not but I would want clarification please.",

Americans are so quick to forget that the English founded NZ also, and that the English fought a global war against slavery far before the Americans decided it was time to end it (Abolition of the Slave Trade Act 1807). At least we signed a treaty so that the Queen could protect them from the French and Russians as well as the bad element among the early pre-colony settlers.",

That Canadian history is interesting. Look, I love my country and all, but it takes a real homer to think that Canadian history is as interesting as American history.

Luckily it is losing some of its purchase, as it should, but I don&#39;t judge people too harshly for using it.",
